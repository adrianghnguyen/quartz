## Thoughts

I finished the book and I'm not sure what to think. My heart hurts and pangs for those two children who are terrorized by their peers. Is it a showcase of strength to be weak - to not comply to the will of others? Is it courageous to suffer the burdens and to accept them?

I'm not sure how much of it is learned helplessness - but [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|I'm glad]] those two had each other. To feel ostracized and different, to question why the world is so cruel to one another. However, if one can find meaning, one can bear any kinds of suffering.

There was passage which talks about the nature of rebellion - I'm not sure what to make of it just yet. The book showcases a deep and intimate relationship from the POV of one character, to see the sense of yearning and love for the other who understands them yet my initial instinct was that how much does he truly know about Kojima? Perhaps it is a reflection of myself to seek too much of another. To understand that we are similar to one another may have more importance than to mirror their lives.

The main character makes the choice to undergo a relatively trivial surgery - one which he could have had at any moment in his life to regain a sense of normalcy. Through this action, he sheds his last remaining tie to his friendship with Kojima.

At the final incident at the Jardin des Baleines, they both chose different paths.
