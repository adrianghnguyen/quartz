# The Spiritual Connection to Nature of the Japanese

## Context on how I Found This Passage

I found this book called "Japanese death poems: Written by zen monks and haiku poets on the verge of death" while checking out the [[Third Place|library]]. It's one of my favorite activities ([[My hobbies and favorite activities]]).

I didn't read through all of it but I checked out a few of the poems. It's very interesting to hear what the monks have to say as they're on their deathbed.

## Japanese Mysticism and the Natural

> Some Western scholars, perhaps with a trace of Christian condescension, have called Japanese mysticism "natural" distinguishing it from "spiritual" mysticism.
>
> And yet how wise and humane is the culture that does not contrive au otherworldly supreme being to rule this world, the only one we know. One might ask what there is to be gained from "spiritual" sovereign who disturbs the peace of man with commands to act one way or another, promising in exchange an eternal world where scent, shape, and color never marr.
>
> Indeed, even today the Japanese share a deep identification with nature. This is not nature as understood by Western religions, the work of a creator who stands apart from his work, but nature bursting with vitality, appearing and disappearing in cycles of life and death, of summer and winter, spring and fall.
>
> The Japanese aspire to clarity of awareness, as of a mirror reflecting natural phenomena in its many forms And anyone who has seen a Japanese stand silently for a good hour to view the blossoming cherries in spring and the reddening maples in fall, or to gaze at the full moon in the autumn sky, knows that this is no mere gesture of aesthetic appreciation, but an act of worship.^[p. 38 Hoffmann, Y. (2015). Japanese death poems: Written by zen monks and haiku poets on the verge of death. Chāruzuītatorushuppan. ]

### Personal Reflections on the Passage

Here the author mentions about the perceived superiority of the white man in regards to their approach of spiritualism by saying that their spiritual sovereign aka god is superior to the eastern view that nature is abundant with life or vitality, with cycles of rebirth and death.

Similar to what the Buddha would've preached. I wonder how much if this plays into Shintoism which I don't know much about.

The Japanese philosophy is that nature is "bursting with vitality, appearing and disappearing in cycles of life and death, of summer and winter, spring and fall."

They practice mindfulness ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]]) when they gaze at the beauty of nature and a cherry tree with its blossoming flowers. It is appreciation of the moment and a type of worship to nature.
