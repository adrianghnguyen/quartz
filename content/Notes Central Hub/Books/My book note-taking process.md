## Overall Steps

- Read book
- If non-fiction/educational, try and understand book structure in order to conceptualize how information will be presented
- Read books and create bookmarks/highlights
	- Digest some thoughts - but don't sweat it too much. If something is highlighted and you forgot about it when you return to make notes, maybe it wasn't that important after all.
- On book note document page
	- Begin writing atomic notes per relevant highlight. Refactor into their own notes as needed.
		- If you begin writing from the book page, it will create backlinks.
	- Not all highlights are used. Some are useful for aliases.
	- This is a time consuming process
	- Write personal reflections
- Writing it out
	- Import the highlights
	- Link the book highlights within summary
	- Begin writing notes
		- Don't worry too much about citations unless there are specific claims to be made.
		-  I have my original links to the kindle highlights if I need to return to a passage one days
	- Use Note Refactor plugin as I go to split by H2 headings to make them into individual atomic notes
	- Write thoughts and reflections at the end to summarize what I've learned

## Process Tips

- Get book summary from Libgen.rs when you search for a book.
