# The Book of Disquiet The Complete Edition by Fernando Pessoa

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> For the first time—and in the best translation ever—the complete Book of Disquiet, a masterpiece beyond comparison The Book of Disquiet is the Portuguese modernist master Fernando Pessoa’s greatest literary achievement. An “autobiography” or “diary” containing exquisite melancholy observations, aphorisms, and ruminations, this classic work grapples with all the eternal questions. Now, for the first time the texts are presented chronologically, in a complete English edition by master translator Margaret Jull Costa. Most of the texts in The Book of Disquiet are written under the semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, an assistant bookkeeper. This existential masterpiece was first published in Portuguese in 1982, forty-seven years after Pessoa’s death. A monumental literary event, this exciting, new, complete edition spans Fernando Pessoa’s entire writing life.

## Thoughts and reflections

Perhaps it is someone who can put into better words my thoughts and feelings - the paradox of self-awareness. It might be the culmination of nihilism and to undertake the act of self-creation for one's purpose. I wouldn't say that I'm a misunderstood genius, but that there is so much about my inner world to which I could convey.

I was first made aware of this book through the following video: [The Terrible Paradox of Self-Awareness | Fernando Pessoa - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qU1sDBU9Cs) while browsing late at night on [[2023-06-25]] and was caught in a moment of [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]].
