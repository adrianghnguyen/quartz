# Talent Is Overrated by Geoff Colvin

![cover|150](http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IzzooXGE6GgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api)

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> Debunks both talent and experience as the determining factors and instead makes a case for [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]], [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] and starting early.

> The text explains that practice and experience are two different things, using the example of musicians who achieved success through deliberate practice rather than inherent talent. It emphasizes that simply repeating the same tasks over time does not lead to improvement, but rather, new and unfamiliar experiences are necessary. The importance of starting deliberate practice early in life is discussed, as it allows children to practice more, benefit from a support network, and take advantage of their brain's ability to learn quickly. The text concludes by suggesting that forcing deliberate practice on children can trigger their inner drive and ultimately lead to a genuine passion for the activity.

Funny because that's essentially [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]].
