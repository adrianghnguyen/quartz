## Thoughts and Reflections

I had quit Unity because I feel like I had a bad manager who was causing me a lot of work stress in our interpersonal interactions. As of [[2023-01-09 Mon]], am I really worse off or was it an opportunity for me to grow in different ways?

It takes time to have a meaningful career. I was perhaps too hasty in wanting too much too soon. This book helps explain how [[Career capital|career capital]] is hard to achieve and requires patience.

This passage was interesting as when I received my [[Career Psychology Survey Results|career survey results]] I was astonished by the fact that I was high in so many interest categories. I wasn't sure where I wanted to develop my career from there on out. Do I go back to school to become a therapist? Or do I stay in tech and develop my expertise in data engineering. After having read the book, I'm pretty confident that I need to stay the course and just keep chugging along and go down the path of data engineering.

[[2023-01-29 Sun]] I realize that the key is to keep building expertise.
