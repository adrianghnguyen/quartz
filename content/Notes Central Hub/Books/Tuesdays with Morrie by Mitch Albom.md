## Thoughts and Reflections

I think this book was recommended to me by [[Sally Au Yeung]]. I don't remember much but learning people's life lessons on their deathbed is definitely sobering.

### Thoughts on [[2023-02-02 Thu]]

I just went on Sparknotes to see if I could jog my memory about what the life vignettes were and got the two aforementioned quotes.

>  This demand to keep his mother's death a secret proves a terrible emotional burden for young Morrie; he keeps the telegram all of his life as proof that his mother had existed. Because he was starved of love and affection during his childhood, Morrie seeks it out in his old age from his family and friends. Now that he is nearing his death, Morrie says that *he has reverted to a figurative infancy*, and tries in earnest **"enjoy being a baby again."** He and Mitch often hold hands throughout their sessions together.^[https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary/]

## True authenticity

I think that true authenticity ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]]) is about learning to become a child again - free of cultural imprint ([[The various ways of loving yourself]]) and living free of societal desire.

> In his lessons, Morrie advises Mitch to reject the popular culture in favor of *creating his own*. The individualistic culture Morrie encourages Mitch to create for himself is a **culture founded on love, acceptance, and human goodness, a culture that upholds a set of ethical values** unlike the mores that popular culture endorses. Popular culture, Morrie says, is founded on greed, selfishness, and superficiality, which he urges Mitch to overcome. Morrie also stresses that he and Mitch must accept death and aging, as both are inevitable.^[https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary/]

I've always considered myself somewhat of a person who aspired for higher ethical values. I would imagine that reading this book had reinforced my desire to be a good person and live a proper life. Love is one of the few limitless resources we have in this world so we should treasure everyone and the precious moments they give us ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]). With my current knowledge, it's how I imagine [[Gia-Hien Nguyen]] would've lived if he were still with us today. Everyone says that he radiated kindness and love…I'd like to follow in his footsteps. I miss you [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|dad]].
