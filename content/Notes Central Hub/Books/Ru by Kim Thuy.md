![cover|150](http://books.google.com/books/content?id=m8lC4x2UG4wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api)

## Summary

The novel tells the tale of a woman, An Tinh Nguyen, born in Saigon in 1968 during the Tet Offensive who immigrates to Canada with her family as a child.

The book switches between her [[childhood]] in Vietnam where she was born into a large and wealthy family, her time as a boat person when she left her country for a refugee camp in Malaysia, and her life as an early immigrant in Granby, Quebec. The story is told by a first-person narrative.[1]

## Thoughts and Reflections

It was the first book which opened my eyes to the reality of the boat refugees of Vietnam. My parents, and family all went through much suffering which they do not mention much today except in tidbits. It was a realization to hear of all their little anecdotes be confirmed - to move from the realm of a story told to the true lives of someone I know and cherish.

It also helped me understand, but not forgive, why vulnerability, and emotions are something which are luxuries of peacetime. In war, there is no time for sadness, for regrets. All your strength must be directed forward and move on.

With this book, I was able to begin talking about my [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grieving process]] with my [[Tran Huynh|mom]].
