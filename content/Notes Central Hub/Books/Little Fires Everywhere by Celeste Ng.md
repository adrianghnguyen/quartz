## Summary

Mia had been a surrogate mother but ended up keeping Pearl. Motherhood is examined from multiple angles - what is a mother? what makes a good mother?

## Highlights and Quotes

## Thoughts and Reflections

A book recommended to me by [[Adena Lin]].

The book is interesting as it's written by an Asian author. Seeing the Richardson mother made me think of white privilege and the white-savior complex. Out of the 'kindness' of her heart, she rents out her home to the ones who fell through the crack. She had good intentions but we end up seeing that her ego comes into play.

The novel also asks us the following question: Is it better for a child to be adopted into wealthier circumstances if it might rob them of their cultural heritage and connection? The character Bebe Chow, feeling desperate, feels like she needs to give up her baby for adoption. However, as her circumstances change and stabilize, she regrets her decision and ends up taking back her child from the adoptive family.

While the subject of custody is in play, the Asian defense attorney talks about how his own daughter could not find an Asian Barbie doll. When he looks at children's books, how many feature good representation of Asian heritage? Although some adoptive parents probably have the best intention, to what extent can they really give the cultural heritage one deserves?

While illustrating the metaphor of the Barbie doll, he highlighted how the default is 'white'. It's somewhat close to home, maybe because I recently read [[Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong]] and just the invisibility Asians do to pass off as white. Growing up, I was one of the 3 Asian kids in the school. To be made fun of for being different, to be made to feel like an 'other'. How did that impact me?

Lastly, the youngest son Moody, is a friend to Pearl and falls head over heels for her. He becomes her friend, tries to be nice and is the one who introduced her into the Richardson family. However, she ends up falling for Moody's older brother Trip, which shatters Moody and Pearl's friendship. I guess this makes me think of the parallel how I feel about [[Lily Jiang]] with me seeking to be her friend, developing feelings and realizing that maybe we weren't on the same page after all. Food for thought. I guess the difference lies is that I simply took some distance while he became embittered.
