## Atomic Notes

> Visualizing complex systems as machines, figuring out the cause-effect relationships within them, writing down the principles for dealing with them, and feeding them into a computer so the com puter could "make decisions" for me all became standard practices.
>
> Don't get me wrong. My approach was far from perfect. I vividly remember one "can't lose" bet that personally cost me about $100,000. That was most of my net worth at the time. More painful still, it hurt my clients too. The most painful lesson that was repeatedly hammered home is that you can never be sure of anything: There are always risks out there that can hurt you badly, even in the seemingly safest bets, so it's always best to assume you're missing something. This lesson changed my approach to decision making in ways that will reverberate throughout this book and to which I attribute much of my success. But I would make many other mistakes before I fully changed my behavior. P22

understand the fundamentals and establish models even if imperfect

….

> While making money was good, having meaningful work and [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|meaningful relationships]] was far better. To me, meaningful work is [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|being on a mission]] I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me.
>
> Think about it: It's senseless to have making money as your goal a money has no intrinsic value its value comes from what it can buy, and it can't buy everything. It's smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. Money will be one of the things you need, but it's not the only one and certainly not the most important one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want.
>
> When thinking about the things you really want, it pays to think of their relative values so you weigh them properly. In my case, I wanted meaningful work and meaningful relationships equally, and I valued money less-as long as I had enough to take care of my basic needs. In thinking about the relative importance of great relation- ships and money, it was clear that relationships were more important because there is no amount of money I would take in exchange for a [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|meaningful relationship]], because there is nothing I could buy with that money that would be more valuable. So, for me, meaningful work and meaningful relationships were and still are my primary goals and everything I did was for them. Making money was an incidental con- sequence of that.

Money is a resource not an end

> "He who lives by the crystal ball is destined to eat ground glass is a saying I quoted a lot in those days. Between 1979 and 1982, I had eaten enough glass to realize that what was most important wasn't knowing the future-it was knowing how to react appropriately to the information available at each point in time. In order to do that, I would have to have a vast store of economic and market data to draw on and as it happened, I did.

Models are useful when used in time. Knowledge decay. Know enough to commit to an action.

…

P.40-41 this Passage talks about using computers as digital second brains and assimilating mass information. It performs a symbiotic relationship with us. We teach it how to work better and likewise it can show us where we have might have missed mass information since we are limited in our memory.

Computers are good at running algorithms but lacking strategic thinking and conceptual thinking.

…

> I believe one of the most valuable things you can do to improve your decision making is to think through your principles for making decisions, write them out in both words and computer algorithms, back-test them if possible, and use them on a real-time basis to run in parallel with decision making. P43

If one understands fundamental principles they start seeing new relationships and how the world works. Understand the axioms to understand how complex systems work. Test your assumptions, revise, improve.

…

> In the story of Bunker hunt, as well as that of Alan Bond, two men who were on top of Mount Olympus fell I lost their empire because they failed to hedge and diversify.

Understand your risks on the downside and make sure you have a mitigation plan. What's the opportunity cost if the worst thing is realized? Move from there.

…

> Despite passing up this great opportunity, I don't regret that I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones. P48

Focus on the important stuff like Warren Buffet

> I've also learned that [[Be less critical of others by taking a pause to reflect|judging]]  people before really seeing things through their eyes stands in the way of understanding their circumstances and that isn't smart. I urge you to be curious enough to  [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|want to understand]] how the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way. You will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what you should do.

It makes me think that perhaps I would like to be in a position to do more travelling and [[Curiosity as my worldview|discovering new things]]. I do think that my curiosity has not been sated recently and I have not had the ability to [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|discover new things]]. Perhaps because my ego is being defensive…because I'm scared of the future which is becoming more concrete as I know which path I would like to take? yet the road to it seems unclear and I do not know what I seek just yet… To do good in the world? To connect with others. Yet the advice which rings to my mind is…do more and think less. You'll learn something along the way. Trust yourself.

…

I had always wanted to have-and to be around people who also wanted to have-a life full of meaningful work and meaningful relationships, and to me a [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|meaningful relationship]] is one that's [[Honest communication is clear|open and honest]] in a way that lets people be straight with each other. I never valued more traditional, antiseptic relationships where people put on a façade of politeness and don't say what they really think.

I believe that all organizations basically have two types of people: those who work to be part of a mission, and those who work for a paycheck. I wanted to surround myself with people who needed what I needed, which was to make sense of things for myself. I spoke frankly, and I expected those around me to speak frankly. I fought for what I thought was best, and I wanted them to do so as well. When I thought someone did something stupid, I said so and I expected them to tell me when I did something stupid. Each of us would be better for it. To me, that was what strong and productive relationships looked like. Operating any other way would be unproductive and unethical.

Build something which you can be proud of. P.52 at worst you'll learn something, at best you'll have given something back to the world.

All great investors and investment approaches have bad patches; losing faith in them at such times is as common a mistake as getting too enamored of them when they do well. Because most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results; they give up and sell low when times are bad and buy too high when times are good. I find this is just as true for relationships as it is for investments-wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the [[Understanding the complexity of life|ups and downs]], while flighty people react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they're hot and abandoning them when they're not.

Make an error log. Track your learned lessons and do it without judgement to learn how to improve the machine.

[[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|Fork in the road decisions]]. Take the time to process information as there's always a third way to have part of your cake and eat part of it. Use time as resource

This looked to me like another one of those fork-in-the-road cases in which I had to choose between one of two seemingly essential but mutually exclusive options: 1) being radically truthful with each other including probing to bring our problems and weaknesses to the sur- face so we could deal with them forthrightly and 2) having happy and satisfied employees. And it reminded me that when faced with the choice between two things you need that are seemingly at odds, go slowly to figure out how you can have as much of both as possible. There is almost always a good path that you just haven't figured out yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you

. Since I was a kid, I've learned by doing. I'd just dive in after things I wanted and try to survive long enough to learn from my mistakes and improve. If I changed fast enough to become sustainable at whatever I was doing, then I would build on that to flourish. I've always had great faith in my ability to figure things out, and over time my need to figure things out made me better at doing so. As a result, I tended to hire people who were the same way-who would dive right into challenges, figure out what to do about them, and then do it. I figured that if they had great character, common sense, and creativity, and were driven to achieve our shared mission, they would discover what it took to be suc- cessful if I gave them the freedom to figure out how to make the right decisions. I knew that micromanaging and handcuffing them wouldn't work because neither of us would like it. If I was the one telling them what to do, I wouldn't be getting any leverage from them. Besides, I didn't want to work with people who needed that.

Just dive into things and you'll figure out as you go. Dive into making my journal brain?

Shapers or influential people

Isaacson's book and the article pointed to other parallels in our backgrounds, goals, and approaches to shaping-for example, we were both rebellious, independent thinkers who worked relentlessly for innovation and excellence; we were both meditators who wanted to "put a dent in the universe"; and we were both notoriously tough on people. Of course, there were important differences too. I wished Jobs had shared the principles he had used to achieve his goals.

___

It turns out they have a lot in common. They are all indepen- dent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are extremely resil- ient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it. Perhaps most interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can't. All are able to see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people see just one or the other. They are simultaneously ative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren't excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world.
