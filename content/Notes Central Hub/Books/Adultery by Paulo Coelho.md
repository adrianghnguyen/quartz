# Adultery by Paulo Coelho

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> I want to change. I need to change. I'm gradually losing touch with myself. Adultery, the provocative new novel by Paulo Coelho, best-selling author of The Alchemist and Eleven Minutes, explores the question of what it means to live life fully and happily, finding the balance between life's routine and the desire for something new.

## Thoughts and reflections

### Mixed message - my bad

I anticipated a thorough deconstruction of adultery, but instead found a story of [[The various ways of loving yourself|personal acceptance]] and [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|self discovery]]. This expectation might have [[Brains are biased by nature|biased my judgment]].

I feel uneasy with the plot's journey to deliver its underlying message. However, I understand that that art's value is not measured through its quality but in its capacity to stir our emotions. A hated yet memorable sculpture is more impactful than an immaculate, but forgettable one. While I do not feel to be qualified to review this book, as a reader, I cannot deny the craft of Mr. Coelho's written word with its magnetic pull.

Tis' but a train wreck in slow motion. Grab the popcorn - we're in for a doozy.

This experience left me wondering if this is the allure found in reality TV.  Perhaps it is not necessary to be in love with a story for one to be appreciative.

### Mansplain this to me

One source of my discomfort is the fact that a man wrote the book. It raises the following question: Is it perpetrating the trope of the 'femme en folie' -- hysteria? Is it seeking to portray women as emotionally unhinged beings?  Art should seek to challenge our thoughts, yes, but perhaps not at the cost of propagating stereotypes. The book presents the following: 'Affection and self-control became more important,' referencing the diverse ways in which women express love and their interactions with the world.

That being said, it's essential to remember that humans have more similarities than differences. [[Intra vs Intergroup differences|Differences within a group can often explain as much as differences between groups]]. While the portrayal of women in the book feels somewhat reductive— perhaps an unfortunate product of a patriarchal perspective— I can acknowledge that it might just be the depiction of one woman's experience, albeit written by a man. A caricature draws attention through exaggeration, not realism.

See also [[Sexual desire is spontaneous or responsive and everything in between|Sexual desire is spontaneous or responsive and everything in between]] to understand how sex drive is a poor justification for Jacob and Linda's motivations.

### Love and self-love (not the touching yourself kind, but there's some of that too)

My sincere belief is that [[Love is the pursuit of our emotional home|Love is a pursuit of our wholeness, seeking an emotional home]]. We strive to form connections to alleviate a [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|fundamental sense of loneliness]]. We possess an abundance of hopes and dreams that we yearn to share with the world. It's interesting that the the author uses the imagery of rebirth through flight and return to the womb to signal her character's end of journey. According to Alain de Botton, the womb is where one basks in complete safety before entering a world fraught with danger and uncertainty.

Love and self love define [[The Happiness Equation|meaning and purpose]] in our lives.  [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|You are meant to be loved as you are]] - no need to be anything else. As for Linda, her [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|unresolved issues]] from her childhood have fractured, turning into shards of glass that scatter and cut her feet as she embarks on her personal journey.

From a psychological standpoint, our pursuit of love is often about repairing past attachments to our childhood primary caregivers, as eloquently explained in [[Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix|Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix]]. This process continues through our adulthood with our partners who become our new attachment surrogates.

### Adultery as an act of personal despair

After further reflection, my initial hatred and disdain for Linda's character was replaced by a profound sense of pity.

Is it fair for me to judge from a moral high ground when one is not in the eye of the storm? Is it fair for me judge her inability to turn inwards, reflect and connect with her loved ones? I believe that the remedy to a pit of despair is to seek [[Having meaning in life reduces personal suffering|personal meaning]].  [[Infidelity|Fucking another person]]? Well, that's just a poor substitute.

Undeniably, she's a disaster, ignoring external counsel at every turn. Yet a part of me, wishes to support her evolution into a better individual.  Life is often punctuated by [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|sliding door moments, where one has the option to embrace others]] rather than retreat from moments that [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|expose our vulnerabilities]].

It can be challenging to empathize with the character who exhibits such profound learned helplessness, but perhaps we are all on our own unique paths. Despite everything, I harbor hope for her healing.

Turns out [[Sustaining long term romantic desire in monogamous relationships|Sustaining long term desire in monogamous relationships is quite complicated]] huh?

### Jekyll and Hyde

If I were granted one superpower, it would be the ability to gaze deep into the enigma of another person's mind. Through Adultery, we plunge deep into a women's descent from 'perfect life' to internal death followed by rebirth of the self. Linda's worries and concerns animate her darkest fears.

Her journey brings us the reader into an quasi-intrusive trespassing of Linda's private thoughts, bordering on the line of non consent and vulgarity. However, it does bring a sense of gratitude through a sense of [[Reading is a shared lived experience|shared lived experience, if only momentarily through its written words]].

Amongst the various emotional hardships that a human can endure, [[Neurochemistry of love|loss of connection is often the most searing - the very opposite of love]], formenting a deep sense of personal rejection of *notre raison d’être*. Sometimes, refuge is found in the unfavourable places such as [[Broken attachment driven sex|infidelity]]. Despite my disapproval of such behavior, this deep-seated sense of denial of one's soul is something with which I can empathize.

Few possess the [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|courage]] to [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|delve deep into their emotions]]. Linda could have, at any point, veered towards her husband and share her inner turmoil. Our sense of alienation. Of [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|feeling misunderstood]]. [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|Shared affection creates a bridge of understanding]] reminding us of our collective humanity.

Few people are intrinsically cruel. More often than not, I was graced with [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|kindness in my darkest moments]], despite my [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|apprehensions and anxieties]] - life in such moments shines in [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|full splendour]]. Healing [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|emotional wounds]] often necessitates a generous share of patience and nurturing. [[Being patient leads to better decisions|Be patient and kind with others.]]

### Stick the ending please?

WTF was that? Some enroll in therapy. Others decide to "touch grass". Linda chose to fly the sky and has a metaphorical come to God moment.  Woe is me, yet culpability never shows its face. Absent. Gone - to the milk store perhaps.

I struggle to accept the rapidity of her personal acceptance during the paragliding experience when it is presented so abruptly. Her lack of remorse is worrisome. Hints of [[Apologizing sincerely requires action|sincere regret]] are non-existent. As a reader, it is an emotional whiplash to see her reconcile her duality of Jekyll and Hyde, the Frankenstein she embodies in so few pages.

However, upon stepping back from my initial reactions, I find myself awash with pity for her. It's heartbreaking to witness an individual repeatedly making poor decisions. Am I too harsh in my judgment? Am I contributing to the society which created this Frankenstein? We place burdensome [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|expectations]] on individuals - but perhaps she's on the precipice of her self-discovery.

She could have [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|shown her true self]] yet she chose to retreat [[Cultural roots of shame|into the comfort of society's given role]]. Often [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|emotions supersede rationality]]. [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|Cognitive dissonance]]  enables hurtful acts while allowing us to turn a blind eye to [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|the monster we have become]]. Every moment in our lives presents an opportunity for choice. Some choose to be swept away in life's current. Others seek to confront its raging tides.
