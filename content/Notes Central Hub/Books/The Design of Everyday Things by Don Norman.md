# The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman

## Book information

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman is a book that explores the relationship between people and the products they use. Norman argues that many products are poorly designed, making them difficult or frustrating to use, and that this is often due to a lack of understanding of how people interact with technology.
> The book begins by discussing the concept of affordances, which refers to the perceived possibilities for action that an object offers. Norman argues that good design should make these affordances clear and intuitive, so that people can easily understand how to use a product.
> Norman also discusses the importance of feedback in design. Feedback helps users understand how their actions are affecting a product, and can help prevent errors or confusion. He argues that good feedback should be immediate, informative, and relevant.
> Throughout the book, Norman provides numerous examples of good and bad design in everyday objects, from door handles to computer interfaces. He also discusses the role of cultural norms and expectations in shaping how people interact with technology.
> In conclusion, The Design of Everyday Things is a thought-provoking exploration of how design can shape our experiences with technology. It offers practical insights for designers and engineers looking to improve their products' usability, as well as for consumers who want to better understand why some products are easier (or harder) to use than others.

### Thoughts and Reflections

It's a book I read a long time ago but never finished. I started re-reading it out of random interest because I was wondering if there were software design principles I could gain from it. An interesting thing to  note is that Don Norman switched from being a designer to being a cognitive psychologist. While reading the book, it seems like it's my entire undergrad psychology classes all put together.

I messaged [[Richard Yang]] about it and it was interesting to note that everything relates back to psychology or how our brains process information ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]).
