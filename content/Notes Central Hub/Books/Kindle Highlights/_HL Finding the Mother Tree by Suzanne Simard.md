"this network is pervasive through the entire forest floor, connecting all the trees in a constellation of tree hubs and fungal links. A crude map revealed, stunningly, that the biggest, oldest timbers are the sources of fungal connections to regenerating seedlings. Not only that, they connect to all neighbors, young and old, serving as the linchpins for a jungle of threads and synapses and nodes. I’ll take you through the journey that revealed the most shocking aspect of this pattern—that it has similarities with our own human brains. In it, the old and young are perceiving, communicating, and responding to one another by emitting chemical signals. Chemicals identical to our own neurotransmitters. Signals created by ions cascading across fungal membranes."  ^ref-62157

"Scientists had recently figured out that mycorrhizal fungi helped food crops grow because the fungi could reach scarce minerals, nutrients, and water that the plants couldn’t. Adding fertilizers full of minerals and nutrients, or providing irrigation, artificially took care of things, causing the fungi to disappear. When the plants didn’t have reason to spend energy investing in fungi to meet their needs, they cut off the flow of resources."  ^ref-9586

"year. The seedlings planted in the old-growth soil were thriving. As predicted, the seedlings without transferred soil, or with the dead, radiated transferred soil, were dead. They had met the usual morbid fate that had been plaguing them—and us—for years. I dug up samples of the seedlings and took them home to my microscope. As I expected, the dead seedlings had no new root tips. But when I looked at the seedlings grown in the old-growth soil, I jumped out of my chair. Merde! The root tips were covered with a dazzling array of different fungi. Yellow, white, pink, purple, beige, black, gray, cream, you name it. It was about the soil."  ^ref-35927

"Pine got nitrogen from alder not through the soil at all but thanks to mycorrhizal fungi! As though alder were sending vitamins to pine directly, through a pipeline. After mycorrhizal fungi colonized alder roots, the fungal threads grew toward the pine roots and linked the plants. I figured the nitrogen moved from the rich alder—with its buckets of the stuff—to the poor pine through this linkage, flowing down a concentration gradient."  ^ref-63464

"The measurements I’d taken in my experiments provided only part of the picture. They missed what we could not yet fully see: how the symbiotic bacteria and mycorrhizas in the roots of the alder, and the other invisible creatures in the soil, helped the pine. And they failed to illuminate the bigger picture: that interactions over resources isn’t a winner-take-all thing; it’s about give-and-take, building more from a little and finding balance over the long term.

"I understood the policy was meant to ensure that public forests were left populated with healthy, free-growing trees after the harvests, but in their zeal, the policymakers seemed to have forgotten that the forest is much more than a collection of fast-growing trees. Gunning for fast early growth by weeding out native plants in hopes of future profits was not going to end well. For anyone.

"Once on solid footing, life running as smoothly as a stock market exchange, the growing root could then support a fungal mantle—a coating—as though donning a jacket of mycelium, from which even more fledgling hyphae could grow into the soil. The thicker the mantle and the greater the number of fungal threads the root could feed, the more extensively the mycelium could laminate the soil minerals, and the more nutrients it could acquire from the grains and transport back to the root in trade. Root begets fungus begets root begets fungus. The partners keeping a positive feedback loop until a tree is made and a cubic foot of soil is packed with a hundred miles of mycelium. A web of life like our own cardiovascular system of arteries, veins, and capillaries."  ^ref-61774

"This forest was like the Internet too—the World Wide Web. But instead of computers linked by wires or radio waves, these trees were connected by mycorrhizal fungi. The forest seemed like a system of centers and satellites, where the old trees were the biggest communication hubs and the smaller ones the less-busy nodes, with messages transmitting back and forth through the fungal links. Back in 1997 when my article had been published in Nature, the journal had called it the “wood-wide web,” and that was turning out to be much more prescient than I’d imagined. All I knew back then was that birch and fir transmitted carbon back and forth through a simple weave of mycorrhizas. This forest, though, was showing me a fuller story. The old and young trees were hubs and nodes, interconnected by mycorrhizal fungi in a complex pattern that fueled the regeneration of the entire forest."  ^ref-27157

"Instead of the fungi of knapweed helping the grasses thrive, as they had with birch and fir, they were accelerating the decline that had begun with humans herding cattle.

Like the invasion of the body snatchers. Or the colonization of the Americas by Europeans."  ^ref-40034

"But once their roots and mycorrhizas reach the labyrinth of russet pores, where water clings in films to soil particles, they ratchet up their game and grow a foundation. A root system like that, unfettered in its opportunity, was far more resilient than the chunky pistons grown in Styrofoam tubes in the nursery, where the seedlings intended for plantations were so stuffed with water and nutrients they couldn’t—didn’t need to—sprout adequate roots to partner with fungi to connect with the soil."  ^ref-3146

"The old trees were the mothers of the forest. The hubs were Mother Trees. Well, mother and father trees, since each Douglas-fir tree has male pollen cones and female seed cones. But…it felt like mothering to me. With the elders tending to the young. Yes, that’s it. Mother Trees. Mother Trees connect the forest. This Mother Tree was the central hub that the saplings and seedlings nested around, with threads of different fungal species, of different colors and weights, linking them, layer upon layer, in a strong, complex web. I pulled out a pencil and notebook. I made a map: Mother Trees, saplings, seedlings. Lines sketched between them. Emerging from my drawing was a pattern like a neural network, like the neurons in our brains, with some nodes more highly linked than others."  ^ref-47514

Comment: Neural network in trees

---
"If the mycorrhizal network is a facsimile of a neural network, the molecules moving among trees were like neurotransmitters. The signals between the trees could be as sharp as the electrochemical impulses between neurons, the brain chemistry that allows us to think and communicate. Is it possible that the trees are as perceptive of their neighbors as we are of our own thoughts and moods? Even more, are the social interactions between trees as influential on their shared reality as that of two people engaged in conversation? Can trees discern as quickly as we can? Can they continuously gauge, adjust, and regulate based on their signals and interactions, just as we do? Just from the inflection of the way Don says “Suze,” and from his brief glances, I comprehend his meaning. Maybe trees relate to one another as delicately, with such attunement. Signaling as precisely as the neurons in our brains do, to make sense of the world. I scribbled quick calculations based on our isotope work. It occurred to me that the amount of carbon transferred relative to nitrogen was strikingly similar to their respective quantities in molecules of an amino acid called glutamate. We hadn’t exactly sought in our experiments to trace glutamate’s carbon-nitrogen movements, but other researchers had verified that the amino acid itself did move through mycorrhizal networks. I did a fast search on my BlackBerry. Glutamate was the most abundant neurotransmitter in the human brain, and it set the stage for other neurotransmitters to develop. It was even more abundant than serotonin, whose carbon-to-nitrogen ratio was only slightly greater."  ^ref-40505

"How similar could the mycorrhizal network really be to a neural network? Sure, the pattern of the network and the molecules transmitting from node to node through the links might be similar. But what about the existence of the synapse; isn’t that crucial to signaling in a neural network? This could also be important in a tree detecting whether its neighbors were stressed or healthy. Just as neurotransmitters pass signals across the synaptic cleft from one neuron to another in our brains, signals might also diffuse across a synapse between interfacing fungal and plant membranes in a mycorrhiza. Could information be transmitted across synapses in mycorrhizal networks, the same way it happens in our brains? Amino acids, water, hormones, defense signals, allelochemicals (poisons), and other metabolites were already known to cross the synapse between the fungal and plant membranes. Any molecules arriving by way of the mycorrhizal network from another tree might also be transmitted through the synapse. Maybe I was onto something: both neural networks and mycorrhizal networks transmit information molecules across synapses. Molecules move not just through the cross walls of adjacent plant cells and the end pores of back-to-back fungal cells, but also across synapses at the apices of different plant roots, or different mycorrhizas. Chemicals are released into these synapses, and the information must then be transported along an electrochemical source-sink gradient from fungal-root tip to fungal-root tip, similar to the workings of a nervous system. The same basic processes, it seemed to me, were occurring in the mycorrhizal fungal network as in our neural networks. Giving us that flash of brilliance when we solve a problem, or make an important decision, or align our relationships. Maybe from both networks emerge connection, communication, and cohesion. It was already accepted widely that plants use their neural-like physiology to perceive their environment. Their leaves, stems, and roots sense and comprehend their surroundings, then alter their physiology—their growth, ability to forage for nutrients, photosynthetic rates, and closure rates of stomata for saving water. The fungal hyphae, too, perceive their environment and alter their architecture and physiology. Like parents and children, my girls and Don and me, adapting to change, aligning to learn new things, figuring out how to endure. I’d be home tonight. Mothering. The Latin verb intelligere means to comprehend or perceive. Intelligence. The mycorrhizal networks could have the signature of intelligence. At the hub of the neural network in the forest were the Mother Trees,"  ^ref-28683

"The thick pipelines of fungal species like Rhizopogon were designed for long-distance communication, and the fine mycelial fans of fungal species like Wilcoxina must be adept at rapid response. Able to transmit chemicals swiftly to trigger fast growth and change. When Grannie Winnie was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, I’d read about what makes our brains either plastic or rigid. Maybe the long-distance Rhizopogon were analogous to the strong links in our brains arising from repetition, pruning, and regression, giving us long-term memory. Maybe the finer Wilcoxina hyphae, which grew faster and more abundantly, helped the mycorrhizal networks adapt to new opportunities, not unlike our own rapid, flexible responses to new situations, which Grannie was losing."  ^ref-5691

"My colleague Yuan Yuan’s tomato plant had not only transmitted warning signals through the interlinking arbuscular network to its neighbor about a pathogen infection, but the neighbor upregulated its defense genes in response. Even more, the neighbor’s genes got to work and produced an abundance of defense enzymes. These enzymes must have subdued the pathogen, because when the fungus was applied to the eavesdropping tomato, it incredibly did not cause disease. Yuan Yuan had come to help me ask the same of ailing firs, to see if the pines stood a better chance in their new environment because the firs signaled the nature of their plight."  ^ref-39805

"If dying trees communicate with incoming species, we might use this knowledge to better assist the migration of tree species as the old forests become maladapted to their native places. A warning-and-aid system—those infested Douglas firs telling pines to upgrade their defense arsenal, for instance—might be important for the growth of the new species or races (genotypes) as the old forests were dying back. As the injured Mother Trees slowly folded their cards, did they transmit their remaining carbon and energy to their offspring? As part of the active dying process. Like senescing grasses, handing over their remaining photosynthates to boost the next generation. Maybe they just dispersed the content of their dying cells randomly to the rest of the ecosystem, since energy is neither created nor destroyed."  ^ref-62586

"Even slight injury to the firs elicited an enzyme response in the pine. The firs were communicating their stress to the pines within twenty-four hours. What the trees were conveying made sense. Over millions of years, they’d evolved for survival, built relationships with their mutualists and competitors, and they were integrated with their partners in one system. The firs had sent warning signals that the forest was in danger, and the pines had been poised, eavesdropping for clues, wired to receive the messages, ensuring the community remained whole, still a healthy place to rear their offspring."  ^ref-39116

They communicate and send carbon, the building block of life, not just to the mycorrhizas of their kin but to other members of the community. To help keep it whole.

"Grown intimately together, this forest had almost twice the productivity of the stands where we’d trenched between the species two decades earlier. This was the opposite of the usual foresters’ expectations. They figured that fir roots free of birch interference would obtain more of the resource pie, as though the ecosystem worked as a zero-sum game—the adamant belief that greater total productivity cannot possibly emerge from species interactions. Even more surprising to me was that birch benefited from fir too. Not only did birches likewise grow at twice the rate when intimately connected with firs than when alone, but they also had fewer root infections. The birches that had delivered food and good health to the firs when they were young were now being helped in reciprocity by the bigger firs as adults."  ^ref-56164

"I had been given a glimpse of these ideals—almost as a stroke of luck—through the rigid lens of western science. I’d been taught in the university to take apart the ecosystem, to reduce it into its parts, to study the trees and plants and soils in isolation, so that I could look at the forest objectively. This dissection, this control and categorization and cauterization, were supposed to bring clarity, credibility, and validation to any findings. When I followed these steps of taking the system apart to look at the pieces, I was able to publish my results, and I soon learned that it was almost impossible for a study of the diversity and connectivity of a whole ecosystem to get into print."  ^ref-61786

"“We’d like to design our city in a way that mimics the patterns of mycorrhizal connection,” wrote a city planner from Vancouver. The concept of the Mother Tree and her connections to those around her had even made it into Hollywood, as a central concept to the tree in the film Avatar. How the film resonated with people reminded me how naturally crucial it is for people to connect to mothers, fathers, children, family—our own and the families of others—and to trees and animals and all of the creatures of nature, as one."  ^ref-2985

"Salmon in this way connecting the ocean with the continent. The Secwepemc people knew how vital salmon was to the interior forests, and to their livelihoods, and they’d cared for the populations according to far-reaching principles of interconnectedness."  ^ref-19105

"Of knowing that we are tied to the land—the trees and animals and soil and water—and to one another, and that we have a responsibility to care for these connections and resources, ensuring the sustainability of these ecosystems for future generations and to honor those who came before. Of treading lightly, taking only what gifts we need, and giving back. Of showing humility toward and tolerance for all we are connected to in this circle of life. But what my years in the forestry profession have also shown me is that too many decision-makers dismiss this way of viewing nature and rely only on select parts of science. The impact has become too devastating to ignore. We can compare the condition of the land where it has been torn apart, each resource treated in isolation from the rest, to where it has been cared for according to the Secwepemc principal of k̓wseltktnews (translated as “we are all related”) or the Salish concept of nə́c̓aʔmat ct (“we are one”)."  ^ref-33659

"We must heed the answers we’re being given. I believe this kind of transformative thinking is what will save us. It is a philosophy of treating the world’s creatures, its gifts, as of equal importance to us. This begins by recognizing that trees and plants have agency. They perceive, relate, and communicate; they exercise various behaviors. They cooperate, make decisions, learn, and remember—qualities we normally ascribe to sentience, wisdom, intelligence. By noting how trees, animals, and even fungi—any and all nonhuman species—have this agency, we can acknowledge that they deserve as much regard as we accord ourselves."  ^ref-45131

"“and in clusters, not in rows.” Trees need to be near one another, to establish in receptive soil, to join together to build the ecosystem, mix with other species, relate in patterns that produce a wood-wide web, because the forest becomes resilient from this complexity. Scientists now are more willing to say that forests are complex adaptive systems, comprised of many species that adjust and learn, that include legacies such as old trees and seed banks and logs, and these parts interact in intricate dynamic networks, with information feedbacks and self-organization. Systems-level properties emerge from this that add up to more than the sum of the parts."  ^ref-29337

"Once the system hits a tipping point, once good decisions are made and acted upon, and when parts and processes are enmeshed again, and the soil rebuilt, recovery is possible—at least in some places."  ^ref-36148

"There is no moment too small in the world. Nothing should be lost. Everything has a purpose, and everything is in need of care. This is my creed. Let us embrace it. We can watch it rise. Just like that, at any time—all the time—wealth and grace will soar."  ^ref-33385

"an emergent philosophy: complexity science. Based on embracing collaboration in addition to competition—indeed, working with all of the multifarious interactions that make up the forest—complexity science can transform forestry practices into what is adaptive and holistic and away from what has been overly authoritarian and simplistic."  ^ref-10767

"We have the power to shift course. It’s our disconnectedness—and lost understanding about the amazing capacities of nature—that’s driving a lot of our despair, and plants in particular are objects of our abuse. By understanding their sentient qualities, our empathy and love for trees, plants, and forests will naturally deepen and find innovative solutions. Turning to the intelligence of nature itself is the key."  ^ref-46174
