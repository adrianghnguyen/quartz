## Highlights

"A Type 2 child who believes his or her feelings are not being heard may become very stressed. In young children, this can look like whining, pouting, or a tantrum. In an older child, it may look more like sulking, excessive silence, or withdrawal. Give them your full attention, express that you genuinely want to hear them, and emphasize that they can take their time in telling you whatever they want to. You will find that your childâ€™s gentle and sensitive demeanor returns." ^ref-44260
