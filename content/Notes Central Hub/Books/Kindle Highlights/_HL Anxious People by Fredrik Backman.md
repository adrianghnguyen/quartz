"We don’t have a plan, we just do our best to get through the day, because there’ll be another one coming along tomorrow."  ^ref-45984

"Older men rarely know what to say to younger men to let them know that they care. It’s so hard to find the words when all you really want to say is: “I can see you’re hurting.”"  ^ref-46343
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"No one goes to see a psychologist to talk about all the times they weren’t hit in the head by a swing as a child."  ^ref-37353
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"Because that was a parent’s job: to provide shoulders. Shoulders for your children to sit on when they’re little so they can see the world, then stand on when they get older so they can reach the clouds, and sometimes lean against whenever they stumble and feel unsure. They trust us, which is a crushing responsibility, because they haven’t yet realized that we don’t actually know what we’re doing. So the man did what we all do: he pretended he knew."  ^ref-2461

"moral hazard."  ^ref-44263

"The truth of course is that if people really were as happy as they look on the Internet, they wouldn’t spend so much damn time on the Internet, because no one who’s having a really good day spends half of it taking pictures of themselves. Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit. Not that that really makes much difference, because now we’ve learned that every day needs to be special. Every day."  ^ref-25650

"One technique I’d recommend is to ask yourself three questions before you flare up. One: Are the actions of the person in question intended to harm you personally? Two: Do you possess all the information about the situation? Three: Do you have anything to gain from a conflict?”"  ^ref-16117

"I’ve been here before. I know a better way down. Of course sometimes she couldn’t help thinking about the reasons why she had wanted to jump, all the things she thought were missing from her reflection. Her loneliness at the dinner table. But she found ways to cope, to tunnel her way out of herself, to climb down. Some people accept that they will never be free of their anxiety, they just learn to carry it. She tried to be one of them. She told herself that was why you should always be nice to other people, even idiots, because you never know how heavy their burden is. Over time she realized that deep down almost everyone asks themselves the same sort of questions: Am I good? Do I make anyone proud? Am I useful to society? Am I good at my job? Generous and considerate? A decent shag? Does anyone want me to be their friend? Have I been a good parent? Am I a good person? People want to be good. Deep down. Kind."  ^ref-52518

"You can always tell by the way people who love each other argue: the longer they’ve been together, the fewer words they need to start a fight."  ^ref-5198
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"Because he understood that it was an important day for Anna-Lena, and because it was important to her it was important to him as well. Because that’s how he loves her."  ^ref-51268
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say “I love you,” either. Once when they were at IKEA, very recently, Roger had suggested when they were having lunch in the cafeteria that they each have a piece of cake. Because he understood that it was an important"  ^ref-29693

"When you’ve been together for a very long time, it’s the little things that matter. In a long marriage you don’t need words to have a row, but you don’t need words to say “I love you,” either. Once when they were at IKEA, very recently, Roger had suggested when they were having lunch in the cafeteria that they each have a piece of cake. Because he understood that it was an important day for Anna-Lena, and because it was important to her it was important to him as well. Because that’s how he loves her."  ^ref-62157

"I’m very sorry about that! I’m having quite a complicated day here!”"  ^ref-1182
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"“Can you just… please? I haven’t got a plan. I need to think. It wasn’t supposed to turn out like this.” “What?” Ro asked. “Life,” the bank robber sniffed."  ^ref-36279
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"I think you can understand someone without necessarily agreeing with them, if you see what I mean?"  ^ref-27484
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"“You don’t fall in love with a gender, Anna-Lena. You fall in love with an idiot.”"  ^ref-4329
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"“We can’t change the world, and a lot of the time we can’t even change people. No more than one bit at a time. So we do what we can to help whenever we get the chance, sweetheart. We save those we can. We do our best. Then we try to find a way to convince ourselves that that will just have to… be enough. So we can live with our failures without drowning.”"  ^ref-15387
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"“God doesn’t protect people from knives, sweetheart. That’s why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.”"  ^ref-7570
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"“No, of course you don’t. But I don’t think you need fewer feelings, Zara. I think you need to feel more. I don’t think you’re depressed. I think you’re lonely.”"  ^ref-19743
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"But she also felt like telling him that the economic system she has devoted her life to working in is the world’s biggest problem right now, because we made the system too strong. We forgot how greedy we are, but above all we forgot how weak we are. And now it’s crushing us."  ^ref-49395
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"He says you end up marrying the one you don’t understand. Then you spend the rest of your life trying."  ^ref-22048
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"“He was my echo. Everything I do is quieter now,”"  ^ref-38104
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"And I… damn, I love being boring with Ro. Does that sound mad? I love arguing with her about sofas and pets. She’s my everyday. The whole… world.” “I like the everyday,” Anna-Lena admitted. “Your mom was right, the ones who make you laugh last a lifetime,” Estelle repeated, thinking of a British author who had written that nothing in the world is so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor. Then she thought about an American author who had written that loneliness is like starvation, you don’t realize how hungry you are until you begin to eat."  ^ref-58947
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"one who almost a hundred years ago wrote that your children aren’t your children, they’re the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself."  ^ref-34441
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"Estelle was thinking about another author now, one who almost a hundred years ago wrote that your children aren’t your children, they’re the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself."  ^ref-16431
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"One day he offered me his book, saying: ‘I’ve finished this one, I think you should read it.’ And so we started to swap books. He read such wonderful things. I don’t have the words to describe it, but it was like going on a journey with someone. Where didn’t matter. To outer space. It went on for a long time."  ^ref-57242
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"That’s the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people’s. One summer I opened a book and sand trickled out of it, and I knew he’d liked it so much he hadn’t been able to put it down. Every now and then I would get a book where some of the pages were crumpled, and I knew he’d been crying. One day I told him that, in the elevator, and he replied that I was the only person who knew that about him.”"  ^ref-50859
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"In the end I found myself standing in front of his bookcase. It’s such an odd thing, the way you can know someone so perfectly through what they read. We liked the same voices, in the same way. So I let myself have a few minutes to think about what we could have been for each other, if everything had been different, somewhere else in our lives.”"  ^ref-14103
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"We are asleep until we fall in love. Estelle gave him a book in exchange, one written by a woman, so it didn’t need hundreds of pages to say things. Close to the start Estelle had underlined: Love is wanting you to exist."  ^ref-57629
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"Nothing must happen to you No, what am I saying Everything must happen to you And it must be wonderful"  ^ref-64704
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"“What are you going to do from now on?” “I don’t know.” The psychologist finally has something important to say. Something she didn’t learn at college but knows that everyone needs to hear, every so often. “Not knowing is a good place to start.”"  ^ref-55966
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"‘I’m hungover’ than if they say ‘I’m suffering from anxiety.’ But I think we pass people in the street every day who feel the same as you and I, many of them just don’t know what it is. Men and women going around for months having trouble breathing and seeing doctor after doctor because they think there’s something wrong with their lungs. All because it’s so damn difficult to admit that something else is… broken. That it’s an ache in our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us, telling us we’re going to die. But there’s nothing wrong with our lungs, Zara. We’re not going to die, you and I.”"  ^ref-23762
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"They say that a person’s personality is the sum of their experiences. But that isn’t true, at least not entirely, because if our past was all that defined us, we’d never be able to put up with ourselves. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we’re more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows."  ^ref-39134
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"we do our best. We plant an apple tree today, even if we know the world is going to be destroyed tomorrow."  ^ref-24613
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

---
"We’re looking for something to cling on to, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We’re doing all we can to teach our children how to swim. We have all of this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine."  ^ref-13806
* Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

"I know I drive you crazy, but I’m crazy about you. Ducks fly together."  ^ref-58871
