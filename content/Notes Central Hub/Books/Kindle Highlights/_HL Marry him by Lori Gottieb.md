## Highlights

"The advice Greenwald gives is simple: Knock off anything as a deal-breaker that’s “objective” (age, height, where he went to college, what type of job he has, how much hair he has, whether he has kids or an ex-wife) and focus on what’s “subjective” (maturity, kindness, sense of humor, sensitivity, ability to commit)."  ^ref-6606

"“When I was dating, two qualities that never occurred to me as important but that turned out to be critical in our marriage were selflessness and humility,” she explained. “A ton of times on a daily basis in marriage, you have to decide whether to maximize your happiness or the other person’s, and my husband has proved so often to maximize my happiness. In courtship, we mistake romance for selflessness, but it’s not at all the same thing. Romantic gestures like sending flowers aren’t the same thing as waking up in the middle of the night and taking care of the baby so I can sleep.” “Also,” she continued, “humility is key—the ability to say it doesn’t really matter who’s right or wrong, and it’s okay to have different opinions about things. So I ask people, where on your list do you rank selflessness and humility when you’re rejecting a guy based on his age or height?” In fact, John Gottman, a well-known marriage researcher at the University of Washington and author of the bestseller The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, has shown that he can predict marital success with 91 percent accuracy by looking at basic qualities like compromise, tolerance, and communication style."  ^ref-48507

"When happily married women told me what they thought was important as you get older, similar themes emerged: What matters is finding the perfect partner—not the perfect person. It’s not about lowering your standards—it’s about maturing and having reasonable expectations."  ^ref-10923

"“deal” is a term Clampitt uses a lot, which may seem like an odd way of describing your spouse. But in her view, choosing to spend your life with someone involves deciding which package—which deal—works best for you given what you want out of life. “Everybody has their pros and cons,” she said, a lesson she learned from her two very different marriages."  ^ref-37236

"Clampitt matches people like this: “Number one,” she said, “I look at whether the two people have common relationship goals. Number two, I look at values. Things like independence, family, religion, loyalty. Number three, what are the key qualities this person needs? You get no more than five. Things like, he has to be very intelligent. Number four, I look at shared interests. Interests are great because it’s bonding and stimulating and fun to share those, but the other things are more important for the long-term. I put shared interests last for that reason.”"  ^ref-29790

A guy may not seem exciting on the surface, but he might offer something more exciting over the long-term: interesting ways of looking at the world; the ability to make you laugh after a long day at work; a sweet way of challenging you to become the best version of yourself; being a wonderful dad. The man of your dreams? Absolutely. He just doesn’t look the way he did in your daydreams."  ^ref-36932

"A few weeks before I called Evan, I’d spoken to Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist at MIT. He’d written a book called Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions. I told him about my situation. He said he’d heard it all before—in fact, he’d studied it. “The idea that people know what they want is quite ludicrous,” he said right off the bat. According to Ariely, not only are we confused about what we want in the moment, but we fail to take into account that our desires change through time as we deal with life circumstances like illness, financial issues, or children."  ^ref-58024
* Lori Gottlieb - Marry Him by Lori Gottlieb

Comment: Finding out what we desire through this book

---
"Ariely said yes: Knowing too much about a person sight unseen makes it harder to become interested in him. In one study, he told me, online daters were given traits of a potential partner, like the ones you’d find on an online dating site. When participants were given a higher number of traits, they perceived the person to be less similar to them than if they were given a smaller list of traits. The more traits you have knowledge of, the more information that gives you to rule someone out. It’s what he calls “the less is more effect”: If you describe yourself in more ambiguous terms in your profile, you’ll be more likable. “If you write, ‘I like music,’ and I’m reading your profile, I immediately assume that you like the kind of music I like,” he said. “But if you tell me specific music you like, we might have different interests, and that’s less attractive to me.”"  ^ref-38846

Comment: On less is more

"When that happens, Ariely said, we short-change people in a way we wouldn’t if there were fewer options. In one study, he and his colleagues got data from an online dating site and looked at people they labeled “jugglers”—those who were managing fifteen or more communications at once."  ^ref-19179

Comment: Spreadong yourself too thin produces too much noise which from making the right choice. It applies in dating with an overabundance of options

---
"That’s exactly what happened when Ariely followed these jugglers’ outcomes. He looked at people who’d exchanged phone numbers or set up dates, and found that people who juggled less not only wrote longer, more thoughtful e-mails—they also ended up going on an actual date. The jugglers, meanwhile, sat home at their computers, juggling."  ^ref-52119

Comment: Trying to juggle too many dating options

---
"To avoid these problems, Ariely and his colleagues created a different kind of online dating site. Instead of having a profile, each person was represented by, say, a red square or a green triangle, and you’d move around a virtual space. If you were in close proximity to someone, you could start talking. You could wander through an art gallery together and talk about the exhibit. You got to know each other’s personalities. You basically went on a virtual date in this virtual world—not knowing anything about each other. Then, Ariely said, these people all had to go to a real-life speed dating event. At the event, some people had been on Ariely’s site before and some hadn’t. When it was over, each participant was asked who they’d like to go on a second date with. The results? “They were twice as likely to want to go on a second date if they met through our site,” Ariely said. “How tall you are and what your hair color is—that’s not what matters, even though people say it is,” he explained. “I think in dating the issue is that we don’t know what’s important to us.”"  ^ref-64520

"I was starting to think that I had no idea what was important to me, either, especially when I ran my dating history by Eli Finkel, a newly married social psychologist at Northwestern University. I told him that I’d always sought out certain types of men, but they didn’t necessarily make me happy in the long-term. Was it possible that I didn’t know what traits I actually wanted in a mate? “If you’re like most people, then yes,” he said. Finkel told me about an experiment he’d done with his colleague Paul Eastwick to see if the characteristics that people said they required in a partner were really what they ended up finding important. First, they asked single people to report on how much they were looking for certain characteristics—from physical traits to earning potential to warm-heartedness. Subjects rated these on a scale from 1 to 9, in terms of importance. Then they had these people do speed dating. After the meetings, you’d rate each person in the room on the characteristics you’d said you were seeking. Then you’d rate your romantic interest in each person. And if later you went on a date with one of these people, you’d report on how much you enjoyed the date. Turned out, people’s stated preferences didn’t do a good job of predicting who they wanted to go out with or had a good time with. According to Finkel, “There was a lack of correlation between what people said they wanted on the questionnaire, and what they actually picked when they met a real, live person.”"  ^ref-64834

"Finkel explained it using my favorite candy from childhood, M&M’S. “If you ask people why they like M&M’S,” he said, “they might tell you it’s because of the candy shell. But if you give them another candy with the same shell, they won’t like it as much as the M&M. So it’s not the shell. It must be something else that they like about the M&M.”"  ^ref-36767

"“If you ask people why they like M&M’S,” he said, “they might tell you it’s because of the candy shell. But if you give them another candy with the same shell, they won’t like it as much as the M&M. So it’s not the shell. It must be something else that they like about the M&M.” In other words, we know that we like the M&M, but we can’t explain why. What does this have to do with dating? Everything, Finkel believes. “People can accurately tell you what they like, but not why. So if a woman says, ‘I’m attracted to this man,’ that’s accurate. She is attracted to him. But if she says it’s because he makes money, that might not be the accurate explanation. It might actually be because he’s generous.” That’s the mistake many of us make: Our must-haves and deal-breakers are the “what,” when they should be the “why.”"  ^ref-5853

"“Look for reasons to say ‘yes’ instead of ‘no,’ ” he reminded me. “Screen in rather than constantly screening out. Always ask yourself this: If an interesting guy were right in front of you, would you honestly turn that person away because of a few pounds or inches, or a sentence in a profile that you don’t like? If so, that’s fine. Just don’t complain when you can’t find anybody suitable because you’ve eliminated every potential guy on a technicality. Because if these guys eliminated people on technicalities, they probably wouldn’t date you, either.”"  ^ref-36984

"No wonder I’d screwed up my dating life: I wanted to feel secure and relaxed in a relationship, but if I was with someone truly as flawed as me, I’d feel dissatisfied because he was so different from my ideal. And if this flawed person was excited about me, I’d say he was coming on too strong or, worse, seemed desperate. But the second someone closer to my “ideal” happened to want to date me, I was constantly on edge, trying to be “on” and entertaining, and feeling insecure because those men always had countless women vying for their attention. The flawed men always seemed too excited about me, and the idealized men didn’t seem excited enough."  ^ref-7382

"“So next time you’re about to rule out some guy because he’s not your ideal, try to focus on the good things about him, because some guy is going to have to focus on the good things about you, even though he may have wanted someone more easygoing or taller. Every time you start to dissect some guy, note that he’s willfully ignoring all of this in order to go out with you. We want to be tolerated for our moodiness, but we want someone who’s never moody. We want to feel attractive even when we let our bodies go, but we want someone who’s fit. Doesn’t that seem hypocritical?”"  ^ref-45132

"He told me about a psychologist named Judith Sills, who wrote a wonderful book called How to Stop Looking for Someone Perfect and Find Someone to Love. In her book, Sills says that every person is a package deal, or like the blue plate special at a diner. There are “no substitutions.” You have to take the annoying habits and unpleasant features along with the rest of the meal. You may have to deal with a metaphorical side dish you aren’t crazy about. “If you require that someone fulfill your perfect picture,” Sills writes, “you’re in for a long-term relationship with your fantasies.”"  ^ref-65369

"The more I talked to Dr. Broder, the more I wondered if this level of self-involvement was a large part of what makes it hard to find a guy. Can it get to the point where we think we’re so special—so uniquely exceptional and appealing—that we lose perspective entirely? I used to think, yeah, I have high standards, but I can’t help it if I have good taste. (Speaking of good taste, never mind that the guys I have chosen haven’t always turned out to be so fabulous, either.) Our generation of women is constantly told to have high self-esteem, but it seems that the women who think the most highly of themselves are at risk of ego-tripping themselves out of romantic connection. The more highly we think of ourselves, the more critical we are of perfectly good guys."  ^ref-389

Comment: Entitlement

"I’ve always mentally deducted points when deciding whether to date someone. If, for example, I wanted someone smart, funny, and cute, but he turned out to be smart, funny, cute, and nerdy, I’d forget that I got the “smart, funny, and cute” and focus instead on the nerdy. I’d focus on the disappointing aspects instead of feeling lucky to have found the positive ones. That’s what entitlement can do."  ^ref-15535

"It’s almost like being an Olympic judge who gives men a “husband” rating: Everyone starts off with a 10, and then the judge deducts points for anything less than perfect. He’s not funny enough? Take off two points. He’s got a unibrow? Take off another one. Wouldn’t a better way to date be starting off at zero and giving people points for assets like kindness and warmth instead? I’ve always mentally deducted points when deciding whether to date someone. If, for example, I wanted someone smart, funny, and cute, but he turned out to be smart, funny, cute, and nerdy, I’d forget that I got the “smart, funny, and cute” and focus instead on the nerdy. I’d focus on the disappointing aspects instead of feeling lucky to have found the positive ones. That’s what entitlement can do."  ^ref-59643

"Toning down the attitude doesn’t just help in dating—it makes marriages better, too. That’s what Gian Gonzaga, a psychologist and senior scientist at eHarmony who met his wife while working in the famous “marriage lab” at UCLA, told me. His research, which involves studying six hundred couples over the span of several years, focuses on relationship satisfaction and the predictors of marriage success. “Happily married people believe that their partners are better than the average person, even though that’s statistically impossible,” Gonzaga explained. “We call those ‘positive illusions.’ It’s not that people don’t complain about their spouses or have disagreements. It’s that at the end of the day, they still see them as superior to most of the people out there.”"  ^ref-63913

"“We tend to be attracted to people who are similar to us in terms of emotional stability, intellect, and competence,” he said. “So if you date people who always seem dysfunctional, you’re probably equally dysfunctional. If this person is neurotic, you probably are, too. To attract the kind of person you have in your mind, you have to be that kind of person. It’s not that all the guys you dated weren’t good enough for you. People need to realize that they bring their own selves into the equation.”"  ^ref-4234

The next guy she dated, she ended up marrying. “After that conversation, I approached my next relationship completely differently,” she told me. “I focused on appreciating what I liked about him, and being compassionate about the things I thought were wrong. And I realized I hadn’t been appreciative of my boyfriends in the past.”"  ^ref-26283

"According to a social scientist named Barry Schwartz, there are two kinds of people in the world: maximizers and satisficers,"  ^ref-15219
* Lori Gottlieb - Marry Him by Lori Gottlieb

---
"In his eye-opening book The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, Schwartz explains the difference between maximizers and satisficers like this: Say you want to buy a new sweater. You decide that it needs to be well-fitting, stylish, not itchy, a pretty color, and in your price range. Say it even has to go with a specific outfit. A satisficer walks into a store or two, finds a sweater that meets all of these criteria, and buys it. She’s done. A maximizer, on the other hand, walks into a store, picks out a sweater that meets all of these criteria, and thinks, This sweater is nice, but maybe I should look at that cute store down the street. Maybe I can find something I like better. Maybe I can find something on sale. So the maximizer hides the pretty sweater on the bottom of the pile (so that nobody else buys it) and goes to check out another store (or five). Now, you might think that the maximizer will end up with a better sweater—after all, she’s looked at more possibilities—but that’s not necessarily the case. A satisficer isn’t looking for the absolute best, but she does have high standards. The difference is, she stops when she’s found something that meets those high standards."  ^ref-60766

"But let’s say that the maximizer does find a slightly cuter sweater, or a slightly less expensive one. Will she be happier with her purchase than the satisficer is with hers? Probably not, Schwartz says. That’s because while a satisficer is content with something great, a maximizer is content only with the absolute best. And since you can never be sure that you got the absolute best—you can’t see every sweater in the entire city; new styles will appear in store windows the very next week and you may like one of those better—the whole process is fraught with anxiety."  ^ref-18043

"Okay, a sweater isn’t a relationship, obviously, but whether it’s about a sweater or a romantic partner, satisficers tend to be happier in life than maximizers. Satisficers know when they’ve found what they want, even if it’s not perfect. Maximizers either keep looking for someone better and never choose anyone, or they choose someone but will always wonder whether they’ve settled. They don’t understand that not getting 100 percent of what we want isn’t just “acceptable”—it’s normal. When I called Barry Schwartz at Swarthmore College, where he’s a professor, he explained the maximizer’s predicament like this: “You’re continually looking over your shoulder to see if there’s something better. And the more you look over your shoulder, the less good you’ll end up feeling about your partner or a potential partner—even though he’s probably just as good, on balance, as the people you’re looking at.”"  ^ref-1408

"Instead of wondering, Am I happy?, maximizers wonder, Is this the best I can do? They experience what Schwartz calls regret in anticipation of making a decision. As he puts it in his book: “You imagine how you’ll feel if you discover that there was a better option available. And that leap of imagination may be all it takes to plunge you into a mire of uncertainty.”"  ^ref-6680

Comment: Regret anticipation in decisions

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the divorce rate of people who live together before marriage at 12 percent higher than those who didn’t cohabitate before marriage. And according to a study published in November 2008 by the sociologist Daniel Lichter of Cornell University, divorce rates for women who had lived with more than one man were twice as high as those who hadn’t. What’s going on here? Schwartz has some theories. He feels that people who live together as a “test run” might tend to be maximizers, people who want to be sure they’re getting “the best” but then are never truly satisfied. Moreover, the very act of having that return policy mentality—“If it doesn’t work out, we’ll move out”—might make people less satisfied if they do go on to get married. He told me about a study cited in his book that found that people are more satisfied with nonreturnable items than they are with returnable ones. “Almost everybody would rather buy in a store that permits returns than in one that does not,” he writes in The Paradox of Choice. “What we don’t realize is that the very option of being allowed to change our minds seems to increase the chances that we will change our minds. When we can change our minds about decisions, we are less satisfied with them.” But, according to Schwartz, “When a decision is final”—like, say, marriage instead of cohabitation—“we engage in a variety of psychological processes that enhance our feelings about the choice we made relative to the alternatives.” In other words, the longer you spend being indecisive—thinking that any given guy can be returned for another—the more likely it is that you’ll focus on his faults, and nobody will measure up. One guy might seem great, but compare him to another guy who’s smarter but more passive, and both choices start to look slightly less appealing. The first guy seems less smart, the second guy seems less proactive. It’s easy to choose between “pretty good” and “completely wrong”; it’s crazy-making to constantly choose between two pretty goods. Compared side by side, two pretty goods might start to look like two mediocres."  ^ref-38878

"“People often think they have to choose between two qualities, like looks and intelligence,” Schwartz told me. “But you’ll probably be happy with someone who has an acceptable degree of both.” In other words, nobody’s asking you to choose between the guy who’s a 3 on looks and an 8 on intelligence and another guy who’s an 8 on looks and 3 on intelligence. Most of the time, we’re faced with a guy who might be a 6 on looks and a 7 on intelligence but an 8 on lifestyle and personality—nothing extreme on either end, but overall a pretty appealing person. Maximizers consider this settling. They want an 8 on everything. Satisficers consider this a good deal. Ironically, it’s the maximizers who, years later, look at the satisficers—with their husbands and families and contentment in life—and say, “I wish I had what she has.” Well, it was there for the taking. The maximizers simply passed it up. After all, satisficing isn’t about settling for someone who doesn’t have the qualities you’re seeking. It’s about finding someone who is enough, as opposed to someone who is everything."  ^ref-18034

They’d grown up in the same area, their parents knew each other casually, and they had similar upbringings. “When I saw pictures of her growing up and compared them to pictures of me growing up,” Andy said, “it was almost as though we were in the same pictures. That made it feel right. That made it feel like home. She had a lot of the qualities I was looking for—ethical, professional, solid family upbringing, attractive, kind.

"Often Evan finds his clients listing off qualities that rarely coexist: an incredibly driven guy who also has a lot of free time to take a spontaneous day trip; a handsome charmer who also won’t attract other women’s attention at a party. “You may want both qualities,” Evan explained, “but you have to pick which is more important. I think when you look at it that way, the answer is fairly obvious. And by the way, these alpha males may not be looking for the qualities you have either.”"  ^ref-65394

"Evan shook his head. “I’m saying you have to find an equal whose strengths complement yours. The traits you find impressive in men don’t necessarily translate well in the context of a marriage: ambitious, competitive, opinionated.” “But these guys always get married,” I said. “Yeah, but do they marry you?” I tried to think of alpha males I knew and who their spouses were: full-time moms who had given up careers (and liked it that way), women with flexible low-key careers, and, come to think of it, a lot of people in the helping professions, like nurses. Unfortunately, none of that described me. “Think about it,” Evan said. “What does an alpha male get out of dating you? The world revolves around him at work. He likes intellectual stimulation and opinions. He likes challenges. But he already has that all day. What he can’t get at work are warmth, support, nurturing. You may be able to provide that, but you’re also not the most easygoing personality, and he wants his life at home to be easy. And you want a guy who can lead, but who can also compromise and let you lead. That might create conflict between you two.”"  ^ref-60722

"Diane Holmberg, a Canadian researcher and professor who studies relationships, says that’s not true and, in fact, the first date stories I hear might not even be that accurate. She’s found that married couples often change their courtship stories over time. In her book Thrice Told Tales: Married Couples Tell Their Stories, she and her coauthors analyzed how couples described their courtship in the first, third, and seventh years of marriage. It turns out their stories weren’t consistent. “I selected a set of couples who showed a major drop in their overall marital well-being,” she explained. “I then selected a second set of couples who were matched with the first set in marital well-being that first year, but stayed stable over time. I then looked at how couples talked about the early stages of their relationship.” By the third year, she found, the stable group’s courtship stories had gotten more positive than they’d reported that first year, while the less happy group’s courtship stories had gotten more negative than they’d been in that first year. But remember: That first year, these courtship stories had been identical in tone. In other words, happy couples described the early stages of their relationship more positively over time, while couples who became less happy described those early stages more negatively over time. These weren’t just first-date memories—they covered first dates up to the proposal—but it does show, Holmberg says, that there’s a kind of revisionist history going on."  ^ref-37834

"Scott Haltzman, a psychiatrist at Brown University and the author of The Secrets of Happily Married Women: How to Get More Out of Your Relationship by Doing Less, told me from his office in Providence that it’s important for women to learn this when they’re just starting to date. “My own clinical observation is that first impressions are not a strong predictor of marital success,” he said. “I’ve got a seventeen-year-old daughter, and she’ll say she went out with a guy and he was boring. I say, ‘Great, boring’s good! Better that than bad boys. If you didn’t feel a sense of danger or a wave of nausea, go out again. People mistake the nausea for interest, but if you can objectively tell yourself that a guy has some good qualities, go out again. It can take several dates just to figure out whether there’s something interesting about this person. And then you may find you’re truly attracted to him.”"  ^ref-37563

He was rude to the waiter. He didn’t ask about her life. But they sent back three hundred things! I didn’t even know there were three hundred things I could do wrong on a first date. Ten, maybe. But not three hundred! Imagine how picky you have to be to be able to name so many things that would make you not go on a second date. “But they said things like, ‘He shouldn’t talk in any other voice, even if he does the greatest Austin Powers impression in the whole world’ and ‘He shouldn’t tell her that nothing will stop him from watching the big game’ and ‘He shouldn’t wear a brown belt and black shoes, or vice versa.’ I tried this with men, and they only named a few things that wouldn’t lead to a second date: She wasn’t attractive enough.

"That reminded me of a conversation I had with a close friend one night, when I said that I wanted what she had with her husband—they seemed like the ideal combination of lovers and best friends. “Actually,” she said, “my best friend is you.” She explained it like this: “If I told my husband even half of what I tell you, he’d die of boredom and tune me out, and then we’d get into a fight about how he’s not listening to me. Besides, instead of nagging him every day, I complain to you!” I was confused. “If I’m your best friend,” I asked, “does that mean your husband isn’t?” “Maybe,” she smiled. “But I still love him more than you.” It’s a distinction she said she couldn’t make even a few years back. Then one day, frustrated that her husband wasn’t as interested in emotional topics as she was, she had a realization. “I thought, even our best friends don’t meet all our needs. That’s why we have many close friends, not just one. So why does a husband have to be an uber-friend who meets every need and shares every interest? Who can handle that kind of pressure?”"  ^ref-61891

"Men and women both have to compromise to be with a mate, but they compromise differently. For married men, the biggest compromise is sexual monogamy. For married women, the biggest compromise is not having emotional monogamy. In other words, the compromise is not having one all-encompassing emotional connection, and having to get some of that connection outside of the marriage. It’s having to accept that one human being can’t provide a level of emotional intensity that most men don’t want in the first place."  ^ref-47908

Some want what she called “better income producers.” Sure, she said, there are men in midlife crisis who initiate divorce, but more often it’s the women who want out, leaving the men confused. “The men feel like, ‘Nobody told me we were having problems. I thought everything was fine,’ ” she explained. Maybe that’s one reason that, according to a report on divorce put out by the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University, two-thirds of divorces are initiated by women.

Dating is about grand romantic gestures that mean little over the long-term. Marriage is about small acts of kindness that bond you over a lifetime. It’s quietly romantic. He makes her tea.

"In 2008, a Slate magazine article by Mark Gimein used an auction analogy to explain the low supply of men as women get older. If dating is like an auction, you’d think that the stronger bidders—the more appealing women—would “win.” Instead, Gimein says, the strong bidders are so confident in their ability to find a guy that they bid too late. While the strong bidders wait for the best possible prospect, the weak bidders—the less conventionally appealing women—bid earlier and more aggressively because they know they can be outbid. So what happens? More and more appealing men, rejected by the strong bidders, are taken off the dating market by the weak bidders. In the end, what’s left are the least appealing men—the ones even the weak bidders didn’t bid on!—along with the most appealing (but overly confident) women."  ^ref-30238

If your picture ranks in the bottom tenth, you’d need to make $186,000 more than the guy in the top tenth percentile. “Women care so much about height,” he told me, “that to be as appealing as the average five foot ten man, I’d have to earn $40,000 more per year at my height of five feet nine.” Ariely found that a 5’4” man would need to make $229,000 more than a 6’ tall man to have equal appeal; a 5’6” man would need $183,000 more; a 5’10” man would need $32,000 more."  ^ref-21830

So if divorce has an economic component, it logically follows that its precursor, marriage, must, too. But ask most young singles about the idea that there’s a socioeconomic underpinning to modern love, and they’re offended. They’ll insist that economics in mate selection is a thing of the past, a primitive relic from the days when there was little or no choice in whom you married or whether you married—like in an arranged marriage.

You’re not going to ‘find’ your soul mate. Anyone you meet already has soul mates. Dozens of them. Their mother. Their father. Their lifelong friends.

"Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist at Rutgers University who studies the physiology of romantic love, says it might be because romantic love is like a drug addiction. When she put forty-nine people who were madly in love in a functional MRI machine to see which parts of the brain were involved with these feelings, she found that when you feel that strong chemistry with someone, the brain system that becomes activated is the reward system, which is what also lights up when you reach for a piece of chocolate, or a cigarette, or an amphetamine. These cells near the base of the brain produce a substance called dopamine—and dopamine is what gives us that “high.” It doesn’t matter to your brain whether you’re craving a smoke or a lover—the result is the same: longing, obsession, need. When you’ve got all that dopamine floating around, she said, it’s hard to remember that the high only lasts, on average, from eighteen months to three years. Some people sustain it longer, she said, but even then, the quality of the high changes. “We just finished a study where we put people in the MRI machine who were still in love after twenty-one years of marriage,” she said. “We no longer found activity in a brain region associated with anxiety, and instead found activity in the area associated with calm and pain relief. You’re still attracted to the person, you still laugh at their jokes, but that early anxiety is now replaced with calm. If they don’t send you an e-mail, you don’t sit at the end of your bed and cry.” But if the expected pattern is that crazy early love anxiety leading to calm and security, Fisher says it can also go in the other direction. The calm and security you feel with a person can later trigger romantic love—something most people craving the immediate sparks forget. In fact, it happened to Fisher."  ^ref-40709

"Martie Haselton, a researcher who studies mate choice and sexuality at the University of California at Los Angeles, told me that what we think of as chemistry might be less about that romantic je ne says quoi and more about hormones. In her studies, she found that the kind of men women prefer changes depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle (how’s that for unromantic?). According to Haselton, women prefer more masculine men on high fertility days of the cycle but on other days, they’ll pick someone more on the feminine side of things. So while on high fertility days, they’re drawn to behavioral dominance and competitive traits in men, on other days of the cycle, they go for the nice guys. “What women want is everything,” she told me from her office at UCLA. “They want the guy who will be a good long-term partner in a relationship, someone kind, caring, a good provider. These are more feminine traits. But what women also want is a very sexy guy, very good-looking, tall, muscular—the bad boy traits. They don’t usually come in the same package. But it’s even more confusing, because they find they’re attracted to something a little bit different depending on where they are in their cycles.” Interestingly, if a woman is on the Pill, she won’t get these cyclical changes. But, Haselton added, “If she goes off the Pill, whoops.” Now she may view her nice-guy boyfriend or husband less favorably on high fertility days. These are the days when she thinks, “Something’s missing.”"  ^ref-63238

She told me that in her workshops with singles across the country, she’s noticed that the biggest impediment to going through the process is what she calls “pseudo high standards. “People hold back because of some issue,” she told me on the phone, “and they never get a real test of what it would be like to be in a committed relationship with that person. Single people would find someone more easily if everything wasn’t a test. When you adopt a spirit of goodwill toward something you don’t like in your partner, that leads to positive changes in your relationship. But many people break up instead. You should never settle for less than what you need, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to be everything on your checklist, because you can’t know what qualities you’ll be attracted to in a particular person.”"  ^ref-12405

"“People have a tendency to analyze far too much,” she said. “So many times we let our chatter in our brain talk us out of things that might be good for us. The converse is also true—if someone has a lot of things on your list, but your gut is telling you, ‘I don’t trust this person,’ that’s more important than the list.”"  ^ref-13889

"“In America,” she said, “when a potter makes a pot, they put a glaze on it and put it in the kiln and know exactly what it’s supposed to look like when it comes out. But when the Japanese make a pot, they put it in a wood-fire kiln that could be any temperature, and when they take the pot out, it’s not always exactly like they thought it was supposed to look like. And they say, ‘Oh, wow, this is what the fire did to the pot and it’s gorgeous!’ They believe that there’s no beauty in perfection. “So instead of knowing what the person across from you is supposed to be like, ask yourself the pot question, ‘But what is it, and is it beautiful?’ rather than thinking, ‘It’s not this and it should look like this.’ The question you have to ask is, ‘Do I like it?’ instead of ‘How does it compare to what I thought I wanted?’ People can surprise you.”"  ^ref-10284

"The Good Enough Marriage Now that I was truly focused on finding Mr. Good Enough, I came across something called “the good enough marriage.” It was a phrase coined by Paul Amato, the sociologist I’d spoken to at Penn State. Amato studies marriages like these—good marriages, but not perfect ones. And what he found reminded me of the way I’d been dating. Back in 1980, he and his colleagues developed a study of 2,000 married people. Every two years, the researchers followed up with these couples to find out how their marriages were going. They did this for twenty years. A lot of these couples divorced. So Amato wanted to know, what predicts divorce? “What we found seemed surprising at first,” he told me over the phone, “because we think of couples who get divorced as going through a long, terrible period of fighting. We think of them as estranged and so miserable that they decide the marriage can’t be salvaged.” This was true of some couples, but many didn’t follow that pattern at all. Up until the divorce, in fact, they seemed to be getting along pretty well. They weren’t ecstatically happy, but they weren’t unhappy. They frequently went out with their spouses and when asked, said they had very few marital problems or disagreements. On a scale from 1 to 10, they’d rate their marriages as 7s—not 2s or 3s. “Nothing serious was going on,” Amato said. “Their marriages weren’t perfect, but they were pretty good. Two years later, they were divorced. These couples were happy enough, but wanted something more.” When the couples in Amato’s study were asked why they got divorced, they’d say things like, “We were drifting apart—it’s not like when we first got married,” or “I didn’t really feel like I was growing as a person,” or “I thought my spouse was a nice person but not really my soul mate.” They were disappointed, but not angry. “They didn’t dislike their spouse,” Amato said. “Some people said, ‘You know, I still love my spouse, but I just realized we weren’t right for each other.’ Often they’d found someone else and they thought, ‘Now, this is my soul mate.’ Even though the marriage isn’t at all bad, they think they’ve found something better.”"  ^ref-13153

"relationship expert Diane Sollee’s SmartMarriages Web site: “Research has shown that every happy, successful couple has approximately ten areas of ‘incompatibility’ or disagreement that they will never resolve. Instead the successful couples learn how to manage the disagreements and live life ‘around’ them—to love in spite of their areas of difference… . If we switch partners, we’ll just get ten new areas of disagreement.”"  ^ref-29524

"Indeed, according to the Rutgers Marriage Project, research using a large national sample in the late 1980s found that of people who were unhappy in their marriages but stayed in them anyway, 86 percent indicated in interviews five years later that they were happier. In fact, three-fifths of the formerly unhappily married couples rated their marriages as either “very happy” or “quite happy.” “Most good enough marriages have the potential to become stronger and better with time, effort, and commitment,” Amato said. “I think the ‘soul mate’ concept has done a lot of harm because it sets the bar extremely high for a ‘successful’ marriage. Marriage is not about metaphysics.”"  ^ref-27011

"A SHIFT FROM “US” TO “ME” I asked Amato where this idea came from that the minute we feel less than completely fulfilled, we should seek something better. “My own thinking,” he said, “is that it comes from the 1970s. The human potential movement with Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow talking about how every facet of life should contribute to your personal growth. Maslow put self-actualization above having a good marriage in his hierarchy. So if you don’t like your friends, you find new ones. Same with a job. Same with marriage. In the 1960s, there were attitude surveys that involved university students. One study asked, What are the most important reasons for getting married? They said, I want to get married to raise a family, or so I can be economically secure, so I can have a nice home and a yard. And I want to be married to someone I love. But this part about love wasn’t the first thing they said. It was fourth or fifth. “But by the time you reach the 1970s and 80s,” he continued, “love is the most important reason for getting married, and the other reasons drop substantially on the list. This whole idea that love is the overriding reason for getting married is relatively new. We now see marriage based entirely on finding the perfect lover. My personal feeling is that you’ll be happier if you’re more realistic in your expectations of what you can actually get out of marriage.” In his book Alone Together, Amato and his cowriter talk about the difference between today’s marriages, which are more individualistic, and the pre-1970s marriages, which he calls “companionate marriages,” where you looked for a compatible and reliable partner to help you achieve mutual life goals. “Cooperative teamwork was the definition of a good marriage,” Amato said, “but now the focus has shifted to personal satisfaction through the marital relationship itself. Yes, he might be a good father and a good husband, but will he satisfy my deepest needs for romantic love and personal growth? The result has been a delay in the age at marriage, an increasing number of women who never marry, an increase in never-married mothers, and an increase in divorces for reasons having little to do with the spouse not being a supportive friend and cooperative teammate.” Choosing someone who is good enough, Amato said, is neither a personal defeat nor is it settling for less. “In most cases,” he said, “it is a reasonable and practical strategy for having a happy life over the long run.” I asked Amato about the studies I’d seen in the book The Case for Marriage: Why Married People Are Happier, Healthier, and Better Off Financially by Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher, which showed that one of the strongest hedges against depression—and against unhappiness more generally—is marriage. Did these findings apply only to great marriages, or did they also apply to “good enough” marriages? “Being in a dysfunctional, hostile marriage is definitely not good for a person’s sense of well-being,” he said. “But based on a variety of studies, most people in ‘good enough marriages’—nice person, works hard, will make a good parent—are happier than single people. Surveys show that the great majority of single people eventually want to be married, and people tend to be happiest when their lives are congruent with their goals. So single people who want to be married will usually get a boost in happiness when they become married, assuming they don’t make a big mistake and marry a psychopath.” In other words, a person doesn’t need a fairy tale marriage to achieve this happiness boost effect. Only a good enough one."  ^ref-31520

"Amato told me that both men and women have trouble accepting “good enough” partners, but in his work, he’s found that women generally have higher expectations than men. He and his colleagues studied unmarried adults in their twenties in same-sex focus groups, where they were asked questions like, “How do you know when you’ve found the right person?” With women, he said, the word “butterflies” came up again and again, but the guys didn’t use that word. “Guys would say, ‘I knew this person was the right person when we’d been dating for six months and she had to go away for a week, and when she was gone, I missed her so much. I thought that I felt happier when she was around. I realized how important she was.’ Women talked a lot about chemistry and fireworks.” With married people, Amato also found differences. “Women are more critical of relationships,” he said. “We interviewed husbands and wives and the husbands would say, ‘Well there’s this and sometimes there’s that,’ and wives would say, ‘Tell me where you want me to start!’ Men say, ‘This comes up, but it’s okay that we don’t agree on this one thing because it bothers me, but not that much.’ But his wife can’t let go of it. It might be because of the way girls’ socialization involves relationships. Women expect more of friendships, too. They expect self-disclosure and deep communication. Men are more easygoing about both relationships and friendships. They can watch a movie together and that’s fine.”"  ^ref-60296

"“So,” Haltzman told me, “I said, ‘Imagine meeting him at the sidelines at the kids’ soccer game, now that you’re divorced. Imagine his new girlfriend at his side. Imagine her looking at him with loving eyes and adoration.’ She said, ‘Okay, I could imagine that.’ So I asked, ‘Why would this woman be looking at him that way?’ and suddenly she listed all of her husband’s good qualities that she’d been overlooking. It’s a choice to look at that person with the same love in your eyes. We think our relationship is going to be perfect because our spouse will make it perfect, but two people are involved.” That’s why Amato suggests that people really look at why they’re thinking about breaking up or getting divorced."  ^ref-50239

"“You can ask a few questions and find out pretty quickly how someone feels about their partner,” he said. “ ‘I love him, but I’m not in love with him,’ is very different from, ‘He’s not a good spouse.’ ” In one of Amato’s studies, he looked at couples who now considered each other “good friends.” What was important over time, he found, was the ability to resolve conflict in an amicable way, general compatibility, and basic agreement on values and goals, like religion and children and how to raise children. “A lot comes down to more pragmatic things that keep the marriage going long-term,” he said. “This isn’t what a lot of single people find exciting. But if they want a long-term marriage, they need to start looking for the things that are going to be important in one.”"  ^ref-24865

"FEELING TOO COMFORTABLE Me: How important do you think sparks are in a marriage? Rabbi Wolpe: It’s interesting—a lot of people when they’re dating come to me and say, “I just want someone I can be myself with. Someone I’m completely comfortable with.” But the same thing that you want in marriage, people don’t like in dating. The same comfort and ease also translates into, “You’re too comfortable and easy with me. You don’t try!” So which is it—do you want exciting, or do you want comfortable? What do you want long-term? Me: What do you think matters most long-term? RW: The biggest predictor I’ve seen of whether a marriage will work has nothing to do with sparks, but how similar two people’s expectations are. If they have very different expectations in the marriage, or very different upbringings that they haven’t really worked through, it’s going to be a struggle. And I actually think that kindness, long-term, is the most useful—and overlooked—quality people should be looking for."  ^ref-53235

"Me: That’s interesting because the marital researchers I spoke to said that differences might seem cute in the beginning, but ultimately people who are temperamentally similar do better. So why do you think the differences work in your marriage? RW: We’re not together because of the differences—we’re together because of our similarities. There are deep similarities between my wife and me. We like and dislike the same people—almost a hundred percent of the time. We look at the world largely the same way, politically and religiously. The way we think about raising our daughter is very similar. So, I would say, though I may not have been aware of it at first, on the deep currents of life we were similar, and on the things that we weren’t similar about, we were moveable. The deep similarities overcame the surface differences and the differences didn’t matter nearly as much as we built a life together. She said, “I encourage you to do your world—are you comfortable going to those dinners by yourself?” And the truth is, it’s perfectly fine for me to go by myself because I’m busy being the rabbi anyway and I go around to the tables and so on, so we worked that out. Early on, I had this fixed idea of what a rabbi’s wife would be, and over the years it’s changed and become more flexible."  ^ref-58259

"many people, I think, have an inability to believe that other people work differently. We don’t realize that you have to learn someone in the way that you learn a subject. You can’t do it only by feeling. You actually have to listen to them and believe them when they tell you how they work. That’s a very counterintuitive thing to do because we all trust our instincts about people, but you really can be very wrong. Your instincts are based on people you know, and this person you’re getting to know is not your mother or your ex-girlfriends or your sister. So one of the things I tell young couples is that they need to be open to the fact that they will work differently from each other and from the families they grew up in, and that they have to respect that, and listen to that. In dating, people break up over these things and they miss the opportunity to really get to know the other person. They dismiss people without really understanding them—and then they wonder why they can’t meet anyone and why they’re still single."  ^ref-6227

"A DEEPER KIND OF ROMANCE Chris is very nurturing. He’s very sweet, and that’s the kind of thing that kept me with him during my confusion. I love to ski, and he learned to ski so we could do it together. He’s romantic, but in a completely different way than I was used to. With Chris, the simple day-to-day things are romantic, not the fast heart-racing things. He’ll say, “Let’s go look at the moon together,” and he’ll take my hand in his. I wake up and he’s got eggs ready for me and he buys the paper and everything is already there. I think, wow, that’s really thoughtful—and that lasts a lifetime. Not that you don’t need passion in your life, but I get that, too, just in a more subdued way. We went running together and he picked flowers and he put them in a vase in our room. He’s got a lot of feminine qualities that I used to look down on but that I’ve come to appreciate. And we have good sex. It’s not about how physically attractive I find him in comparison to my other boyfriends because the truth is, I’m never going to find him as attractive. But instead of focusing on aspects of him I’m not as attracted to, I think about how he’s got beautiful blue eyes and I focus on that."  ^ref-23509

"Kevin is the guy that John never was—the solid, stand-up guy who’s there for you. In building our household, he’s a full participant rather than a spectator. We share what’s going on, what we’re thinking, what we’re going through. We can disagree and talk about why. We always go in with the attitude that we can overcome this. Kevin’s very good at seeing where the other person is coming from. If we’re both too upset, we’ll say, “Let’s address it at another time when we can both be calm.” He has maturity without being patronizing and he’s involved without being clingy. It’s the right balance of everything."  ^ref-55146

"finding a good mate isn’t just some random external event—it’s based largely on our own choices and actions. The funny thing is, most of us aren’t single because of how we look or what we weigh, our level of education or job description, or whether we asked the guy out first or waited three days to return his call. We’re single because we have this underlying belief that we need to be completely in synch with our mates, and if we’re not, we should find someone else. And that makes it really hard to find anyone. As my married friend Lynn put it, “Adjusting one’s perspective actually makes the ‘hunt’ more interesting, manageable, entertaining, and less disappointing. When you adjust your standards—which doesn’t mean you have to ‘give a chance’ to a guy who completely repulses you—you, well, give more guys a chance. You meet more people, and allow yourself to be entertained and surprised.”"  ^ref-1847
