Comment: All brain related rather than hardware ?

"Medieval anatomists called women’s external genitals the “pudendum,” a word derived from the Latin pudere, meaning “to make ashamed.” Our genitalia were thus named “from the shamefacedness that is in women to have them seen.”1 Wait: what? The reasoning went like this: Women’s genitals are tucked away between their legs, as if they wanted to be hidden, whereas male genitals face forward, for all to see. And why would men’s and women’s genitals be different in this way? If you’re a medieval anatomist, steeped in a sexual ethic of purity, it’s because: shame. Now, if we assume “shame” isn’t really why women’s genitals are under the body—and I hope it’s eye-rollingly obvious that it’s not—why, biologically, are male genitals in front and female genitals underneath?"  ^ref-21368

"The hymen is another example of the wide variability in female genitals. Some women are born without hymens. Others have imperforate hymens (a thin but solid membrane covering all of the vaginal opening) or microperforate hymens (many tiny holes in an otherwise solid membrane). Some women have septate hymens, which feel like a strand of skin stretching across the mouth of the vagina. Some women’s hymens are durable, others are fragile. Some disappear early in adolescence, and some are still in evidence past menopause."  ^ref-14394

Comment: It's like nature threw stuff at a wall and kept whatever stuck. Maybe that's a metaphor for acceptance and undiscovered niche?

"Women’s hymens vary because, as far as science has been able to discover, the hymen was not selected for by evolution. It has no reproductive or any other function. It’s a byproduct, a little bonus left behind by the juggernaut of evolutionary selection pressure, like men’s nipples."  ^ref-24127

"I decided my first identity is ‘geek.’ Not woman, not Black: geek. Gamer. It took a long time to integrate the other parts of my identity, because I couldn’t see how they all fit together.

Comment: Need to belong

"If we embrace this simple, profound idea—all the same parts, organized in different ways—it answers that ever-popular question: Are men’s and women’s sexualities the same, or are they different? Answer: Yes. They’re made of the same parts, organized differently."  ^ref-38384

Comment: Where else does this concept apply?

"I realize that just saying, “Your genitals are perfect and beautiful,” won’t change anything if you feel uncomfortable with your genitals, but if seeing the beauty of your unique and healthy genitals is something you struggle with, there are two things I’d like you to do: 1. Get a hand mirror and look at your vulva, as I described earlier in the chapter. As you look, make note of all the things you like about what you see. Write them down. You’ll notice that your brain tries to list all the things you don’t like, but don’t include those. Do it again every week. Or twice a week. Or more. Each time, the things you like will become a little more salient and the noise will get a little quieter. Maybe even consider telling someone else about what you see and what you like. Better still, tell someone who also did the exercise! It’s an activity that gets labeled cognitive dissonance because it forces us to be aware of good things, when mostly we tend to be aware of the “negative” things. Try it. 2. Ask your partner, if you have one, to have a close look. Turn on the light, take off your clothes, get on your back, and let them look. Ask them what they see, how they feel about it, what memories they have of your vulva. Let your partner know what you’ve felt worried about, and ask for help to see what they see. Listen with your heart, not with your fear."  ^ref-4169

Comment: On body acceptance

---
"On the day you’re born, you’re given a little plot of rich and fertile soil, slightly different from everyone else’s. And right away, your family and your culture start to plant things and tend the garden for you, until you’re old enough to take over its care yourself. They plant language and attitudes and knowledge about love and safety and bodies and sex. And they teach you how to tend your garden, because as you transition through adolescence into adulthood, you’ll take on full responsibility for its care. And you didn’t choose any of that. You didn’t choose your plot of land, the seeds that were planted, or the way your garden was tended in the early years of your life. As you reach adolescence, you begin to take care of the garden on your own. And you may find that your family and culture have planted some beautiful, healthy things that are thriving in a well-tended garden. And you may notice some things you want to change. Maybe the strategies you were taught for cultivating the garden are inefficient, so you need to find different ways of taking care of it so that it will thrive (that’s in chapter 3). Maybe the seeds that were planted were not the kind of thing that will thrive in your particular garden, so you need to find something that’s a better fit for you (that’s in chapters 4 and 5). Some of us get lucky with our land and what gets planted. We have healthy and thriving gardens from the earliest moments of our awareness. And some of us get stuck with some pretty toxic crap in our gardens, and we’re left with the task of uprooting all the junk and replacing it with something healthier, something we choose for ourselves."  ^ref-4477

"Kaplan took the four-phase model out of the laboratory and adapted it to the lived experience of her clients. Her “triphasic” model of the sexual response cycle begins with desire, which she conceptualized as “interest in” or “appetite for” sex, much like hunger or thirst. The second phase is arousal, which combines excitement and plateau into one phase, and the third phase is orgasm."  ^ref-49643

"The Power of Context Erectile dysfunction drugs don’t improve women’s sexual functioning, but they do have one of the strongest placebo effects observed in medical research. Around 40 percent of participants in the placebo group of a clinical trial of sexual dysfunction medication report that the “drug”—actually a sugar pill—improved their sex lives; this is a response size so large that one particularly brilliant study reported only the effects of an eight-week “treatment” with a placebo.2 This is just one small hint at the power of context in shaping our sexual experience, which we’ll discuss in chapter 3."  ^ref-52256

"Your central nervous system (your brain and spinal cord) is made up of a series of partnerships of accelerator and brakes—like the pairing of your sympathetic nervous system (“accelerator”) and your parasympathetic nervous system (“brake”). The core insight of the dual control model is that what’s true for other aspects of the nervous system must also be true for the brain system that coordinates sex: a sexual accelerator and sexual brake. (Daniel Kahneman wrote of his own Nobel Prize–winning research in economics, “You know you have made a theoretical advance"  ^ref-32550

"The more I learned about the dual control model during my graduate education, the more I felt the lights come on in my understanding of human sexuality. I’ve been teaching it to my students for more than a decade now, and the more I teach it, the more I see how valuable it is in helping people to understand their own sexual functioning. Here’s how it works: Your central nervous system (your brain and spinal cord) is made up of a series of partnerships of accelerator and brakes—like the pairing of your sympathetic nervous system (“accelerator”) and your parasympathetic nervous system (“brake”). The core insight of the dual control model is that what’s true for other aspects of the nervous system must also be true for the brain system that coordinates sex: a sexual accelerator and sexual brake. (Daniel Kahneman wrote of his own Nobel Prize–winning research in economics, “You know you have made a theoretical advance when you can no longer reconstruct why you failed for so long to see the obvious.” So it was with Kahneman’s prospect theory, and so it is with the dual control model. I stand ready to send Erick and John large fruit baskets on the day the Nobel committee gets its act together and recognizes the importance of their insight.) So the dual control model of sexual response, as the name implies, consists of two parts: Sexual Excitation System (SES). This is the accelerator of your sexual response. It receives information about sexually relevant stimuli in the environment—things you see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or imagine—and sends signals from the brain to the genitals to tell them, “Turn on!” SES is constantly scanning your context (including your own thoughts and feelings) for things that are sexually relevant. It is always at work, far below the level of consciousness. You aren’t aware that it’s there until you find yourself turned on and pursuing sexual pleasure. Sexual Inhibition System (SIS). This is your sexual brake. “Inhibition” here doesn’t mean “shyness” but rather neurological “off” signals. Research has found that there are actually two brakes, reflecting the different functions of an inhibitory system. One brake works in much the same way as the accelerator. It notices all the potential threats in the environment—everything you see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or imagine—and sends signals saying, “Turn off!” It’s like the foot brake in a car, responding to stimuli in the moment. Just as the accelerator scans the environment for turn-ons, the brake scans for anything your brain interprets as a good reason not to be aroused right now—risk of STI transmission, unwanted pregnancy, social consequences, etc. And all day long it sends a steady stream of “Turn off!” messages. This brake is responsible for preventing us from getting inappropriately aroused in the middle of a business meeting or at dinner with our family. It’s also the system that throws the Off switch if, say, in the middle of some nookie, your grandmother walks in the room. The second brake is a little different. It’s more like the hand brake in a car, a chronic, low-level “No thank you” signal. If you try to drive with the hand brake on, you might be able to get where you want to go, but it’ll take longer and use a lot more gas. Where the foot brake is associated with “fear of performance consequences,” the hand brake is associated with “fear of performance failure,” like worry about not having an orgasm."  ^ref-9819

Comment: Lots to unpack . Parallel theory, explaining the dual model

---
"conceptualize all sexual functioning—and all sexual dysfunction—as a balance (or imbalance) between brakes and accelerator. If you’re having trouble with any phase of sexual response, is it because there’s not enough stimulation to the accelerator? Or is there too much stimulation to the brakes? Indeed, a common mistake made by people who are struggling with orgasm or desire is assuming that the problem is lack of accelerator; it’s more likely that the problem is too much brake (more on that in chapters 7 and 8). And once you know whether it’s a problem with the accelerator or the brakes, you can figure out how to create change."  ^ref-10658

* Come as You Are by Emily
Nagoski

---
"The sensitive accelerator plus not-so-sensitive brakes combination describes between 2 and 6 percent of women,4 and it’s associated with sexual risk taking and compulsivity. Because the brain mechanism responsible for noticing sexually relevant stimuli is very sensitive, you’re highly motivated to pursue sex, and because the brain mechanism responsible for stopping you from doing things you know you shouldn’t do is only minimally functional, you may sometimes feel out of control of your sexuality, especially when you’re stressed. You’re likely to have more partners, use less protection, and feel less in control. You might also be more likely to want sex when you are stressed (“redliners”), whereas other women are likely to find that their interest in sex plummets when they’re stressed (“flatliners”)."  ^ref-37970
* Come as You Are by Emily
Nagoski

---
"A sensitive brake, regardless of the accelerator, is the strongest predictor of sexual problems of all kinds. In a 2008 survey of 226 women age eighteen to eighty-one, low interest in sex, arousal difficulties, and orgasm difficulty, were significantly correlated with inhibition factors, especially “arousal contingency” (“Unless things are ‘just right’ it is difficult for me to become sexually aroused”) and concerns about sexual function (“If I am worried about taking too long to become aroused or to orgasm, this can interfere with my arousal”)."  ^ref-26959
* Come as You Are by Emily
Nagoski

---
"Recall, especially, that there are actually two different brakes—some people’s arousal is shut down more because of internal fears (e.g., taking too long to become aroused) and others are more affected by fears about external factors (e.g., getting an STI or getting caught having sex). Both can decrease your arousal, or prevent you from becoming aroused in the first place."  ^ref-14296
* Come as You Are by Emily
Nagoski

---
"A more important difference than simply the sensitivity of the accelerators and brakes of men and women is the relationships of these two mechanisms with other aspects of men’s and women’s psychologies—especially mood and anxiety. For example, about 10 to 20 percent of both men and women report an increase in their sexual interest when they’re anxious or depressed.8 But a guy who wants sex more when he’s anxious or depressed probably has less sensitive brakes. In contrast, a woman who wants sex more when she’s anxious or depressed is likely to have a more sensitive accelerator. What this shows us is that there’s more than just a population-level difference in the average sensitivities of SIS and SES between men and women; there also seem to be a difference in how these two systems relate to the other motivational systems in the brain, particularly the stress response system."  ^ref-41226

"Similarly, you learn the sexual language you’re surrounded by. Just as there are no innate words, there appear to be almost no innate sexual stimuli. What turns us on (or off) is learned from culture, in much the same way children learn vocabulary and accents from culture."  ^ref-34757

"In the same way, girls learn what’s sexually relevant not because their genitals do something so obvious and new that they can’t help learning from it, but rather by paying attention to their environment, especially to the other person there with them in the sexually relevant situation. When I say “learn,” I don’t mean explicit learning, like how you learn all the state capitals or the Pythagorean theorem. I mean it in the way those rats learned about lemons and jackets, the way Pavlov’s dogs learned to salivate when a bell rang, or the way you learned to ride a bicycle. None of these can be learned from a book but only from experience. And this is another way that it’s different for girls: Hormones influence the functioning of this learning mechanism. Your brain’s readiness to link external cues to internal arousal processes is different at different stages of the menstrual cycle, whereas it’s more stable in men, who don’t have the monthly oscillation of their hormones."  ^ref-50305

Comment: Environmental context affecting internal development

---
"girls’ learning about sexually relevant stimuli is • likely to begin later in their development • more influenced than boys’ by social and emotional context • more likely to generate a mismatch between their genital response and their experience of sexual arousal (as I’ll describe in chapter 6)"  ^ref-54013

"First, SIS and SES are traits you’re born with that remain more or less stable over your life span, and no one knows precisely which factors cause them to change. In general, though, changing your SIS and SES is probably a bit like changing your IQ: You’re born with a range of potential, and as you develop, your life experience shapes that potential and lands you somewhere within that range. SIS and SES are way more flexible than IQ, but we know very little about what factors are involved in changing them, whether they can be changed deliberately, or if they respond only to changes in environmental factors beyond our control. But so far, it seems there’s very little we can do to deliberately change SIS or SES."  ^ref-25733
* Come as You Are by Emily
Nagoski

---
"But then there’s the second part of the answer: You may not be able to change the mechanism itself, but you probably can change what the mechanism responds to. You can often change what your brake considers a potential threat, and you can certainly reduce those threats, like unwanted pregnancy, STIs, stress, etc. You also can change what your accelerator considers sexually relevant, and you can increase the sexually relevant things in your life. In other words, you can change the context—your external circumstances and your internal state."  ^ref-51133

"“cues for sexual desire factors,” Katie McCall and Cindy Meston asked women what turned them on, and found that the results divided into four general categories.2 Love/Emotional Bonding Cues, such as feeling a sense of love, security, commitment, emotional closeness, protection, and support in your relationship, and feeling a kind of “special attention” from your partner. Example: A woman told me the extraordinarily romantic story of a boyfriend who flew halfway around the globe to surprise her for their second anniversary of dating. Talk about closeness, commitment, and special attention. Yeah, that man got laid. Explicit/Erotic Cues, such as watching a sexy movie, reading an erotic story, watching or hearing other people having sex, anticipating having sex, knowing your partner desires you, or noticing your own or your partner’s arousal. Example: A woman in her twenties told me of a time when she woke up in the middle of the night in her boyfriend’s apartment, to the sound of the upstairs neighbors having sex. The rhythmic squeaking and grunting sighs instantly turned her on. She kissed her boyfriend awake and they listened together, then had fast, intense sex. Visual/Proximity Cues, such as seeing an attractive, well-dressed potential partner, with a well-toned body and lots of confidence, intelligence, and class. Example: A friend once said to me rhetorically, “What is it about the white cuffs of a shirt peeking out under a suit jacket?” I suggested, “Maybe a marker of a social status?” And she added, “That, and grooming. A man with pristine white cuffs is a man whose skin will taste good.” Romantic/Implicit Cues include intimate behaviors such as dancing closely, sharing a hot tub or massages or other intimate touch (like touching the face or hair), watching a sunset, laughing or whispering together, or smelling pleasant. Example: A woman in her thirties told me that she and her husband were saving up to remodel their bathroom, after they realized that a reason she was so keen for sex when they went on vacation was that they took long, hot (in every sense) baths together in the giant tubs at the B and Bs where they stayed. More baths, more sex."  ^ref-22726

"things that cause them to turn on or to “keep the brakes on.”3 These researchers found themes that have interesting parallels with McCall and Meston’s work. Here are the themes, with a quote from the research participants to illustrate each: • Feelings About One’s Body. “It’s much easier for me to feel aroused when I’m feeling really comfortable with myself . . . it’s not as easy to feel aroused when I’m not feeling good about myself and my body.” • Concerns About Reputation. “Being single and you know, wanting to be sexual with another person and thinking ‘okay, am I going to be too much?’ or ‘am I going to be not enough?’ or ‘what are they going to think of me because I’m doing these things?’ . . .” • Putting on the Brakes. “I think it’s like you might have some inclinations and then you’re like, ‘wait a minute, you can’t do that,’ you’re in a relationship or that guy’s a loser . . . and all of a sudden you just [think] ‘okay, fine, forget it, I can’t. That’s a bad idea,’ and just walk away from it.” • Unwanted Pregnancy/Contraception. “Unwanted pregnancy is a big turn off and if you’re with a partner who seems unconcerned about that, then it really feels like a danger.” • Feeling Desired Versus Feeling Used by Partner. “I like it when [men] caress not only, like, your body parts that get sexually aroused but just, like, your arms . . . it feels like he’s encompassing you and appreciating your whole body.” • Feeling “Accepted” by Partner. “Even with my second husband, and we were together 16 years, he was not accepting of my sexual responses . . . I make a lot of noise or [with] my favorite way to orgasm, he felt left out . . . That was just the beginning of just really shutting down.” • Style of Approach/Initiation and Timing. “His ‘game’ . . . you know, how the man approached you, how did he get me to talk to him longer than like, five minutes? . . . [It’s] the ways he went about it.” • Negative Mood. “If you’re very upset with your intended sexual partner, if you’re very upset with him about something, there’s no way that you are going to be aroused.”"  ^ref-51775

"Context is made of two things: the circumstances of the present moment—whom you’re with, where you are, whether the situation is novel or familiar, risky or safe, etc.—and your brain state in the present moment—whether you’re relaxed or stressed, trusting or not, loving or not, right now, in this moment. The evidence is mounting that women’s sexual response is more sensitive than men’s to context, including mood and relationship factors, and women vary more from each other in how much such factors influence their sexual response.6"  ^ref-62259

When you think about the great sex we had on that anniversary, what did it feel like?” She thought about it for a minute. And then she burst into tears. She began talking about how much she loved him, how she relied on him for her sanity in a life that seemed specifically designed to make her crazy, how she wanted to show him, not just tell him, how important he is to her, but every time she considered initiating sex, she just felt swamped and overwhelmed and her body shut down on her. Undifferentiated grief flowed from her as she talked—grief for her lost sexuality, but also for her lost peace of mind, her lost sense of self, independent of her roles as mother, daughter, wife, boss, employee, student . . ."  ^ref-19160

"Painful or Erotic? If your partner spanks your butt while you’re in the middle of tying your toddler’s shoes, it’s annoying. But if your partner spanks your butt in the middle of sex, it can feel very, very sexy indeed. Context can cause sensations that are typically perceived as painful, like spanking or whipping, to be erotic. Sexual “submission” requires relaxing into trust—turning off the offs—and allowing your partner to take control. In this explicitly erotic, highly trusting, and consensual context, your brain is open and receptive, ready to interpret any and all sensations as erotic. And in a culture where women have to spend so much time with the brakes on, saying no, it’s no wonder we have fantasies about abandoning all control, relaxing into absolute trust (turning off the brakes) and allowing ourselves to experience sensation."  ^ref-24573

If you can’t breathe, then it doesn’t matter how long it’s been since you’ve eaten, you will not feel hungry. And if you’re generally overwhelmed by twenty-first-century life, practically everything else takes priority over sex; as far as your brain is concerned everything is a charging lion.

"Here are some other things that science says can genuinely help us not only “feel better” but actually facilitate the completion of the stress response cycle: sleep; affection (more on that in the next section); any form of meditation, including mindfulness, yoga, tai chi, body scans, etc. (more on that in chapter 9); and allowing yourself a good old cry or primal scream—though you have to be careful with this one. Sometimes people just wallow in their stress when they cry, rather than allowing the tears to wash away the stress. If you’ve ever locked yourself in your room and sobbed for ten minutes, and then at the end heaved a great big sigh and felt tremendously relieved, you’ve felt how it can move you from “I am at risk” to “I am safe.” Art, used in the same way, can help. When mental health professionals suggest journaling or other expressive self-care, they don’t mean that the construction of sentences or the task of drawing is inherently therapeutic; rather, they’re encouraging you to find positive contexts to discharge your stress, through the creative process. I’m inclined to add grooming and other body self-care to the list. Though I’m not familiar with any specific research on it, I’ve talked with lots of women for whom showering and the rituals, part social, part meditative, of painting their nails or doing their hair or putting on makeup—generally “getting ready” to go out (or stay in)—fully transition them from a stressed-out state of mind to a warm, social state of mind."  ^ref-11004

So what Isabel “wanted,” to answer Bergner’s titular question, was proximity with her attachment object, in the face of separation anxiety. The hormones dopamine and oxytocin were having their wicked way with her eagerness system, pushing her toward the attachment object who would never commit to her and who therefore chronically activated her attachment system’s need for safe haven.20 This is the dark side of pairing stress and attachment: the “I am lost” feeling, which motivates us to stabilize our connection with our attachment object—“I am home.” Therapist and author Sue Johnson calls this “solace sex,” sex that’s motivated by your desire to prove that you are loved."  ^ref-63757

"The first good news is that sex you crave often isn’t sex that feels good—remember, enjoying and eagerness are not the same thing. Sue Johnson describes this “solace sex” as “soothing but unerotic,” in contrast to “sealed-off sex,” which is “erotic but empty.”23 Solace sex can feel like a relief, because you’re easing fear. But let’s not mistake relief for pleasure."  ^ref-477

"Kids who are securely attached to their adult caregivers will, as adults, most likely attach securely to their romantic partners, and kids who are insecurely attached to their adult caregivers will, as adults, mostly likely attach insecurely to their romantic partners. But if parents are under extreme stress or have lots of other children to take care of or have an active drug or alcohol addiction or mood or personality disorder, they won’t necessarily be present, physically or emotionally, when the child needs them. When our adult caregivers are less reliable, we attach insecurely."  ^ref-27450

"Sex to advance the plot in unstable relationships is like that. It doesn’t feel good when you experience fear and instability in your relationship, just as it doesn’t feel good to have to pee really badly. It just feels like a relief when you can finally do something about it. And don’t we want our relationships and our sex lives to be about more than just . . . relief? So the good news is that if you’re missing this kind of intense craving for sex in your relationship, it’s no loss. The bad news is that, yes, most of us will find it easier to crave sex, for what that’s worth, when our relationships are unstable—either new or threatened. But the second good news is that there’s a bunch of spectacular research on what people can do to increase their craving and pleasure (eagerness and enjoying) with sex in a stable, happy relationship."  ^ref-56721

"We can think of insecure attachment as fitting into two different strategies: anxious and avoidant. With an anxious attachment style, you cope with the risk that your attachment object might abandon you by clinging desperately to them. Anxiously attached children get jealous and experience intense separation distress; so do anxiously attached adults. People with an avoidant attachment style cope with the risk that their attachment object might abandon them by not attaching seriously to any specific individual. Avoidant children don’t prefer their parents to other adults; avoidant adults, according to the research, are more likely to approve of and have anonymous sex. About half of people in the United States develop secure attachment styles, and half develop insecure styles."  ^ref-28221

Comment: Summary

---
"A 2012 review of the research on the relationship between sex and attachment found that secure attachment was associated with every domain of sexual wellbeing you can imagine. Secure attachers have more positive emotions during sex, more frequent sex, higher levels of arousal and orgasm, and better communication about sex.27 They are better at giving and receiving consent and are more likely to engage in safer sex practices such as contraception use; they enjoy sex more, are more attentive to their partners’ needs, feel a link between sex and love, are more likely to have sex in the context of a committed relationship, and are more sexually self-confident. Secure attachers have the healthiest, most pleasurable sex lives. People with anxious attachment styles are the most likely to engage in anxiety-driven “solace sex”—that is, using sex as an attachment behavior—which can make sex intense without making it pleasurable. Anxious attachers worry more about sex, and yet they also equate the quality of sex with the quality of a relationship. They’re more likely to experience pain with sex, particularly in low-intimacy relationships. They’re less likely to use condoms, more likely to use alcohol or other drugs before sex and, unsurprisingly, have higher rates of STIs and unwanted pregnancy. Anxious attachers experience more pain, anxiety, and health risks. People with insecure attachment styles, anxious or avoidant, are more likely to be involved on either side of a coercive sexual relationship. People with avoidant attachment start having sex later in life, have sex less often, with fewer noncoital behaviors. They have more positive attitudes toward sex outside committed relationships, have more one-night stands, and are more likely to have sex just to fit into a social expectation rather than because they really want to. Avoidant attachers experience sex as less connected with their lives and their relationships."  ^ref-28176

Comment: Tool and alias for emotional regulation along with mindfulness

---
"There are some basic rules you have to follow in order to stay over your emotional center of gravity: Your feelings are neither more nor less important than your partner’s. Your pain doesn’t automatically make your experience more valid, nor does your partner’s pain make your partner’s experience more valid. When we are in emotional pain, we tend to prioritize easing that pain over respecting our partner’s experience, so we have to remind ourselves that our different experiences matter equally. Each of you is 100 percent responsible for your own feelings. Partners in healthy relationships choose to help each other with their feelings, but it is always a choice. We “turn toward” our partner’s needs, as relationship researcher John Gottman puts it, and when our partner supports us, we express our gratitude for that choice. There are four basic steps to the process: 1. Name the Feeling. “Right now I feel . . . jealous/angry/hurt/etc.” Simple, though there are usually multiple feelings involved at the same time. That’s normal. 2. Welcome the Feeling. Don’t run away from it, don’t judge it or shame it or get mad at it. Sit still with it, like a welcome guest. 3. Take Responsibility for the Feeling. If you feel fear or anger, how could the perceived threat be managed? If you feel sadness, hurt, or grief, how can you heal the loss? The question to ask yourself as you take responsibility for your feelings is: What will help? There won’t always be something you can actively do, apart from allowing the feeling to discharge and complete its cycle. And remember that it’s not your partner’s fault or obligation; their help is entirely voluntary and provides an opportunity for you to express gratitude for the support. 4. Communicate the Feeling and the Need. At last, the easiest part. “I feel x,” you say, “and I think what would help is y.” For example, “I feel threatened by the time you spend with your coworker, and I could use some kind of plan that will give me reassurance.” Or, “I still have this hurt about that time you did x, and what I need is some time to go through that emotional tunnel so I can get to the light at the end.”"  ^ref-34440

You can’t choose for your broken heart not to hurt, any more than you can choose for a broken bone not to hurt. But you can recognize the pain as part of the healing, and you can trust your heart to heal, just as you trust your bones to heal, knowing that it will gradually hurt less and less as you recover."  ^ref-32804

"As you progress through these biological processes, your mental state changes, and that, in turn, changes whether and how your brain responds to contexts as sexually relevant or to sensations as sexually pleasurable. Stress hits the brake for about 80 percent of people, but it activates the accelerator for others—people vary. But for everyone, stress changes the context in which you experience sexual response, which changes your perception of sexual sensations.

Practicing mindfulness is an evidence-based strategy for decoupling the brakes and accelerator. • In the right context, sex can attach us emotionally to new partners or reinforce emotional bonds in unstable relationships. In other words, sex and love are closely linked in our brains—but only in the right context. • Sex that brings you closer to your partner “advances the plot,” as opposed to gratuitous sex, for no reason other than that you can.

"Let’s return to the garden metaphor: You’re born with a little plot of rich and fertile soil, unique to yourself. Your brain and body are the soil of this garden, and individual differences in your SIS and SES are important characteristics of your innate garden, which is made of the same parts as everyone else’s, but organized in a unique way. Your family and your culture plant the seeds and tend the garden, and they teach you how to tend it. They plant the seeds of language and attitudes and knowledge and habits about love and safety and bodies and sex. And gradually, as you move into adolescence, you take on responsibility for tending your own garden. As you begin to tend the garden yourself, you may find that your family and your culture have planted some beautiful, nourishing things. You may also find that your family and culture have planted some pretty toxic crap in your garden. And everyone—even those whose families planted pretty good stuff—will have to deal with the invasive weeds of a sex-negative culture full of body shaming and sex stigma. These travel not in the seeds planted by families but underground via their roots, like poison ivy, under fences and over walls, from garden to garden. No one chose that they be there, but there they are nonetheless. So if you want to have a healthy garden, a garden you choose, you have to go row by row and figure out what you want to keep and nurture . . . and what you want to dig out and replace with something healthier."  ^ref-3153

"Women have been trained to beat ourselves up when we fall short. We criticize ourselves—“I’m so stupid/fat/crazy,” “I suck,” “I’m a loser”—as a reflex when things don’t go the way we want them to. And our brains process self-criticism with brain areas linked to behavioral inhibition—brakes.7 So it’s not surprising that self-criticism is directly related to depression8—and does depression improve your sexual well-being? It does not. Here’s how that works: When you get right down to it, self-criticism is yet another form of stress.9 I described stress in chapter 4 as an evolutionarily adaptive mechanism to help us escape threats—“I am at risk.” When we think, “I am an inadequate person!” that’s like saying, “I am the lion!” Literally, our stress hormone levels increase.10 Your body reacts to negative self-evaluations as if you’re under attack.

We think to ourselves: “If I stop beating myself up, I’ll get complacent and lazy, and then I’ll never change!” And then we cling to our self-judgments even more tightly—after all, these are moral issues, involving whether you are a good, decent, worthy person or a bad, disgusting, worthless person. We think: “To accept myself as I am would be to accept that I am a flawed, bad, broken person, and to abandon all hope that I could one day be better, that I could one day deserve love.”"  ^ref-3724

"In her book Self-Compassion: Stop Beating Yourself Up and Leave Insecurity Behind, researcher and educator Kristin Neff describes self-compassion’s three key elements: • Self-kindness is our ability to treat ourselves gently and with caring. On the Self Compassion Scale (SCS), a survey used to assess self-compassion, self-kindness is described with items like “When I’m going through a very hard time, I give myself the caring and tenderness I need.” In contrast, its opposite, self-judgment, is assessed with “I’m intolerant and impatient towards those aspects of my personality I don’t like.” • Common humanity is viewing our suffering as something that connects us with others, rather than separates us. It’s assessed on the SCS with items like “When I feel inadequate in some way, I try to remind myself that feelings of inadequacy are shared by most people.” Its opposite, isolation, is assessed with “When I fail at something that’s important to me, I tend to feel alone in my failure.” • Mindfulness is being nonjudgmental about whatever is happening in the present moment. I talked about mindfulness in chapter 4, and I’ll be talking about it again in chapter 9. Mindfulness is important. On the SCS it’s assessed with items like “When something painful happens I try to take a balanced view of the situation.” Its opposite is over-identification, as in over-identifying with your own failures and suffering, holding fast to the pain and being unable to let it go. It’s assessed with items like “When I’m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that’s wrong.” Self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification turn you into your own lion, being your own threat—“I am at risk.” And they’re normal—we all experience them. Self-compassion doesn’t mean never feeling them, it means being kind to yourself when you do."  ^ref-64995

"Self-compassion is emphatically not self-esteem. Self-esteem is about self-evaluation, your perceived value as a human being, which is often contingent upon your sense of personal success in comparison with others. Self-compassion, by contrast, is unconditional and nonevaluative. We can have self-compassion when we’re doing well and when we’re struggling—because life has treated us harshly or because we made a mistake.23"  ^ref-31067

"Self-compassion is being patient with yourself through that process—and being patient with yourself when you need to take a break.

Be sure to include the self-critical thoughts you’re battering yourself with. 2. Then write the name of a good friend at the top of the page and imagine that that person is describing this problem. Imagine that she’s asking for your help, and write down what you would tell her. Imagine that you’re in your best, most empathic, calmest, most supportive state of mind, and tell her all the things she needs to hear. 3. Now reread what you wrote. It’s for you.

"Remind yourself that the day you were born, your body was a cause for celebration, for love without condition, and that’s just as true today as it was then. Let these self-critical thoughts go, let the judgments go, and notice only the things you like. Do this over and over again—every day if you can. It will be hard at first, and there will be lots of complicated and conflicting emotions. It will be noisy in your head. Even now, as you consider doing it, you might be noticing a lot of, “But Emily!” noise in your head. It’s okay. As I’ll describe in chapter 9, there is an inevitable grieving process involved in letting go of old ideas about your body. It will hurt the way your hands ache when you come in from the cold—gradually they get warmer and then they feel great.

You don’t need to be trained in media literacy and all the ways that you’re being manipulated with digital alteration of images in order to know when something is making you feel better or worse about yourself. And if it makes you feel worse, evidence suggests that it’s interfering with your sexual wellbeing—even if you’ve been taught to believe that feeling worse about your body “motivates” you to “improve” your body. That’s a psychological trap you never need to be caught in again. Stop watering the weeds.

"tl;dr • We all grew up hearing contradictory messages about sex, and so now many of us experience ambivalence about it. That’s normal. The more aware you are of those contradictory messages, the more choice you have about whether to believe them. • Sometimes people resist letting go of self-criticism—“I suck!”—because it can feel like giving up hope that you could become a better person, but that’s the opposite of how it works. How it really works is that when you stop beating yourself up, you begin to heal, and then you grow like never before. • For real: Your health is not predicted by your weight. You can be healthy—and beautiful—no matter your size. And when you enjoy living in your body today, and treat yourself with kindness and compassion, your sex life gets better. • Sexual disgust hits the brakes. This response is learned, not innate, and can be unlearned. Begin to notice your “yuck” responses and ask yourself if those responses are making your sex life better or worse. Consider letting go of the yucks that are interfering with your sexual pleasure—see chapter 9 to learn how."  ^ref-5986

"Genital response is specific to sexually relevant stimuli—regardless of whether those stimuli are sexually appealing. The genitals tell you, “That’s sexually relevant.” The person tells you, “That turns me on,” or “I am enjoying this,” or “I am eager for more, please.” For women, there’s about a 10 percent overlap between “sexually relevant” and “sexually appealing.” For men, there’s about a 50 percent overlap. What we’re seeing in nonconcordance is the difference between expecting and enjoying, from chapter 3. Genital response is the automatic, trained response to something that’s sexually relevant. Pavlov’s dogs salivated when a bell rang, not because they wanted to eat the bell but because their expecting system had linked the bell with food. Similarly, your emotional One Ring has learned what’s sexually relevant (remember babies Frankie and Frannie in chapter 2, and the rats in jackets?), and your expecting system activates physiological responses to whatever it has learned is sexually relevant. A stimulus can be sexually relevant and yet be sexually unappealing,"  ^ref-25271

"For example, suppose I show you a picture of an emotionally intense scenario—maybe the face of a viciously snarling dog, or a wounded child sitting alone—and it causes you to experience an emotion, a physiological response. And then I ask you to say a fact about the scenario or else to say how the picture makes you feel. Which of those, saying the fact or saying the feeling, will reduce your physiological response? When researchers did this experiment, people reported that saying a fact about an emotional situation helped to reduce the emotion, more than saying the feeling they were experiencing—and the tension in their voice reflected that.9 But their skin conductance (a reliable measure of the stress response) went down when they named the feeling, not when they named a fact. That is, their physiological stress response was nonconcordant with their experienced emotion. Normal. Ross Buck, professor of communication sciences at the University of Connecticut, has a handy way of thinking about emotion that will help us to understand nonconcordance.10 He describes three levels of emotion: Emotion I is the involuntary physiological response—your heart rate and blood pressure, pupil dilation, digestion, sweating, immune functioning. Genital response falls into this category, and my college friend who got wet while she was bored, tied up waiting for her partner to come back, experienced this kind of response . . . but nothing else. Emotion II is involuntary expressive response to a feeling. It’s body language—or, more accurately, “paralanguage”—things like vocal inflection, posture, and facial expression—all the cues we use to infer another person’s internal state. A great dinner date will be full of Emotion II, as you find yourself putting your hand on your date’s arm, gazing into their eyes, and smiling. These are often influenced by culture, but have a great deal of universality, and they can be intentionally controlled to some degree, but not as much as you might think. Did you choose the expression on your face right now? Emotion III is your subjective experience of a feeling. If someone asks you how you feel and you check in with yourself to find the answer, what you’re noticing is Emotion III. This is subjective arousal—the conscious experience of “I want you so much I can hardly stand it”—which may or may not be accompanied by genital response (Emotion I) or eye contact (Emotion II). It might even be true that there are stable gender differences in nonconcordance between physiological response and subjective experience for emotions other than sexual arousal.11 For whatever reason—cultural, biological, or both (probably both)—women have more overlap between their facial expressions (Emotion II) and their subjective experience (Emotion III), while men have more overlap between their skin conductance (Emotion I) and their subjective experience (Emotion III).12 What this research suggests is that a woman’s emotional experience is more likely to line up with her facial expression and her vocal inflection, while a man’s emotional experience is more likely to line up with his heart rate and blood flow."  ^ref-19390

"So here are some alternative things your partner can pay attention to, if your vagina is telling only about expecting, not about enjoying: • Your breath. Your respiration rate and your pulse increase with arousal. You begin holding your breath, too, as you get to the highest level of arousal and your thoracic and pelvic diaphragms contract. • Muscle tension, especially in your abdomen, buttocks, and thighs, but also in your wrists, calves, and feet. When the tension moves in waves through you, your body bows and arches. For some women, in some contexts, this happens in an obvious way. For other women, or in other contexts, it is subtle. It’s a cue. • Most important, your words. Only you can tell your partner what you want and how you feel. Not all women feel equally comfortable talking about their desire and arousal, but you can shortcut with “yes” or “more” or “blrgpfh!” And remember this, too: It’s not about attending to any specific physiological response, behavior, or other clue.

"Arousal comes first—before desire, that is. Like this: Genital response happens when your brain notices a sexually relevant stimulus—“This is a restaurant.” Arousal happens when your brain is in the right, sex-positive context—when your brain is open to the idea of going to a restaurant. Desire comes along when your brain shifts from being open to the idea to actively wanting to go. And it’s the subject of chapter 7. tl;dr • There’s a 50 percent overlap between blood flow to a male’s genitals and how turned on he feels. There’s a 10 percent overlap between blood flow to a woman’s genitals and how turned on she feels. • The reason for the difference is that sexually relevant (expecting) is not the same thing as sexually appealing (enjoying). In men there’s a lot of overlap between the two, most of the time; in women the overlap is more context dependent. • This difference between women and men doesn’t mean women are broken; it means they’re women. • The best way to tell if a woman is aroused is not to notice what her genitals are doing but to listen to her words."  ^ref-13007

"A drive is a biological mechanism whose job is to keep the organism at a healthy baseline—not too warm, not too cold, not too hungry, not too full. A traditional metaphor for a drive system is a thermostat: When the temperature drops below a critical point, the thermostat notices and switches on the heat, and then when the temperature gets back in the desired range, the heat switches off. The temperature bounces around within a few degrees of the set point. Appetite is the classic example of a drive. Hunger for food drives foraging and eating, and then when you feel full, you stop eating. There are lots of other drives: Thirst drives fluid consumption, fatigue drives sleep, thermoregulation drives shivering, sweating, taking off a sweater, or turning up the thermostat. Hunger and thirst are motivational systems that push you to do the things you have to do in order to avoid dying. The uncomfortable (“aversive”) internal states of thirst, exhaustion, and cold push you out into the world, to go meet a need, so that you can return to a baseline, and that baseline is all about staying alive. When you hear “drive,” think “survive.”"  ^ref-21232

Comment: And not a drive

"Most people associate the word “incentive” with the idea of a prize, something worth working for. The biological meaning is similar. Instead of feeling pushed by an uncomfortable internal experience, like hunger, incentive motivation systems are all about being pulled by an attractive external stimulus. When you hear “incentive motivation,” think “thrive.” Drive survive. Pushed by an unpleasant internal state, which ends when you return to baseline. Incentive thrive. Pulled by an attractive external stimulus (the incentive). It ends when you’ve obtained the incentive. In a lot of systems, such as food appetite, both mechanisms are at work, which is why we can want delicious food even when we’re not at all hungry. But sex is not a drive."  ^ref-7522

"So the little monitor keeps track of how much progress you’re making in relation to how much effort you’re investing. She tallies your effort-to-progress ratio, and she has a strong opinion about what that ratio should be. This opinion is called “criterion velocity.”16 And this is where it gets really interesting. When the monitor feels that you’re making good progress—when you’re matching or exceeding the criterion velocity—she is satisfied, motivated, eager. But when the monitor feels that you’re not making enough progress, she begins to become frustrated, and she prompts you to increase your efforts to get closer to your goal. If you still aren’t making enough progress to satisfy the little monitor, she begins to get angry . . . and then enraged! And eventually, if you continue to fall short, at a certain point the little monitor gives up and pushes you off an emotional cliff into the “pit of despair,” as the monitor becomes convinced that the goal is unattainable.

"There are all kinds of novelty and ambiguity to investigate in the world, and the monitor has only a limited amount of attention, so she has to prioritize what domains of life to pay attention to, and these domains rank themselves in order of life importance.18 Sexual arousal draws the monitor’s focus toward sex, prioritizes sex, only when there aren’t other, more important things for her to concentrate on, such as survival. And again, stress is a survival response—escape the lion!—so it deprioritizes sex for most people.

Comment: Look to this section and next pages to summarize

"In Mating in Captivity, Esther Perel presents a contradiction at the core of modern relationships: the antithetical pull between the familiar versus the novel, the stable versus the mysterious. We want love, which is about security and safety and stability, but we also want passion, which is about adventure and risk and novelty. Love is having. Desire is wanting. And you can want only what you don’t already have. If the problem is that long-term love is antithetical to long-term passion, then the solution, says Perel, is to maintain autonomy, a space of eroticism inside yourself, as a way to maintain the distance necessary to allow wanting to emerge. In terms of that little monitor in your brain, the solution is to sustain just a little bit of dissatisfaction—not enough to cross into frustration and certainly not so much that you fall off the cliff into the pit of despair, but enough to nourish your curious, “moving-toward” energy. As Perel puts it in her TEDx talk, “In desire, we want a bridge to cross.”24 This means intentionally adding distance that creates an edgy instability or uncertainty, a slight and enjoyable dissatisfaction. By way of contrast, John Gottman, in The Science of Trust, says that the problem is not lack of distance and mystery but lack of deepening intimacy. From this point of view, intimate conversation, affection, and friendship are central to the erotic life of a long-term relationship. Gottman reports the findings of a study of one hundred couples, all age forty-five or older, half with good sex lives and half with poor sex lives. Those who reported that they had good sex lives, he writes, “consistently mentioned: (1) maintaining a close, connected, and trusting friendship; and (2) making sex a priority in their lives.”25 In other words, sustaining desire isn’t about having a bridge to cross but about building a bridge together. “Turn toward each other’s desires,” says Gottman. “Keep a comfortable distance,” says Perel. Are you wondering who’s right? They both are—depending, I think, on how you conceptualize “desire.” Remember back in chapter 3, the distinction between eagerness and enjoying? For Perel, desire is eagerness. Wanting. Seeking. Craving. The discrepancy-reducing pursuit of a goal, to put it in romantic terms.26 And for Gottman and the couples in the research he cites, desire has more to do with enjoying. Holding. Savoring. Allowing. Exploring this moment together, noticing what it is like, and liking it. If you’ll allow a food metaphor, Perel’s style is about hunger as the secret sauce that makes a meal delicious. Gottman’s is about arriving home from work and cooking dinner with your partner, having a glass of wine while you cook, feeding each other all the strawberries you meant to keep for dessert, then sitting down together and savoring every mouthful. In the Perel style, you come to your partner with your fire already stoked. In the Gottman style, you stoke each other’s fire. Though both approaches have a lot to offer, our culture generally values one higher than the other. The Mating in Captivity style of desire is higher adrenaline; it’s inherently exciting. We relish this kind of perpetual itch-scratch-relief-itch cycle. We like to want, so much that we can’t always separate the experience of wanting from the experience of liking. The Science of Trust style of desire is lower adrenaline, more a celebration of sensation in context, a celebration of togetherness. My personal inclination is more toward Gottman’s style, while my twin sister said, “Why would closeness ever make anyone want more closeness? Space! ” I know people who swear by one or the other. I know people who are too exhausted to try either. I know people who are convinced that one is the True Way to desire, even though I think they’d benefit by trying out the other. It’s a matter of fit. And I think that in the end, both are strategies for accomplishing the same overall goal: increasing activation of the accelerator and decreasing the brakes. The goal of both approaches is to sustain curiosity: Perel suggests we sustain curiosity about our partner as viewed from a distance; Gottman suggests we sustain curiosity about the very nature of pleasure in the context of commitment. Both are clear that passion doesn’t happen automatically in a long-term, monogamous relationship. But they’re also both clear that passion does happen—as long as the couple takes deliberate control of the context. And every couple’s needs for context are unique."  ^ref-54259

"The One Ring, you remember, is about moving toward or moving away—approach and avoidance, desire or dread. How strongly you desire or dread something depends on the intensity of the activation in the One Ring. Because there’s only One Ring to rule all of your emotional systems, activation of one motivational system can turn up the volume on activation of another motivation system. And what increases intensity of activation? The research suggests two kinds of strategies for building intensity. Strategy 1: Stuff That Raises Your Heart Rate. Early in a relationship, go for heart-pumping intensity, like Romeo and Juliet doing push-ups while they recite their lines. Ride roller coasters, go on long, fast hikes together through the wilderness, watch scary movies, go to giant concerts or political rallies. If you’re a nerd like me, talk about science for hours on end. Do whatever excites you, whatever literally gets your heart beating faster. You’ll experience general arousal, and your brain will notice your level of excitement, notice the person you’re with, and decide, “Hey, I guess this person is really exciting!”"  ^ref-3623

"Strategy 2: Meaningful Challenges. To reinforce commitment and deepen connection, go for novelty and shared, meaningful challenge.29 Play out a lifelong sexual fantasy that you’ve always wanted to try but haven’t found the courage to explore. Turn on the lights—not to put on a show but to open your eyes and look at each other’s faces. Connect. Dive into trust in a big, risky way. Give yourselves, as a couple, something important to work toward. This is a research-based way to “advance the plot” in a relationship that is already at the “happily ever after” phase. Caveat: Neither of these strategies will work if the brakes are on! Arousal-oriented strategies are accelerator-activating strategies, but it doesn’t matter how much you push the accelerator if the brakes are on. You’ll rev the engine and go nowhere."  ^ref-32119

"1. Make a Plan. Be concrete and specific, not abstract and vague. What precisely will you do that will help turn off the brakes? What past experiences do you have that tells you your strategy could work? When exactly will you connect sexually with yourself or your partner? Where will you be? What will you have done immediately before, and what will you do immediately after? What will you wear (or not wear)? Put simply: What sex is worth having, and what will you do to create it in your life? Concrete. Specific. Detailed. 2. Anticipate Barriers. A lot of people skip this step, and that’s a mistake. It’s easy to feel that simply having a plan should be enough. I don’t know if it should be, but I know that it almost never is, because as soon as you bump into an unanticipated barrier, your whole plan could collapse in on itself. You might think, “Well, it’s important to me, so I’ll find a way. I’ll just wing it if I hit an obstacle.” Great! I’m glad it’s important. In fact, don’t try it if it’s not important! And, at the same time, if just “finding a way” were enough, then you wouldn’t need to create change in the first place, you’d already have found your way. Anticipate barriers and make contingency plans.30 3. Connect It to Your Identity. Don’t just run, be a runner. Don’t just have sex, be a deliciously erotic woman who is curious and playful about sex. If you run because you have to or you feel like you’re supposed to, rather than because it’s part of who you are, you won’t run very far or very often, and you probably won’t enjoy it much when you do. And if you have sex because you have to or you feel like you’re supposed to, you won’t have much sex and you probably won’t enjoy it when you do. Don’t just decide to have sex, try on the identity of a woman who loves sex."  ^ref-28036

"Instead, women’s orgasms exist as a byproduct—a result of the fact that male and female genitals develop homologously (remember from chapter 1?).

As a result, orgasm is embedded in female sexual hardware, too, because: homology. Women’s orgasms are, in this way, rather like the hymen. We make a really big deal out of them, culturally—both pro and con—but evolutionarily they’re more or less an afterthought. Both orgasms and hymens are all different from each other because the variety doesn’t affect reproductive success. In other words, women can have orgasms for the same reason men have nipples.

"All your internal states—your physical comfort, hunger, thirst, sleepiness, loneliness, frustration, etc.—interact deep in the emotional One Ring of your brain, and they influence each other in a process called “integration.”27 When one state—like cold feet—interferes with another state—like sexual arousal—that’s “subtractive integration.” And when one state actively reinforces another state, that’s “additive integration.”"  ^ref-41977

"And the women in John Gottman’s research who experienced intense sex after their partners were physically abusive were experiencing additive integration: The threat to their attachment made it important that they bond with their partner. Sex is a crucial attachment behavior for human adults, so the two states—separation anxiety plus sexual stimulation—reinforced each other, to give rise to a sexual experience that was intense but ultimately unsafe and unhealthy."  ^ref-8858

"You can visualize the effect of integration if you think of your brain as a flock of birds. Do you know how a flock works? There is no leader, no individual who controls the group and says, “Hey, everybody, let’s fly this way!” Instead, each bird is individually following a set of rules, along the lines of, “Avoid predators, fly toward the magnetic pole, and also stay by your neighbors.” When all the birds are following these rules, flocking emerges without anyone having to be in charge. If you think of your brain as a flock, then each “bird” is a different drive or incentive motivation system—stress, attachment and social belonging, food appetite, curiosity and exploration, thirst, sleep, plans for the future, emotional baggage from the past—all your competing roles and identities in life are there in the flock. You can think of your sexual accelerator and brakes as birds in the flock, too. Ultimately, the “you” that is consciously aware of being a “self,” an individual distinct from other individuals, is a composite self, a hologram built of these multiple motivational and cognitive processes all engaging with the environment and with each other, in a noisy, messy, multidirectional tug-of-war."  ^ref-40857

Comment: The you consciousness is a system of multiple interaction

"“Subtractive integration” happens when the birds flying toward foot warmth actively tug at the birds who would otherwise fly toward orgasm. Put on socks, and those birds are freed up and can move toward orgasm. “Additive integration” happens when the birds flying toward an attachment object (your sex partner) tug their neighbors to fly faster and more enthusiastically. Fall desperately in love, and your flock may rush to orgasm at the littlest prompting. The technical language for what I’m describing here is that sexual pleasure is an emergent property of a complex dynamical system."  ^ref-62591

Turn on all the owns and turn off all the offs. Get rid of all the predators and pile on different kinds of incentives at the magnetic pole: attachment, stress relief, curiosity, expansive pleasure—all the motivations orgasm can fulfill. The more the whole system is moving in the same direction, the more the orgasm takes over your whole awareness, with every cell of your body focused on the same thing: pleasure. Peak sexual pleasure requires all of you."  ^ref-18637

"The right vibrator provides an intensity of stimulation for your gas pedal that you just can’t replicate with any nonmechanical stimulation. Even if your brakes are still on—you’re stressed out, anxious, sad, or frustrated—a vibrator is often intense enough to generate an orgasm much faster than manual stimulation. A vibrator won’t necessarily persuade all the birds to fly in the same direction. It provides high-intensity stimulation for the parts of your brain that respond to sexually relevant stimuli; it can turn on the owns like nobody’s business, but it doesn’t turn off the offs."  ^ref-39565

Comment: Pleasure and various aliases

---
"A small study of women using vibrators as part of sex therapy found that women varied a great deal in their response to the vibrator and had a wide range of feelings about the experience.30 Initial resistance—“I should be able to orgasm without having to use a ‘tool’ ”—and concerns about whether vibrator use somehow disrupts sexual connection with a partner—“Am I cheating on him with it?”—often gave way to a sense of freedom and exploration. While there was a great deal of variety, even in a sample of only seventeen women, the overall experience was a new kind of pleasure and opening up their perspective on the idea of sexual autonomy. You’ll recognize the worry that it’s not “natural” as the “sanctity” moral foundation that I described in chapter 5. The idea that there’s a pure, good, natural way to have an orgasm and a wrong, bad, unnatural way to have an orgasm is a cultural pigeonholing of experience shaped by those three messages—Moral, Medical, and Media. The concern people most often bring to me about vibrators is that they’ll get “addicted” to them, but it doesn’t happen. Here’s what does happen: Orgasm with vibrators occurs relatively quickly for many women because a vibrator provides such a high intensity of stimulation. And some women get very comfortable with how quickly they orgasm with their vibrator, which leads them to forget how long it took without the vibrator. And when they get frustrated by how long that takes, the frustration makes it take even longer. But by this point in the book, you probably know the answer to this problem: frustration = impatient little monitor. So change the goal, change the effort, change the criterion velocity. Pleasure, not orgasm, is the goal. If it takes five minutes, that’s five minutes of pleasure. Hooray! If it takes thirty minutes, that’s thirty minutes of pleasure! Also hooray!"  ^ref-61894

"Practice turning off the offs. Here’s how: The brain states that are dragging parts of your flock away from orgasm—stress, worry, spectatoring, chronically wondering if your kid is going to knock on the door, or even just literal cold feet or other physical discomfort—need to be taken seriously and have their needs met. They need to be respected and treated like the sleepy hedgehog from chapter 4. Be kind and gentle with each of the offs, listen to what they need in order to feel satisfied, and then satisfy them. Go back to your context worksheets: What hits your brakes? Consider the things in your environment and also your own thoughts and feelings.

Comment: Dealing with stressors

---
"Chronically stressed? Complete the cycle with a good cry, a brisk walk, a primal scream, or other physical release, as described in chapter 4. Give yourself a solid twenty to sixty minutes to allow the stress of the day to wind down with whatever rituals or practices help. Baths, walks, exercise, cooking, meditation, yoga, a glass of wine, whatever works. Constantly monitoring for footsteps in the hallway? Arrange for a time when no one else is home. Tired? Take a nap, or even just rest for twenty minutes. Squicked out by grit on the sheets? Change them! Cold feet? Put on socks! Sometimes it really is this simple. Other offs are more complex and require longer-term solutions, such as those I addressed earlier: self-critical thoughts or other body image challenges, lack of trust in your relationship, trauma history, sexual disgust. It took decades of planting and cultivation to create the garden you currently have. It won’t change overnight. Give yourself permission to make progress gradually, and celebrate all the incremental steps between where you are now and where you’d like to be. And the most important turnoff the offs practice of all: self-kindness. Too often women get stuck in their sexual growth because they can’t get past their belief that something “shouldn’t” hit their brakes. It shouldn’t turn them off to have the lights on, they shouldn’t be so hung up about their bodies. “Should” is all about what you’re “doing wrong.”"  ^ref-43645

I don’t know. But I do know that the little monitor can learn, and Ms. B. can teach it—if she chooses to. She can change her goal, her effort, or her criterion velocity.

"For many of us, the goal states we have in mind—such as spontaneous desire or orgasm with intercourse—are not goals we have chosen consciously for ourselves.

Becoming aware of your scripts is the first step to changing your meta-emotions."  ^ref-54427

"But scripts aren’t about what we intellectually believe is true. They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our little monitor to filter and organize information. You can disagree with a script and still find yourself behaving according to it and interpreting your experience in terms of it. The technical term for this process of organizing your experience according to a preexisting template is “probabilistic generative model.” It means that information—anything you see, hear, smell, touch, or taste—goes first to your emotional brain, where prior learning (possibly about lemons or little rat jackets, possibly about body image or sexual disgust) plus your present brain state (stress, love, self-criticism, disgust, etc.) combine to shape the initial decisions your brain makes about whether to move toward or away from that information. That initial decision sets off a series of expectations about what else might be true and what might happen next."  ^ref-6945

"The first step in changing your meta-emotions is recognizing the difference between the goal state dictated by the script and what you’re actually experiencing. I have two general rules of thumb for navigating this difference: • When the map (the script) doesn’t seem to fit the terrain (your experience), the map is wrong, not the terrain. • Everyone’s terrain and everyone’s map are different from everyone else’s. What these two rules mean is that your best source of knowledge about your sexuality is your own internal experience. When you notice disagreement between the terrain and the map—and everyone does, at some point—always assume your body is right. And assume everyone’s body is different from yours—as are everyone’s maps. Which means everyone’s journey from lost traveler to master navigator will be different."  ^ref-17062

"think that letting go of negative meta-emotions—like the feeling underneath the thought, “I shouldn’t be this way” or “I wish my sexuality were different”—requires that your little monitor move through the pit of despair, recognizing that your previous goal state was unattainable—or at least unattainable in the way you expected to attain it. Our scripts or maps include clear ideas about what the goal, effort, and timelines of our sexuality should be. We should be easily orgasmic, experience spontaneous desire, all of those man-as-default myths. Letting go of those often seems similar to letting go of self-criticism, as I described in chapter 5. We think that if we let go, we’re giving up hope; it feels like failure. This is as true for sex-related goals, like desire style, orgasm, and pleasure, as it is for goals in the rest of life—ending a relationship, deciding not to complete a degree or go to grad school, accepting that your healthy body shape doesn’t match the (unhealthy) cultural ideal. This is what can make changing your map so difficult. It requires a little journey through the pit of despair, grieving for the map that was wrong and all the places you missed as a result. Emotions are tunnels: You have to go through the darkness to get to the light at the end. Sometimes that’s fairly easy. Sometimes it hurts like hell. Sometimes letting go of a particular goal feels like you have to let go of your entire identity. And when letting go hurts, that’s where nonjudging comes in."  ^ref-35395

"how to let go: nonjudging If you’re anxious about your sexuality, or you’re angry with yourself for feeling (or not feeling) a certain way, or you’re ashamed, what you will often do is put that feeling about your sexuality in a box and hide it somewhere deep inside you. And the feeling sits in that box, waiting to complete its cycle. You haven’t gotten rid of it, you’ve just put it on hold. It’s as if that small part of you is sitting on a roller coaster, stuck at the top of an ascent—eventually it will have to come down. It has to. It has to complete its cycle."  ^ref-29181

"Now suppose that instead of putting it in a box, you’re aware of your feeling about your sexuality and are curious about it, or you’re gently affectionate toward it, as you would be toward a tearful newborn or a sad, shy kitten, or you’re simply neutrally observing from the sidelines of your own internal experience. These kinds of compassionate self-awareness create a context that doesn’t hit the brakes and instead allows your internal state to complete its cycle. I used to think that it was the awareness of your internal state that mattered, but in study after study, “observation” of internal state is not a significant predictor of wellbeing.4 No, the best meta-emotion predictor of wellbeing is a variable known as “nonjudge.”5 People who score low on nonjudge agree with statements like, “I tell myself that I shouldn’t be thinking the way I’m thinking” and “When I have distressing thoughts or images, I judge myself as good or bad, depending on what the thought/image is about.” People who are high on nonjudging say the opposite: When they have distressing thoughts, they simply recognize that that’s what’s happening, without judging themselves as good or bad, right or wrong. In other words, nonjudging allows you to feel what you feel, whether or not it makes sense to you, whether or not it’s comfortable, whether or not it’s what you believe you should be feeling. Nonjudging is neutrally noticing your own internal states."  ^ref-37608

"In Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child, psychologist John Gottman describes four different approaches a parent can take in responding to a child’s feelings: emotion coaching, dismissing, disapproving, and laissez-faire. I’ll refer to the last three (less supportive) approaches together as emotion dismissing.8 Emotion coaching teaches you that • You can recognize lower-intensity emotions so that you can manage them before they escalate. • Negative emotions are a natural response to negative life events. Because negative life events are sometimes inevitable, so are negative emotions. • Because negative emotions are a normal part of life, they are discussed, given names, and empathized with. • “It’s normal that sometimes it feels hard,” “When you feel bad, we love you just as much as when you feel good,” and “You cry all you need to, honey.” • Your sadness, anger, and fear are signs of being human. Emotion dismissing, on the other hand, teaches you that • You should ignore subtle or lower-intensity emotions—they’re irrelevant. • Negative emotions are toxic, dangerous to yourself and the people around you. • Negative feelings are a choice, something you could select in the morning like part of your outfit. Because they’re a choice, negative emotions may be punished—even if there is no overt misbehavior. • “Get over it,” “Be grateful for all the good things,” or “C’mon, give me a smile, honey!” • Your sadness, anger, and fear are signs of failure—either your own or your family’s. In other words, emotion coaching teaches you that feelings are tunnels, and you can allow yourself to go through the darkness to get to the light. Emotion dismissing, on the other hand, teaches you that feelings aren’t a tunnel, they’re a cave . . . with a river of cyanide . . . and a thousand rats . . . in the dark. Where you’ll be trapped forever. So whatever you do, KEEP OUT."  ^ref-46896

"And bear in mind that emotion dismissing is often lovingly intended. “Don’t cry, honey,” seems like a thoroughly benevolent sentiment, motivated by a desire to help someone who is suffering to feel better. But underneath “Don’t cry, honey,” is a subtle hint that the feelings are unwelcome. That you’re making other people uncomfortable. That it would be easier for everyone if you just didn’t feel that, so please stop. But uncomfortable feelings happen. They are the normal, healthy response to negative life events. When you experience an injustice, anger happens. When you experience a loss, sadness happens. When you experience obstacles in your progress toward a goal, frustration happens. When you experience a threat, fear happens. And even if you only anticipate any of these things, you may very well experience the emotion, and it will be just as uncomfortable as if the thing were actually happening. Things that happen also end. Every single time, as long as you don’t slam on the brakes to stop yourself from going through the tunnel."  ^ref-56161

Comment: Emotional dismissal

"Here are three ways to think about nonjudging that I’ve seen women use effectively: • Remember that feelings are biological cycles with a beginning, a middle, and an end, built in. You believed me when I said it earlier, right? When we got chased by a lion? And the kid came out from under anesthesia? Feeling an emotion won’t get you trapped forever in that emotion; on the contrary, it will allow you to move through it, like a tunnel. It might not be fun, but it’s not dangerous. Your body knows how to do it. All you have to do is allow it. • Some people find it helpful to think about allowing feelings in the same way they allow themselves to pee and poop. It’s built into the system. You don’t tell yourself you shouldn’t have to pee, you just wait for an appropriate time and place. And if your need to pee is urgent, you seek out an appropriate context. Same goes for feelings. They’re a natural part of being human, built into our biology. Cultural rules mean we can’t just feel our feeling anywhere we want, but we can find an appropriate time and place. • The flock metaphor from chapter 8: Nonjudging is allowing the birds in the flock to fly away from a predator. Sometimes people are afraid that if they let those birds fly away, they’ll fly away from the predator forever. But that’s not how the system works. Once the birds have escaped from the predator (or noticed spontaneously that there is no predator after all), they’ll transition back to flying toward the magnetic pole along with their neighbors. But if you don’t allow them to fly away—if you say to yourself, “I shouldn’t have that feeling,” and slam on the brake—that’s like trying to cage the birds who are trying to escape. And how will those birds react? They’ll freak out, batter themselves against the bars, desperate to escape both the predator and the cage. Allow them to escape and trust that they’ll rejoin the flock. Finally, a suggestion: Start small. Most mindfulness or other meditation training starts with paying attention to something simple, like your breath or eating a raisin. The smell and taste of a raisin are straightforward and nonthreatening, compared to the sensation of anger or shame or grief. Learning to notice how a raisin smells, tastes, and feels in your mouth builds a platform on which you can begin to experience more complicated and difficult sensations with the same attentive neutrality—nonjudging."  ^ref-34568

"Here’s an emotion-dismissing meta-emotion I hear a lot: “If there is no solution to an uncomfortable feeling, there’s no point feeling it.” Yes, there is. The point of feeling a feeling you can’t do anything about is to let it discharge, complete the cycle, so that it can end."  ^ref-42747

"The threat—the misogynist jerk—wasn’t around anymore to fight against or run away from . . . and yet she still had these feelings. So what could she do with them? She could complete the cycle. The Feels exist in her body, without reference to the jerk whom she successfully left behind. But this is not the habit most of us learn early in our lives, and it takes practice. When we have feelings we can’t really do anything about and we don’t know how to let ourselves simply feel without doing anything, our brains will look for some situation it can do something about, and it will try to impose the feelings on that situation. So don’t be mad at the guy who’s long gone. Just allow the anger to move through you. It doesn’t matter what it’s about, it’s just random Feels, left over from the past, that have to work themselves out. Don’t hit the gas pedal, but don’t hit the brake either.

"When a person experiences trauma, it’s like someone snuck into their garden and ripped out all the plants they had been cultivating with such care and attention. This is particularly awful when the person who tears up the garden is not a stranger but someone the person trusted. There is rage and betrayal, there is grief for the garden as it was, and there is fear that it will never grow back. But it will grow back. That’s what gardens do. And you facilitate that growth by allowing the garden to be what it is, in process, rather than what it was or what you wish it were. How? Self-compassion: self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Patience. Feeling okay with feeling not-okay. Healing hurts. If you break your leg, there is no stage in the healing process when your leg feels better than it does after it has healed. There is pain and itching and loss of strength. From the moment your leg is broken, it continues to feel bad . . . until, gradually, it starts to feel less bad. It’s appropriate that it hurts. If you numb physical pain, healing can still happen. Alas, if we try to “numb” emotional pain, we get a break from the pain . . . but the healing is put on pause, too. People who are more evolved than I am can go through emotions like grief and panic without suffering, but for most of us, heart healing doesn’t happen without suffering. Sorry."  ^ref-61637

"there are two especially important ground rules for couples when it comes to communicating about sex. Neither of you chose your feelings—but both of you choose how you feel about those feelings. One of the most problematic messages in emotion dismissing meta-emotions is that emotional reactions are a choice. Like you’re “choosing” to have responsive desire or “choosing” not to have orgasms with intercourse. But you don’t choose that stuff. You didn’t choose the brain chemistry you were born with, you didn’t choose the family or the culture you were born into, and you don’t choose what your body does today in response to sexually relevant stimuli. What you can choose is how you feel about all of that—and so can your partner. And feeling okay with it is what makes the difference. If you’re in a relationship where one partner wants sex more than the other, it is seriously unhelpful if one partner feels that the other is “choosing” their desire level. Remember the chasing dynamic from chapter 7? What you do choose is compassion—or not. Patience—or not. With both yourself and your partner. When you find yourself stuck in a frustrating argument about sex, ask out loud, “Are we both choosing compassion and patience right now?” (Hint: You can’t make someone be patient any more than you can make someone have an orgasm. You create a great context, and then allow it to happen.) Feelings aren’t dangerous . . . though they can be used dangerously. One of the central messages in emotion dismissing meta-emotions is that feelings are inherently dangerous—toxic and hurtful to yourself and the people around you. People may believe this if they grew up in a world where people used feelings to injure or manipulate others—and using your feelings to deliberately hurt people is against the rules. Most important: You’re not allowed to use your own feelings to injure or manipulate yourself! (Self-compassion!) Nor are you allowed to use them to injure or manipulate your partner or others—and other people, including your partner, aren’t allowed to use them against you, either. But feeling your Feels is safe. Being emotionally uncomfortable isn’t inherently dangerous. It’s not even scary—when you trust that allowing the discomfort to move through its cycle will always and inevitably end in feeling better. Witnessing your partner’s Feels may feel uncomfortable for you; it may activate your desire to Make Your Partner Feel Better or Fix the Problem. That’s normal, that’s okay. Remember that the way to make someone feel better and fix the problem is to allow the person to move all the way through the tunnel, complete the cycle. This is not a stimulus-response kind of problem—like “IF Partner Is Crying, THEN Cheer Partner Up Instantly.” No. If your partner is crying or otherwise having an intense emotional experience, remember it’s their sleepy hedgehog, and your job is to listen for what the hedgehog needs while allowing your partner to complete the cycle. Being afraid of feelings or being angry about them—your own or your partner’s—only increases the fear and anger in your relationship, which makes your sex life worse. Being nonjudging about the feelings creates a space where your partner can complete the cycle and thus get the heck out of the way of your confidence, joy, and ecstasy. Remember the sleepy hedgehog. It doesn’t help either you or your Feels if you shove them in your partner’s face and say, “ACCEPT THIS!” How would you respond if your partner did that to you? Unless you’re a saint of unrivaled patience and tolerance, you would get defensive—and fair enough. Shoving your Feels in your partner’s face is using your feelings as a weapon, and that’s never okay. There are excellent books about how to listen to your partner and how to manage feelings in a relationship. In chapter 4, I recommended Love Sense by Sue Johnson, and to that recommendation I’ll add What Makes Love Last? How to Build Trust and Avoid Betrayal by John Gottman and Nan Silver."  ^ref-20103

Comment: Generalize

"The willingness to tolerate greater effort—in this case, pain—is learned. And it can be changed, simply by becoming aware of it and allowing the possibility that it could be different. Pain is a signal that your body needs help. If you use your own internal experience, rather than culturally imposed criterion velocities, as your most accurate source of knowledge about sex, you’ll be able to hear your body’s signal that it needs help, and you’ll take it seriously. This is as literal as it gets: It’s not how you feel (pain). It’s how you feel (tolerant or not) about how you feel."  ^ref-42776

"“We’re all just trying to belong somewhere.” We want to know that we are safe within the bounds of shared human experience, that what’s on our map is the same as what is on other people’s maps. If we find ourselves in a place that we can’t find on our map—that is, if we have an experience for which we have no frame of reference, no script—we feel lost. Unknown territory feels risky, unsafe—remember from chapter 4: “I am lost/I am home.” In unknown territory, we feel, “I am at risk!” Our stress response kicks in and we’re like that Iggy Pop rat: Everything seems like a potential threat. But then if someone comes along and says, “You’re okay—see, I’ve got this place here on my map. This is definitely part of the territory,” we can relax. We know we’re still at home, safe within bounds. We belong here. When people ask me, “Am I normal?” they’re asking, “Do I belong?” The answer is yes. You belong in your body. You belong in the world. You’ve belonged since the day you were born, this is your home. You don’t have to earn it by conforming to some externally imposed sexual standard. If you change your goal to “wherever I belong,” then you’re always successful because you’re already there."  ^ref-34499

"The day you were born, the world had a choice about what to teach you about your body. It could have taught you to live with confidence and joy inside your body. It could have taught you that your body and your sexuality are beautiful gifts. But instead, the world taught you to feel critical of and dissatisfied with your sexuality and your body. You were taught to value and expect something from your sexuality that does not match what your sexuality actually is. You were told a story about what would happen in your sexual life, and that story was false. You were lied to. I am pissed, on your behalf, at the world for that lie. And I’m working to create a world that doesn’t lie to women about their bodies anymore. I can’t change the injury that the world inflicted on you, and neither can you. What you can do is heal."  ^ref-29905

"You are normal. Beautiful. And as long as you’re not experiencing pain, you’re healthy. So when you notice yourself feeling dissatisfied with your sexuality, when you notice shame or frustration or grief, allow yourself to direct those feelings away from yourself and instead focus the emotions toward the culture that told you the wrong story. Rage not against yourself but against the culture that lied to you. Grieve not for your discrepancy from a fictitious “ideal” that is at best arbitrary and at worst an act of oppression and violence; grieve for the compassionate world you were born deserving . . . and did not get. The purpose of allowing yourself to feel those Feels is not to change something out in the world. Feel your Feels so that they can discharge, release, and create space for something new inside you. When you allow that grief to move through you, you are letting go of the sexual person you were told you “should be,” a phantom self that has taken up space in your mind for too long. And letting go of that phantom creates spaces for the sexual person you are. And when we all practice this, the world does change, person by person."  ^ref-13084

Comment: What this book is about and women's sexuality

---
"This world is full of fun, exciting, entertaining things that draw and hold our attention. But the structure of the truth is quieter, slower, more personal, and so much more interesting than mere entertainment. And it lives exclusively inside you, in the quiet moments of joy, in the jarring moments of worry, in the torn moments when the flock that is you is trying simultaneously to fly away from a threat and toward a pleasure. So when you notice something unexpected inside yourself and you want to look outward to check if it’s normal, if you’re okay, remember me saying this: You are okay."  ^ref-57202
