# The Power of Intuition by Gary Klein

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> Real-life decisions are often challenging and complex, time is limited and we don’t have complete information for a fool-proof analysis. This book demystifies the concept of intuition and provides a pragmatic approach to intuitive decision-making, i.e. how to translate our experience into judgement, decisions and actions.^[https://readingraphics.com/book-summary-the-power-of-intuition/]

### Cognitive Task Analysis

There's also the book called Working Minds by the same author. It focuses on Cognitive Task Analysis - aka how to understand how people think and what they think.

This blurb will needed to be expanded upon. Can read more about it here: https://www.globalcognition.org/cognitive-task-analysis/
