# Marry Him by Lori Gottlieb

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> An eye-opening, funny, painful, and always truthful in-depth examination of modern relationships and a wake-up call for single women about getting real about Mr. Right. You have a fulfilling job, great friends, and the perfect apartment. So what if you haven’t found “The One” just yet. He’ll come along someday, right? But what if he doesn’t? Or what if Mr. Right had been, well, Mr. Right in Front of You—but you passed him by? Nearing forty and still single, journalist Lori Gottlieb started to wonder: What makes for lasting romantic fulfillment, and are we looking for those qualities when we’re dating? Are we [[Be less critical of others by taking a pause to reflect|too picky]] about trivial things that don’t matter, and not picky enough about the often overlooked things that do? In Marry Him, Gottlieb explores an all-too-common dilemma—how to reconcile the desire for a happy marriage with a list of must-haves and deal-breakers so long and complicated that many great guys get misguidedly eliminated. On a quest to find the answer, Gottlieb sets out on her own journey in search of love, discovering wisdom and surprising insights from sociologists and neurobiologists, marital researchers and behavioral economists—as well as single and married men and women of all generations.

### Thoughts and reflections

This was a book shared to me by my friend %%[[Annie Chen]]%%. She said that it helped her evaluate if she wanted to stay with her boyfriend, or if she should be seeking out another person.

It was very surprising to me that he the sense of entitlement that some women may have in terms of their dating value. Some of it can be attributed to the cultural message that we receive in terms of 'We are a treasure', yet we cannot compromise to find someone else.

We need to understand that we are a whole package and to accept another person with all their flaws. Love is born out of effort and working for things together, not from something magical.

## Dealbreakers in dating

According to Greenwald, anything which is objective (hair, looks, age, etc.) should not be part of our dating dealbreakers. Instead, we should focus on what is subjective (maturity, values, kindness, sensitivity, ability to commit.)

### Selflessness and humility are important traits in marriage

Some of the most important qualities in marriage are selflessness and humility. In marriage, we often have to decide between maximizing our personal happiness or the other person.

As we ourselves should learn to be selfless for our partner, we should seek someone who would return the favour, quid pro quo. We should have someone who is able to say that it doesn't matter who is right or wrong and to focus on the problem instead.^[ [[_HL Marry him by Lori Gottieb#^ref-48507]]]

Research by John Gottman in [[The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman|The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work by John Gottman]] also support the fact that "marital success can be predicted with 91% accuracy by looking at basic qualities such as compromise, tolerance and communication style".

## Compromising is not settling

### Find th right romantic partner not the perfect one

We should for look for someone who can complement us, not someone who completes us. When choosing someone to spend our lives with, we have to take them as a whole package (a deal) which works best for what we seek out of life.

We need to understand that everybody has their pros and cons. Likewise, we need to adjust dating expectations by not [[unrealistic expectations|expecting too much]].

### How to find the right partner according to Clampitt - a matchmaker

What are some effective romantic partner matching strategies? What should we look for in a partner?

1. Do you have common relationship goals?
2. How similar are your values? How highly do you rank things like independence, family, religion, loyalty?
3. What are the quick qualities that a person needs? Limit yourself to 5 such as - this person needs to be highly intelligent.
4. Do you have some shared similar interests? Shared hobbies are good for bonding and fun to share, but they are not as important for the long term as all the other factors.

## Romance is in the discovery of your partner

According to Ferman, Romance is about the evolution of a relationship. It should be about learning how the other person can surprise you and the new things about them.

## Human desires are fickle and change with circumstances

According to Dan Ariely, a behavioral economist as MIT - author of [[Predictably Irrational by Dan Ariely|Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]], Humans often don't know what we want in a moment, and we fail to account the fact that our desires change through time as we deal with life circumstances.

### Less is more effect

According to one study on online dating, mysterious traits allow the profile viewer to fill in the gaps. If we describe ourselves in ambiguous terms, we tend to be more likable. It might be part of a self serving bias where we project our desires onto others.^[ [[_HL Marry him by Lori Gottieb#^ref-38846]]]

### Overabundance of dating options creates noise

When we have too many options in dating according to Dan Ariely, we strike out people who we would consider if there were fewer options. If we spread ourselves too thinly, we produce too much noise, which prevents us from making the right choice supply. This applies in dating with an overabundance of options.

#### Focus on quality introductory messages

There's an archetype in online dating called the 'juggler' who are people who are managing 15 or more communications at once. According to Dan Ariely, people who juggled less wrote longer and more thoughtful messages and had a higher likelihood of going on a date.

### Sought dating characteristics are often unrelated with our dating choices

> “There was a lack of correlation between what people said they wanted on the questionnaire, and what they actually picked when they met a real, live person."
> \- [[_HL Marry him by Lori Gottieb#^ref-64834|Highlights from Marry him by Lori Gottieb]]

Based on a study by Eli Finkel, a social psychologist from Northwestern university, people were asked what kind of characteristics they were looking for in a dating partner. 

However, after going on the date, and rating their level of enjoyment, it was uncorrelated to the original mentioned characteristics. As humans, it can be hard to explain why we make certain choices.

#### M&M Analogy

Finkel explains it using the following allowing of M&M's:

> [!NOTE] M&M analogy
> Finkel explained it using my favorite candy from childhood, M&M’S. “If you ask people why they like M&M’S,” he said, “they might tell you it’s because of the candy shell. But if you give them another candy with the same shell, they won’t like it as much as the M&M. So it’s not the shell. It must be something else that they like about the M&M.”
> …
> Finkel believes. “People can accurately tell you what they like, but not why. So if a woman says, ‘I’m attracted to this man,’ that’s accurate. She is attracted to him. But if she says it’s because he makes money, that might not be the accurate explanation. It might actually be because he’s generous.” That’s the mistake many of us make: Our must-haves and deal-breakers are the “what,” when they should be the “why.”

## Focus on positives rather than dwelling on negatives

%%alias: focus on the good, dwelling on the bad%%

- Related to [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]]
- See also [[We are all a package deal - flaws and all|We are all a package deal - flaws and all]] so we should learn to have [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|humility]] in dating.

### Say yes more often instead of no

In the context of dating, we should often try to say yes more often than no. We should be screening in rather screening out people on technicalities. Otherwise, we may just end up alone because we've rejected completely valid options.

> Always ask yourself this: If an interesting guy were right in front of you, would you honestly turn that person away because of a few pounds or inches, or a sentence in a profile that you don’t like? If so, that’s fine. Just don’t complain when you can’t find anybody suitable because you’ve eliminated every potential guy on a technicality. Because if these guys eliminated people on technicalities, they probably wouldn’t date you, either.”
> \- [[_HL Marry him by Lori Gottieb#^ref-36984]]

### Secure attachments are boring and that's good

When we're mismatched with someone, we may mistake dating butterflies caused by [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|anxious attachment]]. Instead, we should seek a level of 'normalcy' which may even seem boring because it's not triggering high emotional responses through our amygdala.

The most intense (but not necessarily good!) relationships are between anxious-avoidant romantic pairs - as explained within [[Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller|Attached by Amir Levine Rachel Heller]].

### Tally the positive points

One good strategy for when deciding whether to date someone is to tally up their positive points instead of deducting what is lacking. People who score high should be someone we have interest in. This prevents us from focusing on disappointing aspects and [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|focusing on the negative]].

![[_HL Marry him by Lori Gottieb#^ref-59643|Marry Him]]

### Positive illusions

Successful married couples focus on the positives of their partners and may even embellish their mental self image. It's a type of [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive bias]].

> "Toning down the attitude doesn’t just help in dating—it makes marriages better, too. That’s what Gian Gonzaga, a psychologist and senior scientist at eHarmony who met his wife while working in the famous “marriage lab” at UCLA, told me. His research, which involves studying six hundred couples over the span of several years, focuses on relationship satisfaction and the predictors of marriage success. “Happily married people believe that their partners are better than the average person, even though that’s statistically impossible,” Gonzaga explained. “We call those ‘positive illusions.’ It’s not that people don’t complain about their spouses or have [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|disagreements]]. It’s that at the end of the day, they still see them as superior to most of the people out there.”"

## Similar people attract one another

We attract people with similar things to us. This includes the good and the bad. If we are someone who is stable, intelligent or competent, etc. we will also attract someone who is similar to us.

But if we're dysfunctional or neurotic, we might get someone who is also similar to that. We should take a hard look in the mirror to see what kind of people are attracting.

> “We tend to be attracted to people who are similar to us in terms of emotional stability, intellect, and competence,” he said. “So if you date people who always seem dysfunctional, you’re probably equally dysfunctional. If this person is neurotic, you probably are, too. To attract the kind of person you have in your mind, you have to be that kind of person. It’s not that all the guys you dated weren’t good enough for you. People need to realize that they bring their own selves into the equation.”

### Maximizers and satisficers

What is a maximizer?

What is a satisficer?

Looking for an answer, which is good enough.
