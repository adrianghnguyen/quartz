## Thoughts and Reflections

This is one of the more influential books I've read in recent years. It helps us understand what motivates people in the terms of shame. In general, if you understand how someone was brought up and what was cultivated within them, then you can see why they might react so strongly to something.

Humans are very good at absorbing information around them. So as children, we become easily influenced with such messages of shame and [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]]. This extends to our [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski|sexual pleasure]] which is mainly built in the mind.
