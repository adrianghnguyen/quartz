# On Love by Alain de Botton

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> The New York Times-bestselling author’s modern classic that “takes a conventional love story and textures it with philosophical ruminations” (Kirkus Reviews). A man and a woman meet over casual conversation on a flight from Paris to London, and so begins a love story—from first kiss to first argument, elation to heartbreak, and everything in between. Each stage of the relationship is illuminated with starling clarity, as novelist and philosopher Alain de Botton explores young love and its emotions, often felt but rarely understood. With a brilliant new introduction by Sheila Heti, the New York Times-bestselling author of How Should a Person Be?, On Love is a contemporary classic from an author “who seems to have been born to write” (The Boston Globe). “Smart and ironic…The book’s success has much to do with its beautifully modeled sentences, its wry humor, and its unwavering deadpan respect for the reader's intelligence.” —Francine Prose, New Republic “Witty, funny, sophisticated…full of wise and illuminating insights.” —P.J. Kavanagh, Spectator
