## Thoughts and Reflections

I remember reading this during my time at the [[University of Waterloo]]. Gotta admit - it wasn't my finest moment and I was a big skirt chaser until my friend called me out on it. It was coming from a place of [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt]] and poor self-worth as a result of my need to be accepted ([[The need to belong is the root of social connection]]). Society tells you that you need to chase women, success, whatever as its values.

I think this book was informative in terms of learning why certain behaviors are attractive coming from a psychology perspective. Now armed with further knowledge, I know why vulnerability is what creates deep connections ([[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited]]). Likewise, when we feel like we have [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|true self-esteem]] ([[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself]]) we have nothing left to prove to others ([[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]]).

Why is neediness unattractive? Because it means we are changing our behaviors to comply with the expectations of others which means presenting a false self-image. This honeymoon period where we present a masquerade is also discussed within [[Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix]].

I do think that the root of love ([[Love can take many forms and definitions]]) is having others accept as who you are ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]]) - with your flaws and all.
