# Crying in H Mart by Michelle Zauner

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the indie rock sensation known as Japanese Breakfast, an unforgettable memoir about family, food, grief, love, and growing up Korean American—“in losing her mother and cooking to bring her back to life, Zauner became herself” (NPR). • CELEBRATING OVER ONE YEAR ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST In this exquisite story of family, food, grief, and endurance, Michelle Zauner proves herself far more than a dazzling singer, songwriter, and guitarist. With humor and heart, she tells of growing up one of the few Asian American kids at her school in Eugene, Oregon; of struggling with her mother's particular, high expectations of her; of a painful adolescence; of treasured months spent in her grandmother's tiny apartment in Seoul, where she and her mother would bond, late at night, over heaping plates of food. As she grew up, moving to the East Coast for college, finding work in the restaurant industry, and performing gigs with her fledgling band--and meeting the man who would become her husband--her Koreanness began to feel ever more distant, even as she found the life she wanted to live. It was her mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer, when Michelle was twenty-five, that forced a reckoning with her identity and brought her to reclaim the gifts of taste, language, and history her mother had given her. Vivacious and plainspoken, lyrical and honest, Zauner's voice is as radiantly alive on the page as it is onstage. Rich with intimate anecdotes that will resonate widely, and complete with family photos, Crying in H Mart is a book to cherish, share, and reread.

## Thoughts and reflections

[[2023-12-23]] This book has made me reflect a lot about [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] and my own [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|father's passing]]. I think that grief perhaps does not need to make sense, that we can only weave a narrative in the aftermath.

I envy the connection she had with her mother, to look at her so fondly and to have a culture to connect it all. Perhaps it is yet my season to bloom. At the time of writing her memoir, Michelle had been stumbling through life, from job to job. But it is only in retrospective that our [[Coherence is understanding our life narrative|overall life narrative]] starts making sense. 

Perhaps these last two years, have brought something to me. I need to [[Survivor mentality|survive]] through this period to find meaning. If I can begin working in earnest on my mental health technology tools, and to find my path someway somehow, I think I'll figure out what I need to do next. My success will probably not be immediate, but I would like to [[Learned optimism is a skill|stay optimistic]] and believe that my time will come. 

It's through the little actions of the everyday that we connect to our communities, the ones who came before us and the one who passed away. By being alive, I am keeping him alive as well. 

There are many things about me he'll never have a chance to see, falling in love, graduating, etc. But I feel less lonely for having read this book, to know that life is messy in its own ways. All we need are some strong pillars to lean on when life's gusts wishes to push us over.

Keep on moving bit by bit and life will become back. To live is to move. 

The book made me reflect on the value of having a community. In her mother's death and decease, the Korean friends, and her own partner were there to bear her slow decline of health. I wish I had small memories to cling onto. My words...are hardly poetic and the story does not make sense. 

But thank you for having writing that book. For the ones who feel lost without their community. I'm glad to have read your words.

### [[2023-12-24]] A short review %% to [[My An|My An %%]]

I've read Tuesdays with Morrie when I was younger, but this is a such a personally intimate memoir of the bond between a mother and a daughter (I don't typically read such books). The book shows what it means to live in-between worlds, Korean-American, between the life and death of her mother, between chapters of our lives. 

I've listened to her music before, but didn't know her story (her first album has a picture of her mom and her friend). We cling onto the past, because they're eternally preserved, but to move on and to see the degradation of time can be quite difficult. We engage in rituals and customs to find a tie to what came before us. And through this book, her mother gets to live forever.

Pour moi, it was meaningful to hear how grief brings a sense of impotence in the face of death, to keep moving is to live and that life is bumbling around where occasionally we are smiled upon us with kindness and help from others. To know that powerful feelings can give birth to art and meaning. Maybe my story is still unfolding in this chapter of my life. I'd like to think there's more to be penned.
