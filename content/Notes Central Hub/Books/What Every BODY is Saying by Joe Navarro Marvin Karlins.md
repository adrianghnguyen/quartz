## What Every BODY is Saying by Joe Navarro Marvin Karlins

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> A book by a former FBI profiling/behavior expert on how to read body language. It's not magical and can't tell you everything about a person. However, general body cues can give insights into someone's current mood and serve as leads to press further.

## Thoughts and Reflections

I honestly forgot why I had read this book a long time ago. I think what I learned from it is that you can tell someone's general mood and it follows alongside the principle of gravity.

If someone is in a more positive mood, their language will be more open/receptive and pulled upwards. Think someone standing with shoulders broad. Contrarily, someone who feels under threat ([[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges]]), they will close themselves off, a remnant of behavior from the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]] - our primordial brain. That means they'll close themselves off, and protect their vital organs.

For example, someone who feels uncomfortable might start scratching their neck (protect the throat), close their arms (protect the heart), cross their legs (protect genitals), etc. Likewise, happy people will feel light on their feet, head high, etc. Perhaps it's because they feel confident as an apex predator so they can more readily engage threats? IDK that's just my theory.

We do know that in animals a strategy is to cower. That explains the negative side of things. Can't really explain the confident behavior just yet.
