## Summary

> You will experience psychological impasse many times in your life. During these times, you have the sensation that you’re stuck or paralyzed. You’re convinced that something must change, whether in your work or personal life. Though this feeling is normal, you need to move beyond it. Failure to “get unstuck” can put your career and personal life—as well as the healthy functioning of your team or organization—at risk.

Book focuses on how to examine factors concerning careers and how to focus it for positive change.

'Embrace the suck' and sit with the anxiety. [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|Meditate.]]

## Thoughts And Reflections

While reading a section in the beginning, the person mentions that the client is looking deeply for parental approval. Reflecting upon myself, I've always wanted my [[Tim Trinh|stepdad]]'s approval. Does he respect my choices? Does he recognize me as a grown adult? ^15f73a

Overall - pretty meh book. I think the important takeaways was about learning to listen through your [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxieties]]. I feel like the book is not concrete enough and writes out too many anecdotes.
