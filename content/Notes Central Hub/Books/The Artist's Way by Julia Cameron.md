# The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> "With its gentle affirmations, inspirational quotes, fill-in-the-blank lists and tasks — write yourself a thank-you letter, describe yourself at 80, for example — The Artist’s Way proposes an egalitarian view of creativity: Everyone’s got it."—The New York Times "Morning Pages have become a household name, a shorthand for unlocking your creative potential"—Vogue Over four million copies sold! Since its first publication, The Artist's Way phenomena has inspired the genius of Elizabeth Gilbert and millions of readers to embark on a creative journey and find a deeper connection to process and purpose. Julia Cameron's novel approach guides readers in uncovering problems areas and pressure points that may be restricting their creative flow and offers techniques to free up any areas where they might be stuck, opening up opportunities for self-growth and self-discovery. The program begins with Cameron’s most vital tools for creative recovery – The Morning Pages, a daily writing ritual of three pages of stream-of-conscious, and The Artist Date, a dedicated block of time to nurture your inner artist. From there, she shares hundreds of exercises, activities, and prompts to help readers thoroughly explore each chapter. She also offers guidance on starting a “Creative Cluster” of fellow artists who will support you in your creative endeavors. A revolutionary program for personal renewal, The Artist's Way will help get you back on track, rediscover your passions, and take the steps you need to change your life.

> FEAR
>
> ONE OF THE MOST important tasks in artistic recovery is learning to call things—and ourselves—by the right names. Most of us have spent years using the wrong names for our behaviors. We have wanted to create and we have been unable to create and we have called that inability laziness. This is not merely inaccurate. It is cruel. Accuracy and compassion serve us far better.
>
> Blocked artists are not lazy. They are [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|blocked]].
>
> Being blocked and being lazy are two different things. The blocked artist typically expends a great deal of energy—just not visibly. The blocked artist spends energy on [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]], on regret, on grief, and on jealousy. The blocked artist spends energy on self-doubt.
>
> The blocked artist does not know how to begin with baby steps. Instead, the blocked artist thinks in terms of great big scary impossible tasks: a novel, a feature film, a one-person show, an opera. When [[Little monitors seek to resolve worldly discrepancies|these large tasks are not accomplished]], or even begun, the blocked artist calls that laziness.
>
> Do not call the inability to start laziness. Call it fear.
>
> Fear is the true name for what ails the blocked artist. It may be fear of failure or fear of success. Most frequently, it is fear of abandonment. This fear has roots in childhood reality. Most blocked artists tried to become artists against either their parents’ good wishes or their parents’ good judgment. For a youngster this is quite a conflict. To go squarely against your parents’ values means you’d better know what you’re doing. You’d better not just be an artist. You better be a great artist if you’re going to hurt your parents so much….
>
> Parents do act hurt when children rebel, and declaring oneself an artist is usually viewed by parents as an act of rebellion. Unfortunately, the view of an artist’s life as an adolescent rebellion often lingers, making any act of art entail the risk of separation and the loss of loved ones. Because artists still yearn for their creative goals, they then feel guilty.
>
> This guilt demands that they set a goal for themselves right off the bat that they must be great artists in order to justify this rebellion.
>
> The need to be a great artist makes it hard to be an artist.
>
> The need to produce a great work of art makes it hard to produce any art at all.
>
> Finding it hard to begin a project does not mean you will not be able to do it. It means you will need help—from your higher power, from supportive friends, and from yourself. First of all, you must give yourself permission to begin small and go in baby steps. These steps must be rewarded. Setting impossible goals creates enormous fear, which creates procrastination, which we wrongly call laziness.
>
> Do not call procrastination laziness. Call it fear.
>
> Fear is what blocks an artist. The fear of not being good enough. The fear of not finishing. The fear of failure and of success. The fear of beginning at all. There is only one cure for fear. That cure is love.
>
> Use love for your artist to cure its fear.
>
> Stop yelling at yourself. Be nice. Call fear by its right name.

## Laziness and procrastination are better seen as a form of avoidance

A passage shared by my friend %% [[Mary Ma|Mary Ma]] %% and it sparked a thought or rather source of inspiration for understanding the nature of fear. We may avoid engaging in [[We avoid authentic pursuits due to personal fears|authentic pursuits]] as a result of [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]] and other types of fears.

A [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|kinder way]] of looking at our state of [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological impasse]] is to see of it as a form of blockage. We may be avoiding something From my personal experience, very few people are inherently lazy - we just have things which we may have [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|undealt and buried stress responses]] which have been [[Emotional suppression and denial|pushed away]].

The fear of the artist and that of one's inner psychology seems to overlap - are we not the painter of our future? [[Make the future you want with personal agency|We wield the brush]] but sometimes these colours may have been tarnished by remaining [[The garden of shame metaphor|colours of our past]].
