# Japanese Death Poems Compiled by Yoel Hoffman

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> Although the consciousness of death is, in most cultures, very much a part of life, this is perhaps nowhere more true than in Japan, where the approach of death has given rise to a centuries-old tradition of writingÂ _jisei_, or the "death poem." Such a poem is often written in the very last moments of the poet's life.
>
> Hundreds of Japanese death poems, many with a commentary describing the circumstances of the poet's death, have been translated into English here, the vast majority of them for the first time

## Thoughts and Reflections

A beautiful book I stumbled upon at the library. I didn't peruse all of it, but it left some thoughts marks about grief and loss on earth.
