# The Presentation of Self in Contemporary Social Life by David Shulman

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> The Presentation of Self in Contemporary Social Life covers the popular theories of Erving Goffman, and shows modern applications of dramaturgical analysis in a wide range of social contexts. David Shulman’s innovative new text demonstrates how Goffman’s ideas, first introduced in 1959, continue to inspire research into how we manage the impressions that others form about us. He synthesizes the work of contemporary scholars who use dramaturgical approaches from several disciplines, who recognize that many values, social norms, and laws have changed since Goffman’s time, and that contemporary society offers significant new forms of impression management that we can engage in and experience. After a general introduction to dramaturgical sociology, readers will see many examples of how Goffman’s ideas can provide powerful insights into familiar aspects of contemporary life today, including business and the workplace, popular culture, the entertainment industry, and the digital world.

> [!warning]
> It's a successor to the Presentation of Self in Everyday Life by Erving Goffman. I am reading this over its predecessor in order to get a contemporary take on the subject of self-presentation and impression management.
