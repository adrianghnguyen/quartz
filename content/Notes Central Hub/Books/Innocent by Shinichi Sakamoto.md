## Thoughts and reflections

This manga had been in my reading list for a while and [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|I'm glad]] I got around to it. The art is hauntingly beautiful, drawn in a shoujo-esque manner which contrats its stark topic: the role of death and executions within the fall of the monarchy of France and its subsequent revolution.

I do not consider myself weak-stomached but some of the tortures depicted made me queasy - intentional of course. We look upon such methods of execution such as écartèlement or the brodequins. It would be easy to distance ourselves, think of us as past such barbaric methods - yet torture and the death penalty within our 21st century is still among us. The manga does not shy away from depictions of gore, the violence of sex or perhaps worse of all, the depravity which can exist among humans.

Written as a tragedy, relationships are complicated, with one twisting ideals and values in order to suit one's self. The claws of the past follow us - we might seek a brighter future yet ghosts haunt us and string us along as puppets. Do we play a role within society - born in into a certain role? The French of the past sought to abolish the system of the Three Estates - clergymen, aristocracy and the commoners. The rich 2% pilfer and levy much to the burden of the layperson - leading to the eventual birth of the Republic. Yet even amongst those who lead the charge - twisted morals abound.

Are we so different here today? In our modern day? Who knows. It was fascinating seeing a glimpse of history - of the supposed birth of democracy - which sought to break the shackles of rigid castes - but has it really changed within our capitalistic structures where the barons of old are the billionaires of today?
