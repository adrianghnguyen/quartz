# Anxious People by Fredrik Backman

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> New York Times bestseller From the New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove and “writer of astonishing depth” (The Washington Times) comes a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined. Viewing an apartment normally doesn’t turn into a life-or-death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers begin slowly opening up to one another and reveal long-hidden truths. First is Zara, a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else until tragedy changed her life. Now, she’s obsessed with visiting open houses to see how ordinary people live—and, perhaps, to set an old wrong to right. Then there’s Roger and Anna-Lena, an Ikea-addicted retired couple who are on a never-ending hunt for fixer-uppers to hide the fact that they don’t know how to fix their own failing marriage. Julia and Ro are a young lesbian couple and soon-to-be parents who are nervous about their chances for a successful life together since they can’t agree on anything. And there’s Estelle, an eighty-year-old woman who has lived long enough to be unimpressed by a masked bank robber waving a gun in her face. And despite the story she tells them all, Estelle hasn’t really come to the apartment to view it for her daughter, and her husband really isn’t outside parking the car. As police surround the premises and television channels broadcast the hostage situation live, the tension mounts and even deeper secrets are slowly revealed. Before long, the robber must decide which is the more terrifying prospect: going out to face the police, or staying in the apartment with this group of impossible people. Rich with Fredrik Backman’s “pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature” (Shelf Awareness), Anxious People’s whimsical plot serves up unforgettable insights into the [[Human condition is our common shared experiences on this earth|human condition]] and a gentle reminder to be compassionate to all the anxious people we encounter every day.

## Thoughts and reflections

I started reading this book because someone recommended it to me when I was in a phase of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] %%[[The book train]]%%. It's a pretty funny book - whatever anxious thought just becomes absurd in such a context. I guess it's great to know that maybe life isn't meant to be taken so seriously.

"We're all just farting along and figuring things outs." Realistically - we don't need to do anything. Perhaps it's okay to not have a purpose but to live, breathe and defecate another day.

We are often prisoners of our own minds and perhaps it's worth looking at the world with humour because reality is odd in its ways. It doesn't make sense nor does it need to.

How happy am I to discover that one does not need to be alone in our thoughts - whether it be conversing with another or simply reading the written words. Think of mind-objects - perhaps we convey it through different means but can you read thought and intention behind it all? What is the symbolism of it all within the others' mind.

### Life is a comedy

While reading [[Anxious People by Fredrik Backman]], it strikes me how lonely we are in our thoughts yet we hide and bury them deep within us. Life is absurd and comedic in its manners. Perhaps all interconnected. And if we opened up a bit, maybe we'd realize that we're not so different after all and the [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|chronic loneliness]] we feel seeking our place in the world would be resolved by learning to be [[Love is the pursuit of our emotional home|lonely together]].

There are multiple ways of approaching humour - one approach which is rooted in subversion of expectations. Perhaps it's simply saying what everyone is thinking yet afraid to voice it. We look up to comedians because they sometimes help remind us that we're all bumbling fools. It's not meant to be coherent and when the curtains are drawn, perhaps we would benefit more from shouting from the rooftops that we're all Pagliacci's rather than pretending to be part of the audience.

If you can learn to laugh at life more often in its absurdity, and say 'oh that's fucked up' more often, perhaps more of our anxieties would fade away into the background. Just one bad day can cause us to spiral deep into distance from others. But can one laughter, one smile bridge that moment closer?

I understand that the story is allegorical and reality often does not mirror fiction (HUH?) but I think a lesson to be learned is that each little moment brings us closer to connection with the world in new and interesting ways.

Be kind be kind be kind. We're all fumbling along - no one gave us a handbook on how to be an adult anyways.
