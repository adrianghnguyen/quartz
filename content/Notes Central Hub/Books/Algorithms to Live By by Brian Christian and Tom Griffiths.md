## Atomic Notes

> Most broadly, looking through the lens of computer science can teach as about the nature of the human mind, the meaning of rationality, and the oldest question of all: how to live. Examining cognition as a means of solving the fundamentally computational problems posed by our environ meant can utterly change the way we think about human rationality. p.5
>
> In fact, human beings turn out to consistently confront some of the hardest cases of the problems studied by computer scientists. Often, people need to make decisions while [[Dealing with weakness|dealing with uncertainty]], time constraints, partial information, and a rapidly changing world. In some of those cases, even cutting-edge computer science has not yet come up with efficient, always-right algorithms. For certain situations it appears that such algorithms might not exist at all. P5
>
> But this doesn't make optimal stopping problems less important; it actually makes them more important, because the flow of time turns all decision-making into optimal stopping. p.29

The success of Upper Confidence Bound algorithms offers a formal just tification for the benefit of the doubt. Following the advice of these algo- rithms, you should be excited to meet new people and try new things-to assume the best about them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary. In the long run, [[Learned optimism is a skill|optimism]] is the best prevention for regret. p.45 as simplified minimizing regret algorithm. It's also a simplification of Gittins index and explains why curiosity is a precursor to flow. Dopamine rewards exploration.

Explore exploit algorithm and secretary problem. Think about that.
It's also why I'm trying to learn computer science and I need to grind the basic logic so I can eventually get to algorithms?

Really try to understand what are Multi armed bandit problems

Having instincts tuned by evolution for a world in constant f isn't necessarily helpful in an era of industrial standardization. p.54 why we need to override instincts at times and practice self awareness to determine if our strategy is working for us

More generally, our intuitions about rationality are too often informed by exploitation rather than exploration. When we talk about decision-
making, we usually focus just on the immediate payoff of a single decision- and if you treat every decision as if it were your last, then indeed only exploitation makes sense. But over a lifetime, you're going to make a lot of decisions. And it's actually rational to emphasize exploration-the new rather than the best, the exciting rather than the safe, the random rather than the considered-for many of those choices, particularly earlier in life. What we take to be the caprice of children may be wiser than we know. P.56 explore explore explore

If bubble sort is robust and merge sort is brittle due to noise, what is an antifragile algorithm?
