> "Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives" is a book written by Nicholas A Christakis and James H Fowler. In this book, the authors explore the influence of social networks on various aspects of our lives, ranging from our health and happiness to our political beliefs and behaviors.
>
> Christakis, a physician and sociologist, and Fowler, a social scientist, draw on their extensive research to provide insights into how social networks shape our thoughts, feelings, and actions. They argue that our social connections have a profound impact on us, influencing our behavior even when we are not aware of it.
>
> The authors examine numerous studies and experiments to demonstrate the power of social networks. They show how obesity can spread through social ties, how happiness can be contagious, and how our friends can shape our political beliefs. They also explore the role of social networks in the spread of ideas, innovations, and even diseases.
>
> In addition to providing a comprehensive overview of the science behind social networks, Christakis and Fowler offer practical advice for building healthier and more fulfilling connections. They emphasize the importance of understanding the dynamics of our networks and actively cultivating positive relationships.
>
> "Connected" challenges the notion that we are isolated individuals who make independent choices. Instead, it highlights the interconnectedness of human society and argues that we are deeply influenced by those around us. By understanding this influence, we can harness the power of social networks to improve our lives and create positive change.

## Thoughts and Reflections

This was a book provided to me during one of my social psychology courses. I don't exactly remember what I learned from it, but long story short is that the people we surround ourselves with have a deep impact on our lives, such as our romantic partners, our friends, and it manifests itself in very subtle ways ways, such as our diets/personal health or what kind of activities we decide to engage in.

So it's important to [[Choose social circles wisely|be selective in the people that we surround ourselves with]].
