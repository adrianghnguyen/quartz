# Bearing the Unbearable by Joanne Cacciatore

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> If you love, you will grieve—and nothing is more mysteriously central to becoming fully human.
>
> When a loved one dies, the pain of loss can feel unbearable—especially in the case of a traumatizing death that leaves us shouting, "NO!" with every fiber of our body. The process of grieving can feel wild and nonlinear—and often lasts for much longer than other people, the nonbereaved, tell us it should.
>
> Organized into fifty-two short chapters, Bearing the Unbearable is a companion for life's most [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|difficult times]], revealing how [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] can open our hearts to connection, compassion, and the very essence of our [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|shared humanity]]. Dr. Joanne Cacciatore—bereavement educator, researcher, Zen priest, and leading counselor in the field—accompanies us along the heartbreaking path of love, loss, and grief. Through moving stories of her encounters with grief over decades of supporting individuals, families, and communities—as well as her own experience with loss—Cacciatore opens a space to process, integrate, and deeply honor our grief.
