# The Book of Goose by Yiyun Li

## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> Long-listed for the 2023 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction. A New York Times Book Review Editors’ Choice A Slate Top Ten Book of the Year A TIME Best Fiction Book of 2022 Named a Best Book of the Year by The New Yorker, NPR, Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, Los Angeles Review of Books, Financial Times, San Francisco Chronicle, LitHub, Buzzfeed, and more. A magnificent, beguiling tale winding from the postwar rural provinces to Paris, from an English boarding school to the quiet Pennsylvania home where a woman can live without her past, The Book of Goose is a story of disturbing intimacy and obsession, of exploitation and strength of will, by the celebrated author Yiyun Li. Fabienne is dead. Her childhood best friend, Agnès, receives the news in America, far from the French countryside where the two girls were raised—the place that Fabienne helped Agnès escape ten years ago. Now Agnès is free to tell her story. As children in a war-ravaged backwater town, they’d built a private world, invisible to everyone but themselves—until Fabienne hatched the plan that would change everything, launching Agnès on an epic trajectory through fame, fortune, and terrible loss.

## Thoughts and reflections

### Shoes which are too small

I find it so fascinating that a book can present those two sides of the same coin. One was too gifted for the world, but was not given the opportunity to go out because she did not seek it. The other accepted the gift of her partner, and sought to be her arms and legs.

To be truly happy, maybe we don't need to be understood. We don't need to be someone else, to play a role.

### Passivity and agency

What does it mean to be to be a passive actor as Agnes? What does it mean to be a force of nature, as we see as Fabienne? Is it better to be the peoples' favorite doll, or is it to be misunderstood as a village pariah? But what happens when someone does and when [[Love is the pursuit of our emotional home|they complete you]]? We yearn and long for them. Will you understand me? Can you guide me? Can you feel for me? I find the relationship between the two girls admirable - perhaps one of the reasons why the book resonated with people is that we all yearn for such a deep understanding of another.

Fabienne has always understood Agnes. Jacques does. Yet in his preternatural wisdom, Jacques knew that this love could not last - we change through time. Only parallel railroads reach the same destination. Through Fabienne's plans and encouragement, Agnes became her own person, to have a better life, to learn to dream for herself. To emancipate Agnes, was that her ultimate expression of love?

### Exploits

Children are purely innocent, but perhaps because they don't think too much, they don't scheme. As adults, we turn inwards. Perhaps we are there to exploit, to see one's potential untapped and to convert it into one's gain. Relationships are inherently transactional, even in the best of ones - "what are you doing for me?" Now, I'm not cynical - I believe in the good of the world.

In my adulthood, I have read very few fiction novels. I am left with many questions - what am I seeking to exploit from this story? But maybe that is not the purpose of fiction novels. Perhaps their goal is to expand our feelings, to question things, to relate. Maybe I've become an adult after all - funny innit?

### Final thoughts

There are too many questions left in my mind. But I think I'll leave it unsaid for now. It was very surprising for me to go to GoodReads and people have a very different interpretation of the novel, to say that the characters were bland, or the plot did not mean much to them. Yet, I feel it is so rich. There are a thousand ways I wish I could dissect Fabienne, as well as their relationship. I think all of Yiyun Li's words were chosen deliberately and I could think about them for many days.

We are guilty of judging, to compare the value and worth. People drew comparisons to other stories, how it 'lacked this, lacked that' but does it really matter? Can you see the goose for what it is trying to dream and more?

## Quotes

> What’s the difference between knowing a story and writing it out? But the questions I should have asked, which I did not know how when we were younger, were: Isn’t it enough just to know a story? Why take the time to write it out?
>
> I now have the answer, for her and for myself. The world has no use for [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|who we are]] and what we know. A story has to be written out. How else do we get our revenge?

> I answered the questions with what the press later called _équilibre et confiance_. Me, Agnès? What confidence did I have? But I was lucky to have come up with how best to present myself as a child author: I was imagining a person who was half Fabienne and half Agnès, and I had no trouble stepping into the shoes of that person. A mysterious girl who had made up for her lack of education with good intuition—that was what the press needed to see.

> Childhood friendship, though it has to meet the same geographical and temporal prerequisites, is something rarer: a child does not seek to bond with another child. The bond, defying knowledge and understanding, either is there, or is not; once a bond comes into existence, no child knows how to break from it until the setting is changed. It baffles me that often songs and poems are written about love at first sight: those who claim to experience the phenomena have preened themselves, ready for love. There is nothing extraordinary about that. Childhood friendship, much more fatal, simply happens.

> “There’s nothing wrong with being like most people. But myself,” she said, “I don’t do things with any grand purpose in mind.”
>
> “For what, then?”
>
> Fabienne looked at me the way she would look at an injured bird before wringing its neck. All my life, no one else has looked at me with such tender pity. “I don’t think you understand,” she said.
>
> “Then tell me,” I begged. “What don’t I understand?”
>
> “The problem with you,” she said, “is that you don’t think much and you don’t feel much, so you’re easily amused and satisfied.”
>
> “I don’t think much because you’re doing the thinking for me,” I said.
>
> “Exactly,” Fabienne said. “I don’t mind thinking for both of us, but what can you do for me?”
