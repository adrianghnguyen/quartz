## Summary

Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning is a 2020 autobiographical book of essays using Hong's own experiences to support her arguments on the marginalized community feelings such as: shame, irritation, melancholy, and paranoia. Each of Hong's essays tackled different acts ofÂ [racial discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination "Racial discrimination").

## Highlights and Quotes

> In [[_MOC Psychology|psychoanalysis]], the pain that trolls our nerves detaches from your body once you talk about it. Naming that pain takes the sting out of the incident, makes it mortal, manageable, even extinguishable.
>
> But I grew up in a culture where to speak of pain would not only retraumatize me, but traumatize everyone I love, as if words are not a cure but a poison that will infect others.
>
> (*p. 156*)

> Already, "woke" is a hashtag that's now mocked, when **being awake is not a singular revelation but a long-term commitment fueled by constant reevaluation.** (p. 192)

> I was never satisfied with those immigrant talking points about "not belonging" and "the sense of in-betweenness." It seemed rigid and rudimentary, like I just need to find myself. But I also understand the impulse to search for some origin myth of the self, even if it's shaped by the stories told to us, which is why I keep returning to Seoul in my memories to historical fact that are obscure to most and obvious to few, to try and find a better vantage points to justify my feelings here. In Seoul, I still found myself cleaved, but at least it wasn't reduced to American talking point. at the least the "arsenal of complexes" that Frantz Fanon talks about was laid bare.

## Thoughts and Reflections

The book was a difficult read. I thought, why is she so whiny? So angry? It took time to digest the fact that this discomfort is the boiling rage that minorities feel but often fail to express amongst the greater discourse in order to maintain the image of the Model Minority.

I think the book was impactful because it covers the spectrum of emotions that lays underneath the blank faces of Asians as they get absorbed into the white majority. It's the first book which paints such a vivid portrait of the boiling pot of emotions underneath it all. There is a lot of anger and rage to be had. In the news, I can see some of the violence towards black people in America, but little do we hear of the violence and injustice of the Asian condition.

It's also the first book which explains where being 'woke' comes from ![[Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong#^7b3cab]]

I guess this book sheds a light the complexity of being Asian-American. It's not the perfect minority. There is hatred. There is anger. There is loss. There is the fear of being invisible.
