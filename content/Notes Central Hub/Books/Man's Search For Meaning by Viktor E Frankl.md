# Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl

> [!NOTE] Book Summary
> Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl's memoir has riveted generations of readers with its descriptions of life in Nazi death camps and its lessons for spiritual survival. Between 1942 and 1945 Frankl labored in four different camps, including Auschwitz, while his parents, brother, and pregnant wife perished. Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.

## Thoughts and Reflections

I remember reading this sometime during my university years - where I felt quite lost and was seeking to grasp at anything to find purpose in life.

It was interesting to hear how as long as one has a why - we can endure almost anything, even in the most bleak of situations. Many years later now, I think I'm possibly getting closer to finding my purposeâ€¦which is to build connections between people and ideas. I think my written article [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]] sums up this philosophy which I consider to be one of the most important pieces of literature I've written so far. Understanding the difference between attachment and connection helps me understand my little bubble in the world.
