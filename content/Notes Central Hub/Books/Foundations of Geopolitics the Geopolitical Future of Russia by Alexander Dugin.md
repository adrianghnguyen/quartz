## Thoughts reflections

As of [[2023-03-19]] I have not read the book. Yet it's been often mentioned as being influential in terms of how Russia performs its disinformation warfare campaigns and may have even helped elect Trump to presidency by sowing discord amongst the American citizenship. Will be interesting to read sometime.
