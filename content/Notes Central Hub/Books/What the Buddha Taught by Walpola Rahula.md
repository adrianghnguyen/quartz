## Thoughts reflections

This was a book lent to me by my friend %%[[Tim Vieregge]]%% who was influential in helping me build a  [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|daily habit]] of doing meditation check-ins. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions on what Buddhism is within the side, or at least I have learned a lot of new things. I think there's a lot of mysticism associated with its practice but the original teachings emphasize that it is not a religion rather being a way of life.

It is not something reserved for ascetic monks in the mountains only but rather was meant to be something taught for the common person. It emphasize purity of mindset rather than purity of environment.

As a wise person, the Buddha encapsulates many of my thoughts in much more eloquent words and difficult concepts. Was it perhaps the work and culmination of many bright minds working in concert and being abscribed to one (hopefully real) person? In many ways, it seems like proto-psychology. Even now, in some of my research, it seems like some of the preached mindfulness practices can be tied to Buddhist practices.

One way for which I believe I can become a better person is to learn how to adopt the [[Living a noble life according to Buddhism|Noble Eightfold Paths of the Buddha]]. One with which I struggle is to not speak ill will for others. It reminds me of [[Quotes to remember|the saying]]: "Great minds discuss ideas; average minds discuss events; small minds discuss people." There is little value in speaking in speaking poorly upon others.

I believe that the other idea to remember is that life is interconnected. A cycle of rebirth simply means that we are part of the nature environment. I'm not sure how to interpret it in a metaphysical way. Likewise, the Buddha also said that some metaphysical questions are not worth answering, or they are not important in grand scheme of things. Humanity is quite interesting in its way of [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|being curious]].
