## Book information

> [!NOTE] Book Description (Auto-Imported)
> The international phenomenon that has sold over a million copies in Japan, If Cats Disappeared from the World is a funny, heartwarming, and profound meditation on the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]]. The postman’s days are numbered. Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage to keep him company, he was unprepared for the doctor’s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can tackle his bucket list, the Devil appears to make him an offer: In exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, our narrator will get one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week… With each object that disappears the postman reflects on the life he’s lived, his joys and regrets, and the people he’s loved and lost. Genki Kawamura’s timeless tale is a moving story of loss and reconciliation, of one man’s journey to discover what really matters most in life.

### Thoughts and reflections

I think it's the first time that I ever cried reading a book, or at least a fictional one. It's interesting how the story began by asking us what do we gain when we lose something, and him about confronting his mortality or vice-versa.

I think the part which really struck me though is when I realized how much the book made me think about Patate %%[[Melodie Zhou|Mélodie Zhou's cat]]%% and my love for that cat with whom I shared part of my life. I now understand a bit more deeply about the unconditional bond and love humans share with their pets - which is perhaps the purest form of love one can share [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|universally with other people]]. Perhaps that is why they say that nothing can trump a [[Tran Huynh|mother's love]].

We're all small actors in the grand theatre of life. We all just hope that at the end credits, people remember us as having starred in their lives.
