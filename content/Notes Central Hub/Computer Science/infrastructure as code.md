## What is infrastructure as code?

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a technique which allows DevOps teams to scale cloud infrastructure. It works by telling the desired end state aka a declarative approach which the intermediary layer seeks to provide the necessary resources for deployment. This is a way of providing abstraction and makes workflows a lot more easy.

## Common infrastructure as code platforms

> [!ai] AI
>
> 1. Terraform - Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
> 2. Ansible - Ansible is an open-source automation platform that can be used to manage infrastructure as code. It uses a simple YAML syntax to describe infrastructure configurations and can be used to automate tasks such as server provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment.
> 3. Puppet - Puppet is another open-source configuration management tool that can be used for infrastructure as code. It allows users to define infrastructure configurations in a declarative language and can be used to manage both cloud-based and on-premise resources.
> 4. Chef - Chef is a configuration management tool that uses a powerful Ruby-based DSL (domain-specific language) to define infrastructure configurations. Like Ansible and Puppet, it can be used for infrastructure as code management across multiple cloud providers.
> 5. CloudFormation - Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides its own infrastructure as code platform called CloudFormation. With CloudFormation, users can define and provision AWS resources using JSON or YAML templates.
> 6. Azure Resource Manager - Microsoft Azure also provides an infrastructure as code platform called Azure Resource Manager (ARM). ARM allows users to define and provision Azure resources using JSON or YAML templates.
> 7. Google Cloud Deployment Manager - Google Cloud provides an infrastructure as code platform called Deployment Manager. With Deployment Manager, users can define and provision Google Cloud resources using YAML or Python templates.
