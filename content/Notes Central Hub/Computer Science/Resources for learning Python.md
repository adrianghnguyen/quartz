> Projects:
>
> Find something that'd help to solve a real world problem for you. For example, I'm on Linux and use the terminal for many things. I wanted a cli tool to do simple calculations. There'sÂ `bc`Â command, but it doesn't accept direct string and you need to setÂ `scale`Â and so on. So, I looked up how to write a cli in Python (I went with built-inÂ `argparse`Â module) and made a tool that'd solve my small use case.
