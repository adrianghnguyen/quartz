- Automatically deploying code to environments

> [!ai] AI
>
> Continuous deployment is a software engineering practice that involves automating the entire process of deploying new code changes to production environments. This process includes building, testing, and releasing code changes continuously and automatically, without human intervention.
>
> The goal of continuous deployment is to reduce the time between writing code changes and delivering them to end-users. By automating the deployment process, developers can quickly identify and fix bugs, improve application performance, and respond to customer feedback more efficiently.
>
> Continuous deployment relies on a combination of tools and processes, including continuous integration (CI), automated testing, and containerization. CI ensures that all code changes are tested thoroughly before they are merged into the main branch. Automated testing enables developers to run tests automatically on the new code changes as they are deployed to production environments. Containerization helps ensure that applications run consistently across different environments.
>
> Some benefits of continuous deployment include faster release cycles, improved quality assurance, reduced risk of downtime or errors during releases, increased collaboration between development and operations teams, and better alignment with business goals.
>
> Overall, continuous deployment is an essential practice for modern software engineering teams looking to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace while maintaining stability and reliability in their applications.
