## Definition of recursion

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function or [[Programming languages|procedure]] calls itself, either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem or perform a [[Computational processes|computation]]. Recursion is a powerful technique that is used in many programming languages and is particularly well-suited to problems that can be expressed recursively, such as traversing tree ([[Tree accumulation]]) or graph data structures.

Recursive functions typically involve a base case that provides a *stopping condition*, as well as one or more recursive cases that break the problem down into smaller subproblems.
