## Overview of blockchain technology

> Blockchain technology is a digital ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent way. It is like a database that stores information in blocks, which are linked together to form a chain. Each block contains data, such as transaction details, and a unique code called a hash.
>
> The use of blockchain technology is not limited to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. It can also be used for various purposes such as supply chain management, voting systems, digital identity verification, and more. For example, blockchain can help track the origin of products from the manufacturer to the consumer, ensuring transparency and accountability.
>
> One of the key features of blockchain technology is its decentralization. This means that there is no single entity or authority controlling the network. Instead, it is maintained by a network of users who validate transactions using complex algorithms.
>
> Overall, blockchain technology offers many advantages such as security, transparency, immutability, and efficiency. It has the potential to revolutionize various industries and create new opportunities for innovation and growth.

## Explanation 

%%to [[rebecca chong]]%%

Explaining it using cryptocurrency as its our most familiar use case as of today.

When you go into a store and you purchase something, we use something called double entry book keeping to keep things honest. You get a receipt, the store gets a receipt. That way both has evidence on each other that a transaction occurred.

Okay what happens if the store says, "nope - you never bought anything". It implies a level of trust because you have a receipt, but the store may not.

This is where blockchain in cryptocurrency comes in. Blockchain, within our metaphor, is that each person who has done a transaction IN THE PAST can say, yup Rebecca had enough money to purchase the thing. That's point one.

 So I could walk up to anyone in the store and say, ah okay Rebecca did buy something on that day (the level of precision and how it's recorded is more complex than thatâ€¦but handwaive it for now).

Point two is that okay, let's say your transaction went through and both parties shook hand. You are now the trust verifier (through the money you own) of future transactions in turn. It's turtles all the way down.

As of today, there's a whole set of dependencies within our banking system (central bank <-> individual bank <-> your bank account) which determines that you can buy something or not. Blockchain allows you to make it so that ANYONE who >participates< within the system becomes part of the verifying chain of custody.
