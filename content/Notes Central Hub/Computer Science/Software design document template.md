%%Shared with me by [[Tim Vieregge]]%%

## Why do I even have this?

This will be very useful as I learn how to better [[My personal project management process|manage my software hobby projects]]. I think that finding meaning and purpose is supremely important in terms of making goals relevant to us. 

I was discussing with my friend how I can learn to better frame my problems and avoid [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|analysis paralysis]]. I feel like having a certain framework, allows us to build certain constraints which allows us to focus our thinking. 

By the act of [[Writing is the medium by which we think|writing things down]], I can notice myself perhaps spiralling out of control trying to overplan thing. [[Good structure emerges organically|Good structure emerges organically]] and too much forethought isn't helpful as things will keep changing.

## Problem statement

What are you trying to do?

### Goals

What things will this software do? Very high level, keep it related to what you are trying to do

### Non-goals

Anything you want to remind yourself that you don't want to do. You don't need to fill this out at the beginning, you can just add to it as things come up

## Design

What's the thing you're building? All the major pieces and how they'll communicate

Some questions:

-   Where are you getting the data?
-   How does the data get between each part?
-   What are the major operations that each part will do?

## Rollout plan

How are you going to run this thing? What things need to be set up for this project to work? e.g. a linux pc, some data pipeline, a database server?
