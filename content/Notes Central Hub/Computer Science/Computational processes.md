- Computational processes are *abstract beings that inhabit computers*.
- As they **evolve**, processes manipulate other abstract things called **data**.
- The *evolution of a process* is directed by a **pattern of rules called a program**.
- People create **programs to direct processes**.

> In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells. Bless the Omnissiah.

**Programming languages** *prescribe* the tasks we want our processes to perform.
