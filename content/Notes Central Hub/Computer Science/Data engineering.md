## Creating clean data

What is clean data?
- Well-labeled
- Unambiguous
- Trustable


For [[Data engineering|data engineering]] to be successful, one requires good and clean data. This follows the principle of [[Garbage in and Garbage out|Garbage in and Garbage out]]. It seems like it also applies to fine-tuning [[Large language models produce human text using big data|LLM]] models in the sense that the training data needs to be of high quality and high performance can be achieved through well-curated datasets.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16zuccy/after_500_loras_made_here_is_the_secret/]

It seems that data stewardship is something that's thankless as a role but quite important - whether it be applied to analytics, [[Data engineering|data engineering]] or advanced [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] purposes like [[Large language models produce human text using big data|LLM]]

One tool which came up which can help in that purpose is [Cleanlab](https://cleanlab.ai/) - a tool dedicated to cleaning data using AutoML for text generation purposes. It's data curation for LLMs.
