## Video summary

source:: https://youtu.be/YQehg0uGBTY

- How advances in artificial intelligence ([[Artificial intelligence]]) are driven by understanding neuron modeling
- How the next generation of scientists are interesting in applying their knowledge through companies rather than staying in theoretical settings
- We can use machines, computers ([[Folder Computer Science]]) and robotics to understand our brains further
	- Similar to what is presented as a thesis within [[Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths]]. The brain's decision making can be modeled using math algorithms ([[Algorithms]])

Overview: This section discusses the potential of computer vision and machine learning to advance neuroscience research. It also touches on the challenges of data fragmentation and the need for conceptual leadership in the field.

**Data Sets**

- There are a variety of data sets related to neuroscience, such as cell sequencing, gene expression, and protein expression.
- The Chen-Zuckerberg Initiative has invested $3 billion to sequence every cell type in humans and animals.

**Neural Circuits**

- There is no consensus on what constitutes a neural circuit.
- Robotics may provide insight into how the brain works, as it can create cells and circuits that can solve variable problems.

**Multiplexing**

- Neurons can multiplex, meaning they can switch to do completely different functions depending on the context.
- Machines may be able to multiplex faster than our understanding of biology, which could help us understand what the brain is doing.

**Next Generation**

- The next generation of scientists is interested in solving practical problems.
- Bioengineering students think about problems differently than biologists, which can lead to more rational solutions.

Overview: This section discusses how some academics leave their labs to work for companies like Neuralink.

**Leaving Academic Labs**

- Some academics leave their academic labs to work for companies like Neuralink.
- This provides an opportunity for them to apply their research and knowledge in a practical setting.
- It also allows them to gain experience in the industry and develop new skills.
