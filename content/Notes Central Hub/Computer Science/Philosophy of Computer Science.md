- Computer science is not a science more so than a way to think.
- It is procedural epistemology - "the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects"

See also [[Lisp as a programming language]]

## What's the difference between imperative and declarative - esp. in regards to programming?

LISP is able to do both.

- [Example of imperative and declarative code](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQECZ9__XT2RkA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1639321694917?e=1683158400&v=beta&t=l6DQPU9MCPMaw5nuau1m7PN4LOsqCLC5VLEs-lgwSZQ)
- Imperative programming: We describe the exact (or **explicit**) steps required for code execution
- Declarative: We write code that **describes** the desired results
