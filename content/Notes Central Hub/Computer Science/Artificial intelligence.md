> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require [[Cognitive science|human intelligence]], such as speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving. AI uses various techniques, including machine learning, [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing]], and computer vision, to enable machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human behavior and data. AI has a wide range of applications in industries such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

Overall, artificial intelligence (AI) is an [[Interdisciplinary thinking|interdisciplinary field]] consisting of engineering, mathematics, psychology, and [[Linguistics|linguistics]], among others, to create intelligent systems that can perform tasks traditionally from an engineering perspective. On the other hand, [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] research fields on the other hand seek to understand [[Cognitive science|human intelligence]] aka [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognition]].

## Branches of artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a **broad and [[Interdisciplinary thinking|interdisciplinary field]]** that encompasses several domains, including:

- [[Machine Learning]]
- [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)]]
- Computer Vision
- Robotics
- Expert Systems
- Cognitive Computing
- Autonomous Systems

Based on my conversation on [[2023-11-11|Saturday November 11th 2023]] with my friend %% [[Suyuchen Wang|WongSoo]] %%, there are three primary families of technologies:
- Computer vision
- Machine learning
- [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing (NLP)]] which %% [[Suyuchen Wang|WongSoo]] specializes in as a PhD candidate%% 


It is closely related to the following other fields:
- [[Linguistics]]
- Ethics
- Neuroscience
- Cybersecurity
- Mathematics
- Environmental Science
- Business Analytics
