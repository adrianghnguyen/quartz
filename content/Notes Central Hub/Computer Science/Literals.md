Literals in programming refer to values that are directly specified in the code and do not change during program execution. For example, "hello" and 42 are literals in many programming languages. They are used to assign values to variables or parameters or as inputs for functions and operations. Literals can be of different types, such as strings, integers, floating-point numbers, boolean values, characters, and arrays. In contrast to variables or expressions that can have different values at different times, literals represent fixed values that are known at compile-time or runtime depending on the context.
