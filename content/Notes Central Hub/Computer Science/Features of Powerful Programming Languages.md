## Explained like a dummy

- Primitive expression -> They should allow us to play with [[Data|data]] at an atomic level (cannot be broken down)
- Means of combination -> We can combine these atoms of data to form molecules via [[Compound procedures|compound operations]] which are more complex
- Means of abstraction -> With the complex molecules, we don't have to remember the specific ingredient for the chemical reaction since we can abstract it via something like names (see [[Environments and names in computers]])

## Powerful programming languages formally explained like a computer scientist

> [!NOTE] The formal explanation
> Any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive procedures and should have methods for combining and abstracting procedures and data.^[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1]

Programming languages like [[Lisp as a programming language|Lisp]], serve as a framework for organizing our ideas about [[Computational processes|processes]]. I guess this is the [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|expert mentality]] applied to a programming framework itself.

Key Feature | Aspect |  Explanation
---|---|---
**primitive expressions** | which represent the simplest entities the language is concerned with | Numbers and arithmetic operations are primitive data and procedures like *atoms*
**means of combination** |  by which compound elements are built from simpler ones,  | Nesting of combinations provides a means of combining operations like *molecules*
**means of abstraction** | by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units | Definitions that associate names with values provide a limited means of abstraction like *chemical reactions*

Aka they should be able to manipulate data at the lowest level when decomposed.
