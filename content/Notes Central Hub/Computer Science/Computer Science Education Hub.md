## Teach yourself computer science

> [!task] This is it chief!
> [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
> This will be my primary education resources. Remember to [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|just do it]].
>
> Step by step of topics to learn which take 100-200 hours each.

### Overall curriculum

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Videos |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **[Programming](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#programming)** | Don’t be the person who “never quite understood” something like recursion. | *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* | Brian Harvey’s Berkeley CS 61A |
| **[Computer Architecture](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#architecture)** | If you don’t have a solid mental model of how a computer actually works, all of your higher-level abstractions will be brittle. | *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective* | Berkeley CS 61C |
| **[Algorithms and Data Structures](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms)** | If you don’t know how to use ubiquitous data structures like stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, you won’t be able to solve challenging problems. | *The Algorithm Design Manual* | Steven Skiena’s lectures |
| **[Math for CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#math)** | CS is basically a runaway branch of applied math, so learning math will give you a competitive advantage. | *Mathematics for Computer Science* | Tom Leighton’s MIT 6.042J |
| **[Operating Systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#operating-systems)** | Most of the code you write is run by an operating system, so you should know how those interact. | *Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces* | Berkeley CS 162 |
| **[Computer Networking](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#networking)** | The Internet turned out to be a big deal: understand how it works to unlock its full potential. | *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* | Stanford CS 144 |
| **[Databases](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#databases)** | Data is at the heart of most significant programs, but few understand how database systems actually work. | *Readings in Database Systems* | Joe Hellerstein’s Berkeley CS 186 |
| **[Languages and Compilers](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#languages)** | If you understand how languages and compilers actually work, you’ll write better code and learn new languages more easily. | *Crafting Interpreters* | Alex Aiken’s course on edX |
| **[Distributed Systems](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#distributed-systems)** | These days, *most* systems are distributed systems. | *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* by Martin Kleppmann | MIT 6.824 |

## Programming

I need to go through  [[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs second edition by Harold Abelson Gerald Jay Sussman]].

- Alternative book is [[How to Design Programs 2nd edition by Matthias Felleisen]]
- [Learn to become a modern Python developer](https://roadmap.sh/python)

### Steps to learn computer science

See also [[Folder Computer Science]]

1. Familiarize yourself with the basics of computer science: Start by gaining an understanding of the fundamental concepts in computer science, such as algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and operating systems.
2. Choose a programming language: There are many programming languages to choose from, but some popular options for beginners include Python, Java, and C++. Choose a language and start practicing writing code.
3. Take an online course: There are many online courses available that can teach you the basics of computer science. Some popular platforms for online learning include Coursera, edX, and Udemy.
4. Read computer science books: Reading books on computer science can help you deepen your understanding of the subject. Some popular books include "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell, and "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth.
5. Practice coding: The best way to learn computer science is by practicing writing code. Start small by solving simple programming problems and work your way up to more complex projects.
6. Join a community: Joining a community of fellow computer science learners can be a great way to get support and stay motivated. Look for online forums or local meetups to connect with others who share your interests.

### Additional resources for learning computer science

I'm only going to use these as secondary resources

- [computer science - Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/computer-science)
	- Provides a map of the basic lay of the land for computer science
- [Learney](https://maps.joindeltaacademy.com/)
	- How to learn [[Machine Learning]]
- [Computer Science | Everything I know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/computer-science/)from Nikiv which has a bunch of external resources
