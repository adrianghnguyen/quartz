## Definition of evaluation rule

> In computer science, an evaluation rule specifies how expressions are evaluated in a programming language.
>
> Evaluation rules define the order in which operators are applied, how functions are called, and how variables are resolved. Different programming languages can have different evaluation rules, which can affect the behavior of a program and the values that it produces.^[ChatGPT]
