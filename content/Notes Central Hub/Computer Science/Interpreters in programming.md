> In computer science, an interpreter is a program that directly executes source code written in a high-level programming language, without first compiling it to machine code. Interpreters typically work by reading each line of code, analyzing it, and executing the corresponding operations in real-time.
>
> The process of interpreting code involves several steps. First, the interpreter reads the source code and performs lexical analysis, which involves breaking the code into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, and operators. Next, the interpreter performs syntactic analysis, which involves analyzing the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the rules of the programming language. If any syntax errors are found, the interpreter will raise an error.
>
> Once the syntax has been verified, the interpreter will execute the code line by line, performing the operations specified in each statement. This process continues until the end of the program is reached or an error occurs.
>
> Interpreters are used in a variety of contexts, including scripting languages, scientific computing, and educational programming. One advantage of interpreters is that they can provide a more interactive development experience, allowing developers to test their code in real-time and receive immediate feedback. However, interpreting code can be slower than compiling it to machine code, which can impact performance for large programs or computationally-intensive tasks.^[ChatGPT]
