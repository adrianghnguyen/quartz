## Definition of procedure application

In [[Folder Computer Science|computer science]], a procedure application is the process of calling a function or procedure with a set of arguments, which are passed to the function for processing. Procedure applications are a fundamental concept in programming and are used to perform calculations, manipulate data, and control program flow.

When a procedure is called:

- the program temporarily suspends execution of the current code and transfers control to the called procedure,
- which executes its code and may return a value.
