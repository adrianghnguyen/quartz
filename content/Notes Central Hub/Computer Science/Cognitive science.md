# Cognitive science seeks to understand intelligence through scientific representational structures

#status/done

Related to [[Artificial intelligence]]

---

It's the scientific study of the mind (like [[Cognitive Psychology]]) and its associated processes ([[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world]]) drawing from multiple fields and their associated theories - quite interdisciplinary in nature. [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]] is an example of a designer turned cognitive scientist where he sought to understand where designs come from the scientific aspect of the mind.

They seek to understand the source of intelligence through representational structures of the mind. It is closely related with [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] which seeks to focus more on the engineering aspects of synthetic intelligence. See also  [[Artificial intelligence]].

Cognitive science involves various disciplines such as philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, [[Linguistics]], and anthropology. Cognitive science aims to create a theoretical grammar for these disciplines to talk to each other and synoptically integrate.

### Definition of cognitive science from wikipedia

> [!NOTE] Wikipedia
> [Cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes with input from linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science/artificial intelligence, and anthropology. It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of cognition (in a broad sense).
>
> Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform information. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include language, perception, memory, attention, reasoning, and emotion; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as linguistics, psychology, artificial intelligence, philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology.
>
> The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from neural circuitry to modular brain organization. One of the fundamental concepts of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures."
>
> The goal of cognitive science is to understand and formulate the principles of intelligence with the hope that this will lead to a better comprehension of the mind and of learning. The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s often referred to as the cognitive revolution.

## Why is cognitive science interdisciplinary?

- Philosophy did conceptual work on understanding the mind and cognition.
- Psychology studied behavior to understand the mind.
- Neuroscience studies how the brain contributes to behavior.
- Linguistics and anthropology help understand how brains link up with each other.
- No single level or discipline is sufficient for understanding the mind.

## Cognitive science seeks to understand how human intelligence operates

The key objective of cognitive science is to understand the nature of [[Intelligence as a concept|intelligence]] and behavior as from a biological [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|representation]] (like [[_MOC Neuroscience|Neuroscience]]). So they'll use things like algorithms ([[Algorithms]]), and principles of computer science ([[Folder Computer Science]]) in order to understand how the brain operates.

> One of the fundamental concepts of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of **representational structures** in the [[Consciousness is the state of being aware and alive|mind]] and [[Algorithms|computational procedures]] that operate on those structures.

The goal of cognitive science is to understand and formulate the principles of intelligence with the hope that this will lead to a better comprehension of the mind and of learning. The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s often referred to as the cognitive revolution.

## Cognitive science research fields related to artificial intelligence

Cognitive science is the *all-encompassing field seeking to understand human intelligence* with various sub-fields such as cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience and  computational neuroscience.

Cognitive sciences emphasize the human component while AI focuses on the engineering of synthetic systems.

Field | What is the field focused on?
---|---
[[Cognitive science]]  | **superset** of cognitive psychology which is more interdisciplinary in nature drawing upon fields like mathematics, computer science, psychology, anthropology to provide a more holistic look at [[Consciousness is the state of being aware and alive|cognition]]
[[Cognitive Psychology]] | focusing on the study of mental processes in isolation such as attention, memory, perception and reasoning.
Cognitive neuroscience |  cognitive neuroscience focuses on the biological basis of cognition
[[Computational Neuroscience]] | Attempting to model the brain using mathematical representations rather than experimental modes - unlike traditional neuroscience
