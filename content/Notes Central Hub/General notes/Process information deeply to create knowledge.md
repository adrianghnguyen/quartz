# Engaging in deeper cognitive processes promote higher level logical thinking and increases memory retention

#status/done

## Learning pyramid

According to the theory of [learning pyramids](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b87edf_e3ba99794af542e394b7a9895bb7c8a9~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_888%2Cal_c/file.png), reading ranks pretty low on how we can form knowledge. By summarizing, you are trying to engage in the higher retention level processes through teaching yourself (developing your own vocabulary) and engaging in a discussion process.

Do note that the learning pyramid has been misconstrued and misapplied in some education and workplace settings. It's important to keep in context differing needs of people as well as taking multimodal approaches fit to the content being taught.

## Collector's fallacy and information hoarding

As I started using Obsidian, I'm trying to be wary of the obsessions to read and collect everything (see [Collector's fallacy](https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Collector's+Fallacy#:~:text=The%20Collector's%20Fallacy%20is%20the,a%20type%20of%20cognitive%20bias.) ). I try and [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|be intentional]] as to why I am [[Digital Minimalism|consuming a piece of media when it is not for leisure]] and [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|how I think]] I will engage with the information associated. It's okay if I leave them as hypothetical threads, but the process of engaging your brain to form connections is almost the entire point of Obsidian which I think is lost by simply regurgitating someone else's words.

With that being said, consider using the summary as the foundation to add in your thoughts - this can be an effective way of processing the information.

Be wary of [[Passive learning is the acquisition of knowledge without putting it into practice|passive learning]].

## Semantic encoding

Higher level thinking processes depend on semantic retrieval processes for memory concerning word meanings. Our brains retrieve the related concepts in by drawing on pre-existing network neuronal activation connections in order to retrieve the necessary information in order to communicate.

 Semantic encoding "entails several cognitive processes such as perceiving a target word, holding it online in working memory, retrieving its meaning, activating related concepts and, depending on the task at hand, actively searching for concepts with equivalent meaning."'^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2525845/#:~:text=Semantic%20retrieval%20is%20a%20memory,for%20concepts%20with%20equivalent%20meaning.]

### "from Reference to sense: how the brain encodes meaning for speaking"

[Source](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/214#articles)

>  For concrete objects they are representations in our minds, of objects in the real world, constructed by the perceptual system. These representations are considered concepts, which thus are non-linguistic in nature. Sense, then, is that part of meaning that is encoded in the form of the utterance. In other words, sense (linguistic meaning) is the interface between the conceptual system and linguistic form (spanning both phonology and syntax; [Jackendoff, 2002](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00384/full#B14)).

> An essential step in this process is semantic encoding – the retrieval of the relevant concepts and the specification of semantic structure ([Levelt, 1989](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00384/full#B18)). In this step, the intended reference needs to be mapped onto a sense, for it to be expressed. In this mapping process, certain semantic choices have to be made, such as referring to the entities in the referential domain by, for instance, “the guy” or “the man on the chair.” From a processing point of view, then, reference forms the input to semantic encoding, while sense is the output. Semantic encoding itself is the computation necessary to map reference (the input) onto the sense (the output) in order to generate the appropriate output. In this paper, we consider sense to be equivalent to the _preverbal message_ in sentence production ([Levelt, 1989](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00384/full#B18)). The preverbal message is the semantic structure that forms the output of semantic encoding and the input to syntactic and phonological encoding.
