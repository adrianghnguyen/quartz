# Long-term change takes time and patience

#status/done

As I become older, I feel like I'm becoming a lot less impulsive and realizing that change is done through sustainable habits rather than forcing and cramming everything through.

Trying to do too many things at a time prevents us from making wise decisions for impulsivity, but as well, we lack contextual information, something we may not have considered. The flipside is that going too hard, too fast just creates [[Emotional and physical burnout|burnout]].

## We all hope to live 4000 weeks until our death

[[Richard Yang]] recommends the book [[Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman]]. He talks about the concept of time and how it is something that is constructed within the human mind. However it's interesting that the title mentions [[Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman|time management for mortals]]. Maybe it's silly and for a lot of people because the concept of mentality and I guess [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] is something complicated. As for me, I think mortality is something I had encountered  often and early in my life because bo [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]]  had passed away early on.

It makes me think of The Simpsons clip where Homer thinks he's going to die tomorrow or at least the doctor tells him that. So he lives the day like it's his last and is sobbing out in the parking lot. As for me I'm OK living day by day.  If I get hit by a car tomorrow or in five years or in 10, I just have to live with intentionality and just do the best I can every day. That means creating a balance between enjoying the time that we have right now and trying to do my best to improve towards the future. I think the goal should be self improvement but it shouldn't be the anxiety of feeling like we need to be somewhere we're not right now there's a nuance here.

In an interesting side note, I was wondering why I care so much about [[Urbanism]] and are car dependency within North American culture. It would make sense that with [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]] dying in a car accident that I have some kind of guttural reaction to cars.

Often they choose to _ignore the realities of war and **[[Target Fixation|hyperfocus]] on singular points**_ that they've landed on; effectively they make a conclusion and work backwards instead of the other way around.

As humans with our weak perception of the grand scheme of time, we probably are not well equipped to seek out happiness on our own. It's better to let it come to us.
