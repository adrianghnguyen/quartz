Advice from [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport|So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]]:

1. We think it's useless or bad for the environment or goes against [[My core values define what matters|our values]]
2. Few opportunities of development (a contrast to [[View challenges as opportunities|viewing challenges as opportunities]])
3. Have to work with [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|people we really dislike]]

Otherwise, we should apply a [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsman mindset]] and proceed with the job offer. Take the plunge and [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|just do it]]. We should see these [[View challenges as opportunities|new challenges as opportunities]]. I would be most excited to work for a company which I believe is [[Elevating others also benefits us|making the world a better place]].

[[2023-07-04]] Upon further reflections working in the adtech industry was not for me. I personally don't believe that promoting [[capitalism]] that heavily is within my interests or [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|personal values]].
