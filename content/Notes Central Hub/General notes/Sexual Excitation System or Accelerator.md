# Sexual excitation system or accelerator (SES)

#status/done

Related to [[Dual control model of sexual response]]

---

Our accelerator of [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual response]]. It works unconsciously constantly scanning the environment for what might excite us and relaying these signals from the brain to the genitals.

> It receives information about sexually relevant stimuli in the environment—things you see, hear, smell, touch, taste, or imagine—and sends signals from the brain to the genitals to tell them, “Turn on!”
>
> SES is constantly scanning your context (including your own thoughts and feelings) for things that are sexually relevant. It is always at work, far below the level of consciousness. You aren’t aware that it’s there until you find yourself turned on and pursuing sexual pleasure.

## Feelings leading to sexual arousal

When talking with women, these key themes of emotions emerged:

- Having an attractive partner who **respects** them and **accepts them** as they are
- Feeling **trusted and affection** in their relationship
- Being **confident and healthy**—both emotionally and physically
- Feeling **desired** by their partner, being approached in a way that **makes them feel special**
- **Explicit erotic cues**, like erotica or porn, or hearing or seeing other people having sex^[Graham, Sanders, Milhausen, and McBride, “Turning On and Turning Off.”]^[McCall and Meston, “Cues Resulting in Desire,” and “Differences Between Pre- and Postmenopausal Women.”]

## Sexual desire factors

See also [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood]] to understand what drives women to have more or less interest in sex and what affects their psychological states/interest towards it.

## Sexual problems tend to be related to the sis

People who struggles with [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension]] and desire problems are more likely to be related to the SIS ([[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake]]) rather than the SES.

> A common mistake made by people who are struggling with orgasm or [[Desire is arousal in context|desire]] is assuming that the problem is lack of accelerator; it’s more likely that the problem is too much brake.
