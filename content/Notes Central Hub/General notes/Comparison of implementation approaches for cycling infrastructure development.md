# Comparison of implementation approaches for cycling infrastructure development

These are various ways of city can approach building out infrastructure. It can be considered as a spectrum of options. We can think of it as complete grass-roots, hybrid or high-scale projects. There must be a better name for this type of mental model/framework but I don't know it at the moment.

This is interesting because I mainly knew about tactical urbanism - *courtesy of Reddit* - as well as traditional projects but did not know of the middle ground which existed. Montreal and a lot of other cities have been following suit so it's no surprise. I didn't know there was a specific term for this type of [[urban planning|urban planning]].

### Building political will

![[Pasted image 20230413231241.png]]^[TransitLink. (2022, November). Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver. (p.43)]

Building political will for change can be difficult. Often there's a lot of excitement in the beginning, so people will often approve. However, as a project is rolled out, you may encounter some difficulties where disapproval rates may increase as there is 'project friction'.

The best way of increasing political will when this occurs is to listen to users well, incorporate feedback and demonstrate incremental value/victories. This requires proactive engagement and monitor feedback of change impacts. It is important to ensure that vocal minorities do not dominate the conversation.

It is also important to get key decision makers %%as political levers%% on your side onboarded early into the process by explaining to them the nature of the projects, communicate your reasoning and explain how this will provide benefits.

Preparing people for possible pushback. (aka making sure they are aware of possible challenges) can be beneficial as people will not be caught unaware. Address current and future concerns. Anticipate and prepare risk management and communicate this.
