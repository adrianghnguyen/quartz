# Multitasking is a myth. Focus on a single task instead

There seems to be a common myth that multitasking is a sign of efficient productivity. There seems to be a wealth of evidence which show that frequent [[task switching]] is not effective as our brains need time to mentally adapt and engage the appropriate schema to the situation.  It's important to note that [[Mental cost of context switching|context switching has a cost on our ability to focus and think clearly.]]

As a result, we should seek to single-task instead. Our modern life encourages us to be constantly productive and chasing a thousand things at once. Perhaps it's worth [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|sticking to the essential aspects of life and keep it simple]].

Every time we multi-task, we need to make a decision which taxes our [[Self-regulation is a limited resource that can be depleted over time|self-regulation]] and [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|ability to make good decisions]]. This leads to inevitable [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]] as we seek to switch contexts.

- How do we define the relationship between [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]] and decision-making depletion? I propose the thesis that we can only make so many [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|decisions]] in one day in order to protect our decision-making energy reserves for important tasks which have meaning to us.
