We should [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|be charitable]] and recognize that we don't know the [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|full extent of their personal situation]].

Behind the scenes, we do not know if they struggle with body dysmorphia or have medical conditions which may have led them to be that way. Instead, we can celebrate the bodies' that we have. Photoshop, unrealistic beauty standards and various other cultural messages create a distorted view of what is a healthy and natural body.

For example, one of my friend %% [[Ryan CW Siow]] %% is obese as a result of being obsessed of being overworked and overstressed. They have struggled for many years to lose weight. Another friend %% [[Gordon Senkler|Gordon Senkler]] %% seems to be obsessed with having a healthy body to the point of excessive calorie counting because he was previously overweight. Although I am proud of him for his weight loss journey, they seem to talk religiously about their calories and food which they eat, perhaps to the extent that it is maladaptive by overcompensating.

As for myself, I am still on the journey of pursuing physical activities and learning what my body can do. It would be good to take the time to recognize the journey I've gone through so far. I would like to lose a bit more weight but I'm not obsessive over it. [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|It takes time]].
