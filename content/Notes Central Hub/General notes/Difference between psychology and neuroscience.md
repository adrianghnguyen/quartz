## Overlap of neuroscience and psychology

Neuroscience and psychology are both disciplines that study the human brain and behavior, but they approach this task in different ways and with different levels of analysis.

While both neuroscience and psychology study the human brain and behavior, neuroscience focuses on the **biological underpinnings** of these phenomena, whereas psychology focuses on the **psychological and social factors** that influence behavior and [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|mental processes]].

### Domain focus of neuroscience

Neuroscience is the study of the [[Nervous system transmits signals within the body and brain|nervous system]], which includes the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. Neuroscience seeks to understand the biological basis of behavior and mental processes by investigating the structure, function, and development of the nervous system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. Neuroscience employs a range of techniques including imaging technologies, electrophysiology, and molecular biology to explore the brain and its functions.

### Domain focus of psychology

Psychology, on the other hand, is the scientific study of behavior and [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|mental processes]].

Psychology seeks to understand the causes and correlates of behavior and mental processes by examining how people think, feel, and behave in different situations.

Psychology can be further divided into various subfields, such as social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, clinical psychology, and more. Psychology uses a range of methods, such as experiments, surveys, and observational studies, to investigate human behavior and mental processes.
