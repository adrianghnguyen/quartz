# Disinformation amongst GenZ

## GenZ Info Lit Study by Gemic

![[Presentation-Deck-Gen-Z-Misinformation-FINAL.pptx]]

[[Poe Han Thar Kyaw|Poe Han Thar Kyaw]] asked me how exactly we can help her become more data-driven for her interview with Stripe this upcoming [[2023-12-14]].

Based on her role, I would be thinking that the expectation from Stripe, and her research would be, how can other teams operationalize the insights and convert them to measurable actions such as [[Measure progress using KPIs|key performance indicator (KPI)]].

Suggestions
- Propose a framework for how one would conduct theoretical experiments to measure reduction in misinformation and increase information 'sensitivity'.
	- "How to reduce Genz illiteracy"
	- The better we can focus the goal, the better we can help talk about the data behind it. **What would we be aiming for?**
	- Right now, my knowledge of how information literacy, as well as the cultural norms of GenZ are lacking for me to provide enough of a strategy
- Give me 1 or 2 numbers to back things up. Turn soft claims into 'hard claims' that's backed.
	- Off the types of concerns (page 3)
		- How many sources of information do they consult a day?
		- As a proportion, how many are credible?
		- How often do people recognize misinformation?
- Are there opportunities to start building data points?
	- A/B experiment on 'natural suggestions' from Implications (slide 20)
		- How many clicked on 'People also ask'?
	- Three types of problems - three types of metrics (slide 25 - problems gen z encounters)
		- Can we measure these? You mentioned that people can swipe away.

## How to think with data

- What's my baseline? How do I measure an improvement?
- How can I capture the information as data?
- Does my data reflect reality? Is it a good enough proxy?
- When we start talking about demographics, it means we begin thinking in dimensions
	- Concept of dimensions, how do you want to slice the data? It's thinking about what kind of ways can you enhance things with your existing sources to discover new insights and segment further.
	- The concept of dimensions allows us to slice data we've collected at a more refined level to identify further trends
	- At Stripe, they have customer (personal, small enterprise, large) data, operational data, external data.
- Conversion funnels - how far along the journey do people go and when do they fall off?
