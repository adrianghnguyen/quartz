Happiness begins at a high level during early life, goes down during our mid-life and goes back up again later in our life according to the [[Scientific research on happiness throughout our lifespan|scientific research on happiness throughout our lifespan]]. We're just [[Understanding the complexity of life|along for the ride]].

Our happiness tends to be higher when we are a child, and it dips during our about mid 30s-mid 50s where it rises again. Do note that the point differential is relatively minor. If we think of a longer time horizon, consider the fact that [[Happiness is a homeostatic process|happiness is a homeostatic process]]. 

Maybe happiness can be found multiple times throughout our [[Many lifetimes to live|various lifetimes]]?

## What is the relationship between increased spending power and happiness?

He also talks about how people in their 50s tend to be happier. And I think an interesting aspect would be to study it from the perspective of wealth.

On average, white collar workers would be hitting prime spending power around that age which buys you a lot of freedom to enjoy and be satisfied. Hopefully your kids are off working and being happy as well so that's also a source of joy.

## With age we tend to exploit our sources of happiness

I believe this can be explained by the explore exploit trade off, or at least is part of the answer.

In the book [[Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths]], they present the concept of the [[explore-exploit trade off|explore-exploit tradeoff]]. When we are young, we have the tendency to be more curious and to explore more. However, as we get older, we tend to bias ourselves towards exploiting. This is because we realized that we have explored a lot in our lifetime, and we want to make most before we are faced with mortality.

In other words, we stop seeking out as much novelty, and we focus on what brings us joy. Think of your grandparents who always go to the same restaurant at 5:00 PM every single Wednesday.

## U-shaped happiness curve trend holds globally

In 2018, Jonathan Rauch wrote a book demonstrating research that globally, happiness follows a U-shaped curve with a squiggle at the end. After a drop in the middle age (related to mid-life crisis?), most people begin becoming happier again.

According to David Blanchflower from Dartmouth college, after analyzing trends from 145 countries and controlling for variables, this trend of life satisfaction holds true across the world.^[ [Is happiness U-shaped everywhere?

In the last portion of our lives, depending on the actions we have undertaken, our happiness can go up - a peaceful life.

### Interpreting the happiness scores

> The U-Curve of Happiness is a trend in social science literature that shows that the individual experience of happiness starts high in early life, lowers in mid-life, and rises again in later life, forming the shape of a U. Economist Danny Blanchflower of Dartmouth College seriously investigated the available data on countries across the world and found, “No ifs, no buts, well-being is U-shaped in age. The average age at which the U-shaped minimized across the 477 country-level estimates reported here is 48.3. It is in rich and poor countries.”

> The happiness scores computed in the study ranged from a high of roughly 2.85 to a low of about 2.61. Generally speaking, your age can be matched with the universal average from the study to give you a rough estimate of your relative experience of happiness. Use the percentiles in the table to interpret your relative happiness based on your age. For example, if you are 25 years old, the average happiness score is 2.69, which equates with the 60th percentile. That means you likely experience higher happiness than 60% of people between the age of 16 and 80.

> Because average scores are obtained from subsets of data, they do not constitute a universal predictive meaning for any particular person comparing their score to an average. Unlike a GPS that shows you where you are relative to a geographical area in absolute terms, these surveys have been designed by researchers like a compass to help you understand where you trend directionally. Remember, if you are lower or higher on a certain scale, the purpose of obtaining a score is to give you the knowledge that helps you move dynamically in the direction you want to go—it is not a final verdict for your happiness!
