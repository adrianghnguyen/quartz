> In Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child, psychologist John Gottman describes four different approaches a parent can take in responding to a child’s feelings: emotion coaching, dismissing, disapproving, and laissez-faire. I’ll refer to the last three (less supportive) approaches together as emotion dismissing.

> There are various types of approaches towards feelings, each with different attitudes and actions towards emotions. These approaches include emotion coaching, dismissing, disapproving, and laissez-faire.
> 1. Emotion Coaching: Emotion coaching is an approach that focuses on acknowledging and validating emotions. It involves actively listening to others' feelings, helping them identify and understand their emotions, and offering support and guidance in managing those emotions effectively. Emotion coaches provide a safe space for individuals to express themselves, without judgment or criticism.
> 2. Dismissing: Dismissing is an approach that involves minimizing or ignoring emotions. People who dismiss others' feelings may downplay the significance of the emotions or brush them off entirely. This approach often stems from discomfort with strong emotions or a lack of understanding about their importance. Dismissing can be detrimental to relationships as it invalidates the experiences and emotions of others.
> 3. Disapproving: Disapproving is an approach where individuals express negative judgment towards someone's emotions. They may criticize or belittle the person for feeling a certain way, considering those emotions as inappropriate or unacceptable. This approach can lead to feelings of shame, guilt, or resentment in individuals who are not allowed to express their emotions freely.
> 4. Laissez-faire: Laissez-faire is an approach characterized by a lack of involvement or response to emotions. Individuals following this approach often show indifference or apathy towards others' feelings. They may not engage in conversations about emotions or offer any support or guidance in managing them. While this approach can sometimes be seen as giving space for self-expression, it can lead to feelings of neglect and isolation.
>
> It is important to note that emotion coaching is generally considered the most effective approach towards feelings as it promotes emotional awareness, understanding, and healthy emotional regulation. Other approaches like dismissing, disapproving, and laissez-faire can hinder emotional growth and negatively impact relationships if consistently practiced.
