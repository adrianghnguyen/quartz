## Music is human pattern recognition

> [!quote] On the ethereal experience of music, as said by Michael Spitzer
> When you are absorbed in the work, you are *traveling back through layer upon layer of your brain*, almost biologically, which is why I call music a sort of umbilical cord back to Mother Nature.

Humans began walking 4.7 million of years ago. Walking is helping [[Mind-body connection|the body develop connections]] between our footsteps which is recognized as a pattern.

> [!question] Is the ability to predict merely advanced pattern recognition?

When we are able to predict what happens next, it reflects our human experience on earth. The ability of prediction may be an evolved apex predator strategy This ability to have foresight over our actions and their outcomes can be attributed to our advanced prefrontal cortex - the latest part of the brain to evolve.

### Dragonflies also use pattern recognition

The ability to predict is something also shared by dragonflies ([[Learning from dragonflies]]. However, we differ from those creatures in term of our decision-making center - they lack advanced neuronal connections so perhaps they have another mechanism of advanced pattern recognition.

### Music is a reflection of the creature's movement

Michael Spitzer notes that an individual creature's communication frequencies will reflect their movement pattern. Birds will produce higher frequency noise while whales work in a much lower register. ^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk] which is a reflection of the individual's creature motion.

Birds movements are jerky and erratic reflectin the properties of their chirps. On the other hand, whales float through water, having a much more fluid rhythm produce lower bass notes. Humans walking on earth are in between those frequencies with *our music reflecting our movement - footsteps*.

### Defining music as movement

Spitzer goes on to say that humans often describe music as something which moves us, the creation of movement. Physically, but also emotionally.

From an objectivist standpoint, music does not move - they are purely the physical movement of particles and their resulting interactions produce noise. However, humans brains are great at identifying patterns to organize this information([[Brains organize information into schemas]]). We perceive music as going between one note and another despite the fact that they are individual "atoms" ([[Nature promotes connectivity]]).

This perception of music as a series of notes being linked to one another ([[Gestalt Principles]], creates an imaginary sense of journey and resulting in symphony. *Human music is peculiar for our link between sound and motion.*

## Neurological mechanisms of music

Our brain's **motor cortex** (motor regions) are interlinked with our **auditory cortex** (auditory centers)"The deeper you dive into the human brain, the more universal one's propensity for music and for emotion goes."^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk].

### Brain components involved in auditory stimuli processing

> [!NOTE] Relationship between the brainstem and neuroticism
> One interesting correlation is that people who tend to score high on [[Neuroticism]] have a **greater startle reflex** - a propensity to have a reflex in response to a loud noise.

1. Our **[[brainstem]]**, the *oldest* layer flinches to reflexes in sound. So shocks and loud bangs will trigger the brainstem reflex.
2. The next layer up, the **basal ganglia**, responds to pleasure - pleasant or unpleasant.
3. **Amygdala** is next, which is where our emotions such as sadness, happiness, anger, fear occur and are processed
4. **Neocortex**, our most *modern brain add-on* is responsible for [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|processing]] the patterns involved in the complexities of music.

### Auditory scene analysis

> [!tip] Also known as the *cocktail party effect*

Humans even in a noisy environment, like a restaurant, with multiple ongoing conversations are able to 'tune in' to a specific *frequency* ([[Waves]]) of conversation. We use this same capability when we are listening to - honing in on a bar fugue, or jazz standard. We are able to focus on listening ([[Process of communication]]).

This is a capability shared by animals. For example, emperor penguins and their infants even when surrounded by the cacophony of other penguins are able to identify parent and child amidst the crowd.^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk]

Little aside - emperor penguins were one of my favorite animals growing up, being my subject of choice for a school presentation during the early grades.

## Benefits of music

Music is more than simply appreciating it as a form of relaxation ([[Practice self-care as a positive stress response]]) and entertainment ([[My hobbies and favorite activities|My Personal Hobbies and Activities]]) as it involves deeper cognitive processing than pleasure.

Music has the ability to being people together ([[The need to belong is the root of social connection]]) and you don't need to be physically present with someone else to feel this sense of connection ([[Nature promotes connectivity]]). It helps pull us out of our mental loneliness has the ability to improve our [[mental health]] ([[Practice self-care as a positive stress response]]).

On a philosophical level, notes are not alone - they are formed of social conventions and they are their own form of a social network.

### Neurological benefits to music

- It lowers stress by reducing our [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] levels within the body. What is the link between this and the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response cycles]] ([[Stress response system lifecycle]])?
- It floods our brains with neurotransmitters like [[dopamine]]
- It's a good way of encoding memories ([[Information processing theory]]) as it allows us to remember our past, express emotions ([[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart]]), identity ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]])

These result in a great increase in one's [[mental health]] which can be a conduit for mindfulness ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]]). It's more than mere relaxation, which somewhat implies passivity ([[Happiness requires action]]). Listening is an active process ([[Process of communication]]).

### Music is a complex language

This is more than language can convey due to its complexity. Even something as objective and precisely determined as mathematics ([[The impossibility of conveying objective truth]]) can be imprecise its ability to communicate without filters or distortion ([[Process of communication]]).

> "Music is more precise than words."^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk]

[[Writing to learn|Writing words]] is great but it is specific. Music on the other hand is free form, like [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|associative thinking]] ([[Associative memory connects unrelated items]]). Can we think of it as the comparison between the analogue and the digital? Maybe that's why there's an inherent appeal to record players and their perceived sound quality over the digital. Perhaps humans are wired to seek ambiguity over determinism. It fosters its own sense of curiosity ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]).

### Music drives mirror neuron activity and emotions

When listening to music, we tend to bounce along to music, a form of movement which we've established as patterns, and imitate its rhythm as a byproduct of [[Mirror Neurons|mirror neuron]] activity.

When we hear sad songs, our bodies are instinctively [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|sympathizing]]. "The sadness of the song isn't just acoustic, it's also encoding the behavior which we associate with sadness, such as [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]]. "^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk]

Music helps us get closer to our emotions ([[Human emotions have an adaptive purpose]]).

### Explaining the role of fear within music through frissons

> [!question] Frissons, and its neurotransmitter relationships?
> Is there a relationship between adrenaline (epinephrine) and this sensation of extreme sport? Within [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence]] we've established that dopamine is also in this process as a neurotransmitter.

When we experience musical *frissons*, music can feel intense and is triggered by breakthrough moments of loudness or extremity. This can result in goosebumps. This exact experience of mimics our brain activity patterns during fear ([[Fear]]). It's why we enjoy rollercoaster rides or seeing dangerous extreme sports. It's *violence without danger.*^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAafVviGxhk]

It is one of the theories as to why music is able to express emotions.

#### An aside on goosebumps

> [!NOTE] Scientific term for goosebumps
> The scientific term for experiencing goosebumps is called *piloerection.*

## Personal reflection

Within [[Dune by Frank Herbert|Dune by Frank Herbert]], the characters make reference to the dance/rhythmic movement which they need to perform when crossing the deserts of Arrakis to avoid the Shai-Hulud.
