Even after 120 years of research - we still don't have a robust theory of intelligence.

The current leading theory is [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences|Gardner theory of multiple intelligences]] as a result of brain imaging studies highlighting how we have distinct activation patterns based on the kind of intelligence being used.

Intelligence is defined as one's capacity to:

- Learn from experience thanks to [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]]
- Adapt one's self to their environment including sociocultural context.

## Personal reflections

> [!todo] Clean up this wording

is it one's ability to develop ideas on [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|the adjacent possible]]? [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]

the density of our neuronal connections?

when i fail to grasp a concept or having a [[Be succinct when communicating|succinct]] way of being able to describe something ([[Be succinct when communicating]]), it means im lacking in my [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]]/[[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handles]] and need to learn something

and id be constantly iterating over the notes itself and revisit them over time which is the basic concept of evergreen note, just like making a garden and taking care of plants

superior cognitive intellligence and the ability for reflection is one of humanity's core competitive advantages

a more intelligent creature is one which can improve itself through [[Feedback loop|self-reinforcement]] cycles.

Relate to [[La Douance -  Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et Cr√©atif by Marianne Belanger]]? It talks about intelligence types and various definitions of talent
