## Distillation of a mind-object

Words are but representations of a mind-object. Your underlying idea may be the same as the other, but through our choice of words, intonation, and cultural baggage or connotations. It's why we have an entire scientific field of [[Linguistics|linguistics]] to understand and make meaning of such things. Words are not mere text, but they are a distillation of more.

We are limited in our ability to transmit information - to fully understand a situation, one would need full [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|situational awareness]] and understand [[Dynamic systems theory|all potential factors within a system]]. Perhaps one day we'll be able to communicate using brain to brain interfaces, but that's a long way out.

Maybe world peace could be achieved that way, but perhaps that is being too much of an [[Optimism is needed for long-term success|optimist]].
