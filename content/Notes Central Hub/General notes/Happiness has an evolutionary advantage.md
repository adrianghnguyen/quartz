## Happiness has an evolutionary advantage

Modern scientific consensus helps explain why happier people have an evolutionary advantage. They tend to be more attractive as spouses, which makes us more likely in turn to produce children, allowing them greater odds of gene succession and reproductive success.

Happy people:
- are more desirable as friends and romantic partners, increasing their social resilience
- Live longer and live healthier

### Traditional evolutionary theory struggled to reconcile our struggle of survival vs our desire for happiness

Recently, scientists have been able to reconcile these two views of struggling for survival vs our desire for happiness.

According to [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Paul Zak]], the traditional view of an evolution is that our success metric is producing grandchildren - aka producing successful genetic offsprings who will themselves pass on our genes.

However, this produces a conundrum with our obsession of happiness, which is opposite to our struggle of survival.
