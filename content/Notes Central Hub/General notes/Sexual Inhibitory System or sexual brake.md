## Overview of the sexual inhibitory system

This is our sex brake or rather what tells us neurologically to not have sex/be turned on.

### Two main types of SIS sub-components

Research tells us there are **two main types** of 'brake' [[System Designs|systems]] which are similar to the inhibitory system within the [[Central Nervous System|CNS]]:

Type of anxiety | Concept | Explanation
---| --- |---
External fears | Environmental threat scanner | Listens for potential threats (STI, social consequences, unwanted pregnancy, etc.) within the environment as [[Priming effects|stimuli]] and acts in real time. It's the primary system inhibiting our sexual excitement during everyday [[On the importance of rituals and routines|routines]]
Internal fears | Fear of performance failure |  A chronic and low level inhibition signal similar to a hand brake which serves more as a modulator for our sex excitement rather than completely shutting it down

Behavioral strategies for dealing with these two systems tend to be similar.

If we constantly see these types of threats, our [[Sexual desire is spontaneous or responsive and everything in between|sexual arousal]] would be shut down ([[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges]]).

### Sources of sexual inhibitors or brakes

These are the findings^[Graham, Sanders, Milhausen, and McBride, “Turning On and Turning Off.”] concerning women's mental turnoffs which would lower their [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual arousal]]. I would assume it also applies to men.

> [!quote] Key themes identified by the survey
> • **Feelings About One’s Body.** “It’s much easier for me to feel aroused when I’m feeling really comfortable with myself … it’s not as easy to feel aroused when I’m not feeling good about myself and my body.”
> • **Concerns About Reputation.** “Being single and you know, wanting to be sexual with another person and thinking ‘okay, am I going to be too much?’ or ‘am I going to be not enough?’ or ‘what are they going to think of me because I’m doing these things?’ …”
> • **Putting on the Brakes.** “I think it’s like you might have some inclinations and then you’re like, ‘wait a minute, you can’t do that,’ you’re in a relationship or that guy’s a loser … and all of a sudden you just think ‘okay, fine, forget it, I can’t. That’s a bad idea,’ and just walk away from it.”
> • **Unwanted Pregnancy/Contraception.** “Unwanted pregnancy is a big turn off and if you’re with a partner who seems unconcerned about that, then it really feels like a danger.”
> • **Feeling Desired Versus Feeling Used by Partner.** “I like it when men caress not only, like, your body parts that get [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexually aroused]] but just, like, your arms … it feels like he’s encompassing you and appreciating your whole body.”
> • **Feeling “Accepted” by Partner.** “Even with my second husband, and we were together 16 years, he was not accepting of my sexual responses … I make a lot of noise or with my favorite way to orgasm, he felt left out … That was just the beginning of just really shutting down.”
> • **Style of Approach/Initiation and Timing.** “His ‘game’ … you know, how the man approached you, how did he get me to talk to him longer than like, five minutes? … It’s the ways he went about it.”
> • **Negative Mood.** “If you’re very upset with your intended sexual partner, if you’re very upset with him about something, there’s no way that you are going to be aroused.”

## Reducing sexual brakes

It's interesting because some of these key themes are the inversion/opposite of [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|SES signals aka turn-ons]]. I guess it's why it's so important to understand the roots of our [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame]], practice safe sex, have [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]] with our partners and manage our moods ([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]). Talking out our relationship problems would also be important.

- Practice [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]]

### Common anxieties concerning sexual function

> - Unless things are 'just right' it is difficult for me to become sexually aroused
> - If I am worried about taking too long to become aroused or to [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension|orgasm]], this can interfered with my arousal
