Deliberate and emotional | Typically occurs within experts in a domain - current research seems to correlate a moderate link to [[Neuroticism]])
Spontaneous and cognitive | Stems from a place of intrinsic motivation, common during childhood - weak link to mental health correlations
Spontaneous and emotional | Common during childhood and early learning - most likely no mental health correlations

We can think of this as a pyramid with the lower levels being lesser forms of creativity ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]]).
