# Manage attention proactively

The practice of controlling your attention is called attention management. Attention is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. [[Self-regulation is a limited resource that can be depleted over time|Decisions are psychologically burdensome.]] It is a [[Think strategically|strategy]] to increase our personal productivity.

> Attention management refers to the ability to control and optimize one's focus and attention. It involves various strategies and techniques to prioritize tasks and minimize distractions. Effective attention management allows individuals to stay focused, be more productive, and achieve their goals. It involves practices such as time blocking, setting priorities, minimizing interruptions, and practicing mindfulness.

## Factors which impact our ability to manage attention

1. **Your schedule**. [[Context switching when transitioning between tasks|Context switching]] happens when your schedule is either too full (too many things to work on) or too empty (not enough structure to stay focused). We're simply too busy doing things.
2. **[[Daily habits consist of daily actions|Habits]]**. Most of us have built a habit of [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|task switching]] through how we use work tools like email or chat.
3. [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits|Routines and rituals]]. There are also unconscious actions you take throughout the day that cause you to switch.

## Strategies for attention management

These are all strategies aimed to reduce [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]], avoid [[task switching]] and context switching. We should seek [[Reduce mental load through cognitive offloading strategies|cognitive offloading strategies to reduce mental load]] such as the extensive use of [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|mental aids]].

1. Batch and time-block your schedule to create clearer ‘focus boundaries’. You can dedicate that entire chunk of time to doing a particular type of work.
2. Create ‘themed’ Days to split your week between focus and flexibility. For example, meeting day, financial day, free days, buffer days, etc. It's timeblocking but on a day level.
3. Build a habit of [[Multitasking is a myth|single-tasking]] throughout the day
4. Add in [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits|routines and rituals]] that reduce [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]]
5. Batch similar tasks together. It's like an assembly line and reduces our [[Mental cost of context switching|mental cost of context switching]]
6. Build routines and rituals for when you need to switch into hard task. They serve as interludes/mental breaks when switching 'modes of work'.
7. Mute notifications and emails. Create time slots where you will choose to respond to those. Prioritize what to respond to. Create priority channels for messages and establish clear SLAs of response times.
8. Use [[Ad-blocking technologies|ad-blocking]] where possible.

## Create a ritual to end the work day

It's important to have have a ritual for the end of day to shift away our mind from work. Otherwise, we may simple [[Use harmonious passion to find greater happiness|become obsessed]] and have work constantly on the mind. Close out the work day with an after-work ritual.

[[Deep Work by Cal Newport]] has a few strategies for helping you master the shift from work to non-work mode.

> “If you strictly follow this after-work routine, you’ll soon discover that not only are you working harder when you work, but your time after work is more meaningful and restorative than ever before.”
>
> 1. **Record your progress.** Start by acknowledging what you accomplished–hours worked, tasks completed, time spent on Focus Work. Your RescueTime dashboard will show you all of these stats _down to the minute_. 
> 2. **Organize any uncompleted tasks.** Put everything in a place so it won’t pull at your attention. This could mean adding to [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|your to-do list, updating your calendar, or setting reminders.]]
> 3. **Glance at the week ahead.** Take a second to make sure there’s nothing big on the horizon you’re forgetting. The goal is to convince yourself that you don’t need to ‘check in’ later when you’re trying to relax. 
> 4. **Acknowledge that the day is over.** Do something to signal that you’re finished for the day. This could be closing your laptop and putting it away or even saying the words ‘shutdown complete’. Think of this as another ritual.
