## Gratitude stimulates positive feelings

Researchers according to [[REF An Antidote to Dissatisfaction|REF An Antidote to Dissatisfaction]] discovered that gratitude stimulates [[Brain reward or enjoyment system releases dopamine|areas in the brain responsible for reward feelings]], forming social bonds, and interpreting others' intentions.

Gratitude also aids in storing and recalling positive memories. Moreover, it directly negates negative feelings and traits like envy, narcissism, cynicism, materialism, and [[Social comparison|social comparison]].

People who foster gratitude typically report greater happiness, satisfaction, relationship quality, and resilience.

### Gratitude is a positive emotional insulator for mental health

[[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|People who are more grateful]] are less susceptible to depression, addiction, burnout, and traumatic events.

As a result, practicing gratitude is a key ingredient in engaging [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|the Hope circuit]] and helping us [[Dealing with mental illness|managing mental illness]].

## Gratitude allows recall of positive memories

When we are grateful, we can use our memories to recall moments of happiness.

When you relive memories of grateful moments, you are transported in time to that fleeting moment of happiness through reduced [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol production, the stress hormone]] production in the hypothalamus according to [[REF Choose to Be Grateful. It Will Make You Happier.|Choose to Be Grateful. It Will Make You Happier.]]

> One way of bolstering positive emotions is to reminisce about past positive events. Indeed, *autobiographical memories can bring back emotions tied to the original experience* [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719713/#R6). Retrieving positive memories in particular may be intrinsically valuable, by re-kindling pleasant feelings and engaging neural circuitry involved in reward-processing (e.g., striatum) [7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6719713/#R7).

As a result, we should look at it as any other skill: [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|gratitude is a skill which can be practiced]].

## Gratefulness may have evolved from mechanisms of reciprocity

According to [[REF An Antidote to Dissatisfaction|REF An Antidote to Dissatisfaction]], gratitude may have evolved to help us as a successor to feelings of reciprocity which would serve as a biological signal for organisms to exchange items for mutual benefits, something observed in nature and other animals.

Gratitude encourages us to repay kindness which allows fostering of caring relationships with others and allowing us to [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|strengthen them when we engage in reciprocity]].

### Gratitude is an evolutionary advantage for general society participation

As humans have evolved (link to evolutionary psychology?) to read other's emotions, those who were selfish would have been identified and ostracized from general society.

As a result, those who are able to to engage in more gratitude, repaying kindness to others would seem to have a greater evolutionary advantage in societal success.

Would that explain why [[Research demonstrates that happiness can lead to success|happier individuals experience more success]]? Being happier allows us to be more benevolent and engage in further reciprocation, allowing us to build a stronger social support network.

## Other notes

One therapy technique which takes advantage of these types of the reconstructive nature of memory is EMDR. It serves to re-construct memories with new semantic meanings with the help of our more mature knowledge, gained from later experiences, maturity or therapeutic insights.
