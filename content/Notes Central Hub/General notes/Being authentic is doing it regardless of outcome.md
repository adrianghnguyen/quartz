# Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome

#status/done

Would you still do it regardless of outcome? That's a good question to ask ourselves. Authenticity is achieved through the harmony of our behaviours and values.

Learning to become authentic is a journey which involves self-discovery of my [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]], acceptance and compassionate curiosity rather than self-accusation. It's about [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|being kind to myself]] and understanding that there are fears and emotional stressors which prevent me from acting as my [[The true and false self|True Self]]. According to [[REF Find Your True Self When You Feel Lost, Authenticity  Dr. Gabor Gabor Mate|Find Your True Self When You Feel Lost and Authenticity by Dr. Gabor Mate]], it's recognizing that [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|source of stress]] stems from unsuccessful accept to conform to others' expectations (real or perceived?) which leads to a disconnection from our [[The true and false self|true identity]]. 

Reclaiming [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal agency to shape my own future]] is part of making authentic decisions.
