Sleep hygiene refers to the [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|habits]] and surrounding behaviours around personal sleep schedules. Having a [[Sleep is important|proper sleep]] schedule is incredibly important to [[Sleep is important|be well-rested]] and plays a strong important role in [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional self-regulation]].

I feel that when I become less stressed and use my CPAP, my sleep routine tends to fix itself and I tend to fall asleep at a more regular time rather than in the early days of the morning. I think it's because there is lot of [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts]] preventing me from sleeping.

## Sleep patterns are natural fluctuations in sleep and wakefulness

> Sleep patterns refer to the natural daily fluctuations in an individual’s sleep and wakefulness. They are regulated by a combination of biological rhythms, external factors, and individual lifestyle choices. Understanding sleep patterns is essential for maintaining healthy sleep habits and optimizing one's overall well-being.

Having good sleep patterns involves having regularity in sleeping timing, consistent sleep duration and sufficient sleep quality. Maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is important to help to synchronize our body's internal clock, the circadian rhythm, to improve our sleep quality and overall alertness during sleep hours

## Personal reflections for improving my sleep hygiene

I am starting to get a better sense on my bio rhythm and feel like I tend to get sleepy around 11am. It's a subject I've discussed at length of my therapist and I believe that when I have a clear mind, it's a lot easier for me to fall asleep.

The question is that it can often be difficult to know what's exactly bothering on my mind. It's a common symptom to just have racing thoughts. Right now I am trying to [[Habit tracking|track this habit]] and [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gather data]] the context of my behaviour.

### My sleep patterns and schedule

| ------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10pm   | Sometimes fall asleep for bedtime | I guess that's a good time to go to bed around                                                                                                         |
| 3pm    | Post lunch sleepiness             | Tougher if there's work to do. The best solution I found is to fight through it and do something                                                       |
| 3am    | Occasional wakeup                 | I can't tell if this is a good thing or not. I think it occurs when I slept in the afternoon. I do find myself being productive at this time at times. |
| 9-10am | Natural wake up time              |                                                                                                                                                        |
