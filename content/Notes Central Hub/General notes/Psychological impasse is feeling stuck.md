# Psychological impasse is feeling stuck

Psychological impasses are the feeling of emotional flatness, and a feeling of no direction in life.

It can stem from the past, or shock to our ego (loss of [[Self-confidence|self-confidence]]) or can be caused by a crisis at work. A cycle of confidence, to a valley of inertia. It's important to recognize that emotional flatness is a form of [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feeling which indicates the existence of a threat]]. Perhaps we are living an [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|living an inauthentic life]] or circumstantial factors are not right.

The important thing is to recognize that something is wrong - so we can begin doing something about it. It is also an opportunity to make the most of it by [[View challenges as opportunities|growing through the difficulty]] by [[Stages involved in behavioral change|changing our patterns of behavior]].

## How to tell if you are stuck

Often times, we wonder if we are stuck - trapped in a loop of [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]]. A commenter put it really well: "When it comes to our story and healing, write often and edit well". The quick [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|heuristic]] to ask ourselves

> Are you telling yourself the same story? Or are you adding in new colours to your painting?

It can sometimes feel frustrating to be returning to the same place of [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional suffering]] but it can be different - we have become wiser, with further experience and perhaps a new perspective on the problem. Are you using the same wording or are you willing to challenge your [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions]] with [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|new ones which are more beneficial]]?

[[Being patient leads to better decisions|Be patient with yourself]] and don't forget to practice [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-kindness]]. You don't have to change your world alone - seek the ones around you to support you.

## Psychological impasse is not a personality trait

It's important to recognize the feeling of psychological impasse and that it is inherently part of a cycle. It is *something you go through* rather than 'something you are'. It does not make up her identity and is more of an emotion. So practice [[Being patient leads to better decisions|being patient with yourself]].

We will know implicitly what needs to happen next: through a 'hunch', physical sensation, unformed thoughts or feelings. The first task is to extract key themes from these thoughts and make meaning of it.

[[Journaling is healthy|Journaling]] and [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] may prove to be useful self-help tools.
