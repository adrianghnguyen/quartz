# Setting boundaries clearly allows us to be ourselves

> Clear is kind, unclear is unkind.^[https://brenebrown.com/articles/2018/10/15/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/]

## Boundaries are an act of self-care

Setting a healthy boundary is like someone waving you over to come see them but saying that you are okay with looking from afar from over there. It's also a way of informing others of our [[Personal needs as a human being|personal needs]].

It's saying that you are comfortable with your position but also acknowledging theirs. It's a way to pursue authentic relationships. It's also okay to recognize that others have their own personal boundaries due to their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique personal gardens]].

## Having boundaries is an act of self-respect

> Boundaries are self-respect, self-care, and self-preservation. They protect your energy and allow you to invest it in relationships where you can get the reciprocity you need.

> It's not about being "mean" or "giving up" on people, it's about acknowledging your own value and needs.

Having boundaries does not make you [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|a bad person]] - it simply means that you need to [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|treat yourself with kindness]] and respect that your [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|energy may be limited]]. It's about [[Self-respect|self-respect]].

### How to create healthy boundaries

- [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|Clear communication]] with the other person
- [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|Introspection]] to own your [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|center of emotions]]
- Practicing [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|empathy]] and recognizing the others' position
- Communicate our [[Personal needs as a human being|personal needs]]

#### Ask how would my models of friendship set an emotional boundary?

It can be difficult for me to know how to communicate some complex feelings without feeling a sense of resentment and hurt. At that time, it may be useful to think of how would another friend approach it.

For example, I think of my friend %%[[Lei Lopez|Lei Lopez]]%% who is very good at [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|naming her feelings]] and telling others when she's not cool with it. Practicing acceptance and acknowledging your feelings is key in order to determine your next steps in order to re-establish [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional equilibrium]].

Is there a way I can [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|communicate my emotional boundaries with kindness]]?

### Unhealthy personal boundaries arise from personal difficulties

> They may lack self-confidence, a sense of purpose, or a clear identity to guide them through life. Counselor [Dr. Dana Nelson writes](http://www.dananelsoncounseling.com/blog/self-care-setting-healthy-boundaries/), “in work or in our personal relationships, poor boundaries lead to resentment, anger, and burnout.”^[https://www.scienceofpeople.com/how-to-set-boundaries/]

## The forms of personal boundaries

> Boundaries can take many forms. For example, you could limit how much time you spend with her, or make sure that conversations with her are more surface-level and less emotionally intense.
>
> You could decide not to share certain information with her that you feel is too vulnerable or personal, or establish some rules around how you expect to be treated by her.
>
> Boundaries are ultimately about protecting your emotional health and energy, and making sure that you're not overextending yourself. Is that making sense?
>
> A lot of my friends feel like they've frozen off their relationship with their parents %%like [[Tran Huynh|my mom]]%%. I see it as a point of pride that I can engage in such conversations. Would it feel like I am giving up on all of this?
>
> That's a really interesting point, and it speaks to the complexity of familial relationships. Just because you want to set some boundaries, it doesn't mean you're "giving up". You can still value the relationship and the work you've put into it, while also making sure that you're not over-extending yourself emotionally. Perhaps you could consider it not as "giving up", but as "pruning" the relationship so that it can flourish in a healthy way. Do you see the difference?

## Reflections on setting healthy boundaries

Sometimes, I may be [[Perfectionism|expecting too much]] which is not such a nice thing to do. I should not expect people to read my mind, as a result, I should learn to communicate with honesty.

Of course, we should consider proper [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|boundaries]], ours ends where the others' begins.
