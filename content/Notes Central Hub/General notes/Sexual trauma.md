## Overview of sexual trauma

Many women have experienced sexual [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] to the extent that talking about their sexual health/sexual wellbeing is intertwined. In general, men have less problems than women when it comes to this particular issue.

Unwanted sex is is a form sexual trauma as it teaches the survivors' body that it shouldn't escape or fight. Freeze becomes the [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|default sexual stress response]] because it's the [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|learned behaviour]]. Sexual trauma tends to be pervasive and constantly pop up during our emotional experiences.

> Given the prevalence of trauma of all kinds, especially sexual trauma—a conservative estimate is that one in five women is sexually assaulted in her lifetime, and it could be more like one in three^[The World Health Organization reports that “35 percent of women worldwide have experienced either intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime” (WHO, “Violence Against Women” fact sheet). The US National Criminal Justice Reference Services reports that about 18 percent of women in America are raped in their lifetime; about 25 percent are raped, assaulted, or physically abused by their partner in their lifetime, compared with 8 percent of men (US Department of Justice, Full Report).]—it’s impossible to talk about women’s sexual health without spending some time discussing trauma. From child sexual abuse to sexual assault to all forms of interpersonal violence, women are disproportionately and systematically targeted, and thus they disproportionately bring to their sexual functioning the emotional, physical, and cognitive features of a [[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|trauma survivor]].
