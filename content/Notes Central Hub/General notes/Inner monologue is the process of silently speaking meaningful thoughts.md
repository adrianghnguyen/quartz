> Inner speech is defined as the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts without producing sound or body movement. It involves specific words, often resembling spoken language, and is distinct from visualization or emotional experiences. The video emphasizes that inner speech is a complex phenomenon that has been challenging to define and measure accurately due to its internal nature.

Interestingly enough, our inner voice is often cruel but there are strategies we can use to [[Dealing with our inner critic|deal with our inner critic]].

## Internal human dialogue is often negative or cruel

See [[Dealing with our inner critic|Strategies for dealing with our inner critic]]

A negative inner voice increases chronic stress. It's important to remember that [[You are not your inner critic|You are not your inner critic]]. When the chatter takes a turn for the negative, such as [[Dealing with our inner critic|a negative inner voice]] becoming [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]], it can negatively impact our ability to focus and make decisions, increase tension and conflicts in personal relationships, bring down our emotional well-being and ruin our physical health.

These factors can lead to an increase in [[Types of stress|chronic stress]] and associated health issues.

## Scientific research of inner speech and internal dialogue

### Research methods for inner speech

> Another theme discussed is the methods used to study inner speech. The video highlights the difficulties researchers face in studying internal experiences. Various research methods have been employed, including prompts, questionnaires, and Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES). These methods aim to uncover the prevalence, content, and patterns of inner speech. The DES method, which involves participants recording their thoughts when prompted randomly throughout the day, has provided valuable insights into the frequency and nature of inner speech, shedding light on the fact that it occurs on a spectrum and is not constant.

### Inner speech helps humans solve problems

> Conversations, Self-Regulation, and Cognitive Processes
> The content and functions of inner speech constitute another significant theme. The video notes that inner speech often revolves around self-regulation, problem-solving, planning, time management, and motivation. It suggests that inner speech may stem from childhood experiences and caregiver interactions, as people tend to replay conversations they had out loud as children. This conversation-like quality of inner speech might be attributed to the influence of early teaching moments. The video also points out that inner speech could be related to cognitive processes, memory, and mental health conditions such as depression, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]], and even psychotic disorders.

### Possible evolutionary origins of inner speech

#### The Hypothesis of Overt Speech Connection

> The evolution and origin of inner speech form another theme explored in the video. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that inner speech might have emerged as a side effect of the brain's mechanism for generating overt speech. It explains that when we speak, our brain sends signals to both motor and sensory areas, allowing us to predict what we are about to hear. This same mechanism occurs during inner speech, possibly serving as a form of error detection during spoken communication. However, the exact purpose and evolutionary origins of inner speech remain subject to ongoing research and debate.

> **Unanswered Questions and Future Research: Limitations and Potential Directions**
> The video also touches on the limitations and future directions of research on inner speech. It acknowledges that while progress is being made, there are still many unanswered questions about inner speech, including why it differs between individuals and whether it can be intentionally changed. The video concludes by highlighting the importance of continued research to uncover the complexities of inner speech and its role in human cognition and communication.

#### Evolutionary purpose of the inner voice

Idle chatter otherwise known as the monkey mind occupies a significant portion of our waking hours. Its evolutionary purpose is to help us solve problems, provide verbal working memory, planning, self-control and shaping our understanding of our identities.^[  [What to do if your inner voice is cruel | Ethan Kross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5XdX_ryHoc)]

## The Monkey Mind is the endless mind chatter according to Eastern philosophy

> [!ai]+ AI

> Monkey mind is a term used in Eastern philosophy to describe a restless and unsettled state of mind. It refers to the constant chatter and fluctuation of thoughts and emotions that distract us from being present in the moment. This state of mind is often characterized by a lack of focus, difficulty in concentration, and an inability to quiet the mind. The goal in many spiritual practices is to tame the monkey mind through mindfulness and meditation techniques, allowing for greater clarity, peace, and inner stillness.

### The monkey mind did not evolve to cope with modern stressors

The monkey mind is the endless chatter that we have in our minds. It's very similar to the voice of shame or the critical voice.

It tends to be a build up of what we think we should do and prevents us from living in the mind. The modern world has outpaced our brains which have been comparatively slow to evolve.

Think of the constant technological revolutions which have occurred even in the last 3 centuries. Evolution takes times and unfortunately, our brains may have failed to keep pace. As a result, [[Invisible lions of stress|modern stressors are invisible lions]].

By engaging in [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]], we can free ourselves of the endless chatter within our minds to stay grounded within the moment.
