# Choosing a cycling saddle

#status/done

---

[[2023-08-29]] I went to the store a while back and measured my seat width. They recommended about 142mm for me apparently. My current seat on the Aquila is not wide enough supposedly.

I've been having perineum pain while [[My love for cycling|cycling]] longer distances due to soft tissue pressure so it may be a sign of poor [[Bike fitting resources|bike fit]].

I'm wondering if I need to get myself measured and get a new saddle. With that being said, my saddle did slide from its rails so I'm not sure if that caused me to be unsupported. It's important to note that the saddle pain might not be caused by the seat itself, but a combination of other factors, because bike fitting is very complicated.

[[2023-06-21]] I moved the saddle back a bit. I think that helped and pointed the nose slightly down. I think it was riding up previously.

## How to measure sit bones

In this video,  [How to Choose the Correct Saddle Width - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL2QG5p-6Lg), he talks about the tin foil method. But going to the shop may be another solution.
