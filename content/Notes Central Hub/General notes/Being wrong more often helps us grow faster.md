## Science supports evidence that humility leads to increased happiness

Those who are more humble are less likely to be affected by depression, anxiety, as well as benefiting from higher happiness and life satisfaction. Humility can act as a buffer against stressful life events and their impact.

> And while it might not feel easy or fun at first, [[Practice epistemic humility to recognize the limitations of your knowledge and understanding|epistemic humility]], like all humility, has clear happiness benefits. In one [2016 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2015.1127991) in _The_ _Journal of Positive Psychology_, researchers created a humility score by asking people about their openness to advice, their honesty about their own strengths and weaknesses, and whether they tended to be excited about a friend’s accomplishments.
