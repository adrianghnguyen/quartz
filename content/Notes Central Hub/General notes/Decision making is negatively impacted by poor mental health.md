# Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health

For those living with mental health conditions or facing mental health challenges such as [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] and [[Depression|depression]], decision-making can become more challenging.^[Bishop, S. J., & Gagne, C. (2018). Anxiety, depression, and decision making: a computational perspective. Annual review of neuroscience, 41, 371-388.]

Studies have shown that anxiety disrupts the **decision-making regions** of the prefrontal cortex. It is essential to reduce anxiety in order to improve oneâ€™s decision-making.

Individuals living with **depression** may not be able to make decisions effectively for themselves, as they have lower motivation to engage in activities that will positively contribute to their wellbeing; for example, they will have lower [[Humans are motivated to grow|life-satisfaction]] and willpower to go to school, do homework, or even get out of bed.

Reducing symptoms of depression can start in a variety of ways, for example with seeking professional mental health support at a hospital clinic or accessing professional online resources or turning to a trusted loved-one for support.
