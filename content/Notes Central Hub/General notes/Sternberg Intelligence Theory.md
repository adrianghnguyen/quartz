# Sternberg intelligence theory

## Sternberg intelligence theory

Sternberg’s defines intelligence as the following:

- Learn from experience ([[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]) while optimising learning and developing metacognitive skills such as better [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]]
- Ability to adapt to one's immediate environment regardless of [[Personality is shaped our environment|social or cultural context]]

Someone who is able to learn more quickly ([[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]) would have better feedback ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]) cycles.

In regards to the second point, being familiar with the [[OODA Loop|faster decisions process of OODA loops]] would allow you to always situate you in unfamiliar environments to find your bearings and find the optimal solution.

### Formal definition of sternberg intelligence theory

> According to Sternberg’s Triarchic Theory of Intelligence, intelligence results from information processing components being applied to experience for the purposes of adaptation to, shaping of, and selection of environments.
>
> According to this theory, intelligence and the intellectual skills that constitute it and form the basis of intellectual achievements are forms of developing expertise-they can be developed just like any other forms of expertise. **Abilities are not fixed, but rather, flexible**.^[https://nrcgt.uconn.edu/newsletters/spring002/#:~:text=According%20to%20Sternberg's%20Triarchic%20Theory,of%2C%20and%20selection%20of%20environments.]

## The three pillars of intelligence according to sternberg

According to the **triarchic theory by Sternberng**, three kinds of thinking are essential to problem solving, in particular, and to human intelligence, in general.

- [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|analytical thinking]]
- [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creative thinking]]
- practical thinking

### Analytical thinking

**Analytical thinking** ([[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]]) occurs when the components are applied to relatively familiar types of problems in their abstracted form. [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|Analytical thinking]] is involved when people **analyze, evaluate, judge, compare and contrast, and critique**.

> For example, a student might be asked to evaluate the assumptions underlying a logical argument or to compare and contrast the themes underlying two short stories.

### Creative thinking

**Creative thinking ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]])** occurs when the components of information processing are applied to relatively novel types of problems. Creative thinking is involved when people create, invent, discover, explore, suppose, and imagine.

> For example, a student might be asked to create a poem or to invent a better mouse trap.

### Practical thinking

Practical thinking occurs when the components of [[Information processing theory|information processing]] are applied to highly contextualized, everyday problems.

Practical thinking is involved when people apply, use, utilize, implement, and contextualize.

> *For example, a student might be asked how the lessons of the Vietnam War are and are not relevant to the situation that has arisen in Serbia, or how to apply algebraic techniques to determining compound interest on an investment.*
