# Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger

#status/done

When we experience [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|stress]], we possess four primary types of bodily responses as part of the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response system]] cycle: fight, flight, freeze and fawn.

These help prepare the body to react to the potential threats/challenges/danger.

## Freeze aka Brake Stress Response Aka STOP

This type of stress originates in the [[Parasympathetic Nervous System|parasympathetic nervous system]] and is activated when we are in **extreme distress**.  If our brains believe that we can't survive through fight or flight, unable to **conquer** the threat of the stressor, - it tells us that our bodies need to shut down (aka freeze up or move slowly). This experience is called *tonic immobility*.

> Animals in the wild freeze and fall to the ground as a last-ditch effort to convince a predator theyâ€™re already dead; Stephen Porges has hypothesized that freeze is a stress response that facilitates a painless death.^[Porges, S. W. (2009). Reciprocal influences between body and brain in the perception and expression of affect. The healing power of emotion: Affective neuroscience, development & clinical practice, 27-54.]

## Accelerator Stress Response Aka GO

This [[Types of stress|type of stress]] originates in the [[Sympathetic Nervous System|sympathetic nervous system]] and engages fight and flight behaviors.

Our brains can decide that this is a threat with which we can engage and *conquer*. We may respond using anger. This is also engaged when we wish to protect our loved ones and is related to our [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment style]].

- **Fight** behaviour occurs when our [[Mesolimbic pathway is the emotional center of the brain|mesolimbic pathway aka emotional One Ring]]  determines that a [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|stressor]] should be *conquered*
- **Flight** behaviour when a [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|stressor]] should be *escaped*

We [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|can complete the stress the cycle]] by engaging in behavior (fight-flight) that eliminates the [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|stressor]] and the stress.

## Fawning responses AKA tend and befriend

One of the lesser known stress responses is tend and befriend (aka fawning to restore connection) which we can think of as the marriage of stress and attachment. women are more likely to use this affiliated stress response when dealing with potential threats.

Women are often considered the managers of relationships, where they may downplay their own [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] in order to create emotional space for the man (or "His Feels"). This is a form of emotional labour and is linked to [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|internal shame of emotions]].

## Misconception of the Stress Response cycle

It's often incompletely taught as the fight or flight response.

When we experience stress, our bodies release many chemicals aka [[Hormones involved in stress|many hormones involved in stress]] as well as activating bodily functions in order to prepare us for threats. In this mode, our bodies are looking for the next path of action dependent on the thread, it's context dependent.
