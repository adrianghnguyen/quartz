# Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge of what is known

> [!NOTE] From science fiction author to terminology
> The adjacent possible is a term taken from the science writer Steven Johnson, who took it from Stuart Kauffman, that helps explain the origin of *innovation*.

> Johnson notes that the **next big ideas** in any field are typically found right beyond the **[[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|current cutting-edge]]**, in the adjacent space that contains the possible new combinations of existing ideas. The key observation is that *you have to get to the cutting edge of a field* before its adjacent possible—and the innovations it contains—becomes visible.
