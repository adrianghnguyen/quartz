## Overview of neuroticism

> [!warning] Do not confuse with **neurosis**

> Neuroticism is the trait disposition to experience [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|negative affects]], including anger, anxiety, self‐consciousness, irritability, emotional instability, and depression^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5428182/#wps20411-bib-0001]. Such people are thought to respond worse to [stressors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressor "Stressor") and are more likely to interpret ordinary situations, such as minor frustrations, as appearing hopelessly difficult.

> [!NOTE] Poor validity in psychological diagnostics
> After speaking with [[Dominique Clement]], my therapist, she mentioned that that the Big 5 Ocean metrics are not valid from a **DSM or diagnostic standpoint**. However, it may be helpful as a [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]]
> 
One way to explain neuroticism is the tendency for quick arousal and slow relaxation from said arousal, especially in regards to [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|negative affect]] and may experience more [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|feelings of threat]]. Slow relaxation from negative arousals might be linked to [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]].

I've had a couple of assessments talk about my neuroticism.

### How we define neuroticism

This is studied within personality theory but there is still a lot of ongoing debate onto its exact definition.

#### Negativity bias towards arousal


#### Emotional instability or maladjustment

Defines neuroticism as emotional instability and negativity. In others words, being maladjusted.

Those low in neuroticism possess higher emotional stability ([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]) and are less reactive to [[_MOC Stress]]. "They tend to be calm, even-tempered, and less likely to feel tense or rattled. Although they are low in negative emotion, they are not necessarily high in positive emotion."^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism]

Those high in positive emotions tend to have traits related to extroversion. *Neurotic extroverts* go through emotional rollercoasters with high-highs and low-lows.^[Passer, Michael W.; Smith, Ronald E. (2009). Psychology: the science of mind and behaviour. McGraw-Hill Higher Education. ISBN 978-0-07-711836-5.]^[Passer, Michael W.; Smith, Ronald E. (2009). Psychology: the science of mind and behaviour. McGraw-Hill Higher Education. ISBN 978-0-07-711836-5.]

> [!NOTE] Personal comment
> I'm not sure how I feel about this definition. Perhaps it feels a bit reductive and it seems to say that that people high in neuroticism (aka me) are a bit crazy?

## Neuroticism is correlated with mental health disorders

People with high neuroticism tend to have strong correlations with mental disorders like anxiety and/or depression. Cause and effect between both is still unclear.^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism]

"The five big studies have described children and adolescents with high neuroticism as "anxious, vulnerable, tense, easily frightened, 'falling apart' under stress, guilt-prone, moody, low in frustration tolerance, and insecure in relationships with others", which includes both traits concerning the prevalence of negative emotions as well as the response to these negative emotions."^[Caspi, A.; Shiner, R. (2011). [[Temperament are enduring response characteristics|Temperament]] and Personality, in Rutter's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (5th ed). Malden: Blackwell Publishing Limited. p. 182. doi:10.1002/9781444300895. ISBN 9781444300895.]

## Possible theories for causes of neuroticism

See also [[Mental Noise Hypothesis]]

## Neuroticism is correlated with the startle reflex

> [!quote] Response to loud noises as a result of heightened vigilance
> Neuroticism is highly correlated with the [startle reflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startle_response "Startle response") in response to fearful conditions and inversely correlated with it in response to disgusting or repulsive stimuli. This suggests that Neuroticism may increase vigilance where evasive action is possible but promote emotional blunting when escape is not an option.^["The role of neuroticism in startle reactions to fearful and disgusting stimuli" (PDF).] A measure of the startle reflex can be used to predict the trait neuroticism with good accuracy; a fact that is thought by some to underlie the neurological basis of the trait. The startle reflex is a reflex in response to a loud noise that one typically has no control over, though anticipation can reduce the effect. The strength of the reflex as well as the time until the reflex ceases can be used to predict both neuroticism and extroversion.^[Corr, Philip J.; Wilson, Glenn D.; Fotiadou, Maria; Kumari, Veena; Gray, Nicola S.; Checkley, Stuart; Gray, Jeffrey A. (1995-10-01). "Personality and affective modulation of the startle reflex". Personality and Individual Differences. 19 (4): 543–553. doi:10.1016/0191-8869(95)00059-F. ISSN 0191-8869.]
