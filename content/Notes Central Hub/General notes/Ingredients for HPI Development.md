# Ingredients for HPI Development

#status/done

In a nutshell, for giftedness to bloom, one needs the right factors to come online:

- [[Personality is shaped our environment|Exogenous factors]]
	- Chance and opportunity
	- Good teachers
	- A [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|supportive community]]
- Endogenous factors
	- [[Theories of creativity and motivation|Creativity]]
	- Motivation
	- [[Natural and acquired competencies|Above average competencies]]

See also [[Stages of talent development]].

## Environmental factors for HPI development

### The role of chance and opportunities in the development of HPI

One needs chance and **[[View challenges as opportunities|opportunities for development]]**  to develop talent by allowing aptitude, motivation and creativity to bloom more opportunities for reactions.

#### HPI chance analogy to chemistry

- If we had to put it in words used in chemistry: increase the *collisional frequency*
	- ${HPI = chance * opportunity}$

> [!NOTE] Definition: Collisional frequency
> Collisional Frequency is **the average rate in which two reactants collide for a given system** and is used to express the average number of collisions per unit of time in a defined system. It's a term mainly used in chemistry and I can read up more on *collision theory* one day..^[https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Kinetics/06%3A_Modeling_Reaction_Kinetics/6.01%3A_Collision_Theory/6.1.04%3A_Collision_Frequency#:~:text=Collisional%20Frequency%20is%20the%20average,time%20in%20a%20defined%20system.]

### A support network for the child's giftedness development

- **[[How to best raise a potentially gifted child|Familial support]]** such as a parent bringing their child to activities, financial support, etc.
- **Educational/pedagogical support** such as adapted educational plans or increased extracurricular time
- **Psychological support** to help the child achieve their ambitious objectives

#### How to provide psychological support in HPI development

> [!question] What can [[Tran Huynh]] and [[Tim Trinh|Papa]] do to help support my growth?

To allow the gifted child to convert this resource into [[Talent is dedication by few|rare talent]], the [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|support network]] will need to guide the child through the process with the purpose of helping them overcome the long road of difficulties, and self-appointed lofty objectives.^[p.90 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

- Help maintain the **high levels of motivation, determination and tenacity** towards objectives
- Achieve incremental increase in level of responsibility to **become involved in the development process** of the gifted child's performance, strengths and weaknesses
- Maintain the **[[High performance requires these personal values|spirit of creativity, innovation and productivity]]**
- Help balance a **healthy** level of [[Perfectionism]], [[Social comparison|social comparison]] which is positive and optimal for performance
- Initiate and maintain **key relationships** with people of *high value*
	- Avoid [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|toxic people]]
	- [[Choose social circles wisely|Pick your circles wisely]]
- Be open to alternative forms of education as appropriate and **trust the child in their own [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|confidence]] to self-direct their education**
- Have [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|confidence]] in their [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]]
- Move forward with opportunities - **[[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|Dare greatly]]**

[[The need to belong is the root of social connection|No one lives alone and it requires a village to build something grand.]]

## Intrinsic primary factors for HPI development

In addition to **chance** and **biological** [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|factors]], there are the following primary characteristics/factors:

- [[Natural and acquired competencies|Above average aptitude]] (*not necessarily superior*) in certain **competencies** like physical/intellectual competencies
- High level of **[[Success requires time and patience|motivation]]**  and **engagement** in [[Curiosity as my worldview|trying out new things]]
- High level of **[[Theories of creativity and motivation|creativity]]**

As a result, it's better to think of [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|HPI as a set of gifted behaviours]]. HPI can be considered malleable and can vary [[Incremental change|over time]] and [[Personality is shaped our environment|subject to environment context]] - as opposed to something which is [[Fixed mindset|fixed]].

## Is deliberate practice an appropriate substitute for HPI?

**No.**

Long empirical support says that [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]] is not a substitute for [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]] factors - contrary to the popularity of [[The 10 000-hour rule|10 000 hour rule]]. At a certain level of expertise, only 74% of the performance difference can be attributed to the factor of deliberate practice.^[Ackerman, P. L. (2018). Expertise: Individual differences, human abilities, and nonability traits. In S. I. Pfeiffer, E. Shaunessy-Dedrick, & M. Foley-Nicpon (Eds.), APA handbook of giftedness and talent (pp. 259–272). American Psychological Association. https://doi.org/10.1037/0000038-017]

When *held for the same level of training time*, researchers said *these factors explain the performance [[Within-group and Between Group Differences|difference between individuals]]*:

- Natural level of [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]] or competency
- Psychosocial support to develop [[Stages of talent development|giftedness into talent]]
