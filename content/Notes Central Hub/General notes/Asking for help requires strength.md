It requires [[Mental strength|mental fortitude]] to admit that we [[Practice epistemic humility to recognize the limitations of your knowledge and understanding|don't know the all the answers]] and that we require the support from other people as it displays a tremendous amount of [[Emotional vulnerability is the willingness and ability to express true emotions|emotional vulnerability]]. No person is an island. I sometimes have the [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|dysfunctional belief]] that I am weak because I experience emotions so strongly - but this is coming from a place of [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|shame]] as it was implanted into my [[The garden of shame metaphor|personal garden]].

## My personal shame in asking for help

I feel like sometimes I'm afraid of asking for help when I am facing a crisis because it's admitting weakness, but perhaps I can learn to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe perspective]] that [[mental strength]] is about knowing when to ask for help and it takes humility, vulnerability, and [[Daring greatly is to embrace vulnerability and face life with courage|courage]] to engage in that. I should try to not buy into the cultural message that [[Mental strength|mentally strong]] people don't ask for help.

I sometimes think that if I am truly strong - I should be able to do it alone. But I guess that's not really true is it? It's important to remember that [[Mental strength|mental strength]] is unrelated to the status of my [[Mental illness|mental health state]].
