## Root cause analysis

> [!ai]+ AI
> is a process that is used to determine the cause of a problem. The analysis may be conducted by using any of several software programs or services that may be needed to determine the cause of the issue.

> The analysis may include, but is not limited to:
>
> -analyses of data sources such as computer systems or customer data
> -analyses of system event logs or application logs
> -analyses of customer behavior or specific customer Lavender 2d0a1cf' 's

> The analysis may also include the consideration of available suspects and suspect groups. It may also include the use of evidence analysis and any number of other methods to help determine the cause of the issue.

## Common techniques for root cause analysis

### Mapping cause and effect

Three similar cause and effect identification techniques:
- Fishbone diagram
- Root cause mapping
- Fault tree analysis
Determining cause and effect by identifying all possible sources and possible attributions. This can be used as a technique in brainstorming sessions and group discussions.

### Using the 5 Whys technique

Keep drilling into a point by further asking Why until you get to the fundamental root. It's similar to using [[Second order thinking|second order thinking]] but to the Nth level. We don't want the surface issues but rather the root

## Root cause analysis

See also [[Pareto principle]]

### What is the pareto principle?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This means that a small percentage of inputs or factors contribute to a large percentage of outputs or results. The principle was named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of its population. The Pareto principle is often applied in business and management to identify the most important factors that contribute to success or failure, and to prioritize actions accordingly.

## Failure mode and effect analysis (FEMA)

Look at every single step of a process and identify potential failures in each stage. You should implement safeguards and constraints to prevent similar issues from happening again in the future.


### Dig deep until you get to the root cause of emotions

Once you have [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|identified your feelings]], you need to go [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|several layers deeper]]. Whenever you have a thought such as *"I feel bad because I don't have a job right now"* [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|keep asking yourself why]]. Then once you develop an answer, ask yourself why to that answer. Repeat this again. And again. Until you get to the bottom root of your insecurity. This is using the second-order thinking techniques.^[https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/#:~:text=Second%2Dorder%20thinking%20is%20more%20deliberate.&text=Second%20order%20thinkers%20ask%20themselves,that%20to%20inform%20your%20decision.]
