This is interesting because I mainly knew about tactical urbanism - *courtesy of Reddit* - as well as traditional projects but did not know of the middle ground which existed. Montreal and a lot of other cities have been following suit so it's no surprise. I didn't know there was a specific term for this type of [[urban planning|urban planning]].
