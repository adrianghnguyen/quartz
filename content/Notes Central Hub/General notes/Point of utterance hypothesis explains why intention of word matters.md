What is the point of utterance hypothesis?
> [!ai]+ AI

> The point of utterance hypothesis is a linguistic theory that suggests that the meaning of a particular sentence or utterance is determined by the speaker's intended purpose or goal in making that statement. In other words, the meaning of a sentence is not solely based on the words themselves, but also on factors such as context, tone, and the speaker's intentions. The theory emphasizes that communication is a cooperative process where speakers and listeners work together to convey and interpret meaning.

## We communicate with a purpose that is greater than conveying information aka illocutionary force

It's a linguistic theory which serves to explain that when we talk, we tend to have a purpose (utterance with meaning). In other words, we talk because we want to say something. It's more than just sounds or simply conveying information (i.e. there's another layer to words) This concept is called illocutionary force.

The theory states that if we want to truly understand what is being said, utterance, then we also need to understanding the additional layer or meaning - illocutionary force.

One of these models to understand why we may repeat ourselves or change our wording is the [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|TOTE model]]. If we feel like we didn't make our point, we may take another approach or try to use different words, raise our tone, etc.

## Point of utterance hypothesis

> The Point of Utterance Hypothesis is a linguistic theory proposed by the linguist John Searle in 1969. According to this theory, every speech act (an utterance that conveys meaning) has a point or purpose, which is known as its illocutionary force. In other words, when people speak, they are doing more than just making sounds or conveying information; they are also trying to achieve a particular goal, such as making a request, giving an order, or asking a question.

> Searle argued that understanding the **illocutionary force of an utterance is essential to interpreting its meaning**, as it provides important context and clues about the speaker's intentions and expectations. For example, the sentence "Can you pass the salt?" might appear to be a simple request for salt, but it could also be interpreted as a polite way of expressing irritation with someone who has not yet passed the salt.

> The Point of Utterance Hypothesis has been influential in the study of pragmatics, which is the branch of [[Linguistics]] that deals with how language is used in context to convey meaning. By emphasizing the importance of illocutionary force in interpreting utterances, Searle's theory has helped researchers better understand how people use language to achieve their communicative goals in different social and cultural contexts.

### Explain the point of utterance hypothesis, like an idiot

> Imagine that a husband goes to the grocery store with a list of things to buy. At the same time, he is being followed by a detective who is observing which products he is acquiring and writing them on a list as well. In the end, **both the husband and the detective will have the same list (both contain the same items). Yet, they are different:**

> > “In the case of the shopper’s list, the purpose of the list is, so to speak, to get the world to match the words; the man is supposed to make his actions fit the list. In the case of the detective, the purpose of the list is to make the words match the world; the man is supposed to make the list fit the actions of the shopper.”
