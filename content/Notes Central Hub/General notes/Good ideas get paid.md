## How to sidestep the trap of control via the law of financial viability

> The law of financial viability states that when deciding whether to follow an appealing pursuit that will introduce more control into your work life, you should **ask yourself whether people are willing to pay for it**. If so, continue. If not, move on. ^dc98ec

Presented by the book [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]].

The author presents this in relation to [[_MOC Career|careers]] but in my opinion, this also applies to good fundamental business value propositions. I came up with this idea while discussing [Why Uber Fails to Disrupt Transportation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajHg97qx4r0 "Why Uber Fails to Disrupt Transportation").

## On the discussion of uber, disruption and the law of financial viability, as said to [[andre paul johnson]]

I presented the following hypothesis while talking with [[Andre Paul Johnson]]:

> [!quote] My hypothesis on why businesses require good fundamentals
> You can't subsidize your way out of bad fundamentals. Buying out the market isn't a sustainable strategy for most businesses. Amazon and eBay got lucky. and even Amazon is learning to pay the price today considering AWS is one of the strongest revenue drivers. This is a thought which I need to explore further but if you have a good idea and good product, it'll pay for itself. You can accelerate, it with external funding but good products would develop their own inertia.

Some evidence of Uber failing is them sunsetting their original value proposition of self-driving by cutting down on their self-driving division. They originally had a niche and comparative advantage through the introduction of their app ecosystem to disrupt taxi drivers. However, this ecosystem became saturated and they became outcompeted. We see this evidence with regulatory capture and Did introducing subsidy wars pushing Uber out of the Chinese market.

We also have Lyft who went in a separate direction and changing their north star from the shared economy of self-driving cars over to micromobility. We can see this as an example of [[Continuous learning spurs personal growth|continuous learning]] and proper [[Feedback loop|reinforcement cycles]] ([[Feedback loop]]).

The equivalent of continuous adaptation, a form of evolution, of people ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]) applied to business would be striving to keep building your business moat and developing momentum (or inertia) and push out your niche in a way your competitors cannot catch up. Evolution is an arms race ([[Evolution is an arms race]]) and if you can't keep up, you get left behind. Even if you were the market pioneer, resting on laurels means death. Stagnancy means death. If you can predict where the market is going, you can lead while your competitors are constantly chasing. We can learn from the dragonflies and their apex insect predator status ([[[[Learning from dragonflies]]]]) who use the prediction method of hunting.

### My personal thoughts

> [!NOTE] Homer Simpson on the economic exchange value of peanuts
> Homer : Aw, twenty dollars! I wanted a peanut.
> Homer's Brain : Twenty dollars can buy many peanuts!
> Homer: Explain how!
> Homer's Brain: Money can be exchanged for goods and services.

Remember what Homer Simpson taught us. People will give us money if we come up with good shit. Make good ideas -> Execute well -> People give you money -> Receive good dopamine
