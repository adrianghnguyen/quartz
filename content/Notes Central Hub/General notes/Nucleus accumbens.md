## Role of the nucleus accumbens

> [!NOTE] Shortened form of Nucleus Accumbens is NAc

The nucleus accumbens is a region of the brain located in the basal ganglia, which is part of the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]]. It plays an important role in the reward and pleasure circuits of the brain, as well as in the regulation of motivation and reinforcement learning.

It also regulates avoidance and approach behaviour ([[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust]]) in one's [[REF Emotional environments retune the valence of appetitive versus fearful functions in nucleus accumbens|environment]].

## Inputs to the nucleus accumbens

The nucleus accumbens receives input from several other regions of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. It is connected to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which is responsible for producing the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is a key component of the brain's reward system.

## Link between reward systems and the nucleus accumbens

When a person engages in activities that are rewarding, such as [[Practice mindfulness while consuming|eating food]], engaging in sexual activity, or using drugs, the nucleus accumbens is activated and dopamine is released. This creates a feeling of pleasure and reinforces the behavior, making the person more likely to engage in the activity again in the future.

As a result, the nucleus accumbens plays a role in the regulation of [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual arousal]].

Dysfunction in the nucleus accumbens has been implicated in **addiction and other psychiatric disorders.**
