## What is the firehose of falsehood?

> [!ai] AI
>
> The firehose of falsehood is a propaganda technique used to spread false information on a large scale. It involves the rapid and continuous dissemination of misleading or inaccurate information through various channels, including social media, news outlets, and political speeches. The term "firehose" refers to the sheer volume of information being disseminated, while "falsehood" refers to the inaccurate or deliberately misleading nature of the information. This technique is often used by authoritarian regimes or political actors seeking to manipulate public opinion and undermine democratic institutions.

The goal of this propaganda technique is to inundate someone with so much information it's hard for dump tell what is true and what isn't. As of today for example the Russian regime uses this technique as a way to wage disinformation campaigns against Western countries such as America.

## My personal relationship with the firehose of falsehood

I guess this is somewhat of a personal subject for me because I had a former friend who became a conspiracist. He %%Calvin Chan%% really fell down the rabbit hole and became a QAnon believer. It was one of the straws that broke the camels back because our ideologies were diverging. Facebook and other social media sources are often the ways that people consume information these days. And I don't blame people for believing things straight off the bat it has happened to me before and I've been wrong. It takes a lot of effort to engage into critical thinking rather than disagreeing what gives us an emotional reaction similar to doom scrolling. It's why it can be important for us to practice [[Digital minimalism]] and be very selective in types of sources that we read for our information.

For example, you'll have content creation farms not necessarily producing real information but rather lies. We can attribute this to the rise of technology causing a [[Data Explosion|data explosion]]. Social media also tires us out by causing us to have to constantly [[Mental cost of context switching|change our mental context]]. This can wear down our ability to think critically.
