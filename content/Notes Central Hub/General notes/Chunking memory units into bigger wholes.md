# Recoding information

Miller, an American Psychologist, stressed the importance of recoding—**the reorganization of information into fewer units with more bits of information per unit**—as a central feature of human thought processes. ^[https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-A-Miller#ref1200615]. In other words, we can chunk information in order to combine the components into a bigger whole - similar to gestalt principles ([[Gestalt Principles]]).

Recoding *increases the quantity of data that one can process effectively* and can help to overcome the [[Working memory is limited|seven-item information-processing limit]]. Modifying our [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]] ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) and leveraging [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handles]] ([[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas]]) can help us consolidate information into a single unit instead of leaving them as multiple unconnected thoughts.

For example, if I say the word competitive advantage, your brain has already started making many implications and assumptions rather than needing me to spell out all the various of components of the concept. This allows us to have a higher level conversation through an advanced start point - a mental shortcut ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]]) if you will.

Miller held that the most common kind of recoding is verbal—what one relies upon when trying to remember a story or an event, for example.

## Recoding example - reorganizing information

> Thus, the story in example 1 below may be verbally recoded as the story in example 2:
>
> 1. Franny went to the park with Zooey yesterday, and they played Frisbee, flew kites, and lain in the grass looking at birds. Then they went to a nearby diner and had grilled-cheese sandwiches with french fries.
>
> 2. A **girl and boy** *(Zooey and Franny)* went to the park (Frisbee, kites, birds) and ate (grilled cheese and fries at diner).
>
> In the recoded form the story is reduced to a basic framework, and the details (indicated in parentheses) are organized around the framework.
>
> **Girl and a boy** = framework
> *Zooey and Franny* = details^[https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-A-Miller]
