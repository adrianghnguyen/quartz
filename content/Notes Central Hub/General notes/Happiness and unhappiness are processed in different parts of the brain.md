# Happiness and unhappiness are processed in different parts of the brain

#status/done

Related to [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively]]

---

A common [[Happiness is born hand in hand misery|misconception is that lowering the sources of negative feelings will increase positive feelings]]. This is because we use different parts of the [[prefrontal cortex]] within the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]] to process happiness (left side) and unhappiness (right side).

Raising positive emotions and lowering negative ones involve independent neurological processes.

## Research papers on the subject

### Affect and the brain's functional organization: a resting-state connectivity approach

[Affect and the Brain's Functional Organization: A Resting-State Connectivity Approach | PLOS ONE](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0068015)

Within its abstract, it references the use of the  [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule measures personal affect|Positive and Negative Affect Schedule aka PANAS survey]]  to classify the emotional states which they are measuring.

> Our data here provides partial support for both hypotheses, as it suggests the right hemisphere being more dominant in negative affective processing while neither showing a general affective lateralization towards the right nor a left-hemispheric dominance in positive affect.

So it seems like emotions are processed by common areas within the brain, but also that negative effect as well as positive effect have hyper specific regions in which they live (this is called lateralization).

> Consistent with the idea that we understand emotional states by internally generated somatosensory representations, the somatosensory cortex has been associated with the recognition of emotional expression.

Would that mean that we experience emotional states by looking at how our bodies react? Would that be evidence that [[Emotions are interlinked with biology|emotions and biology are intertwined]]?

#### Article conclusion

> By investigating how whole-brain functional connectivity from 200 regions-of-interest covaried with PANAS scores for positive and negative affect, we tested four previously suggested hypotheses about how affective processing is organized in the brain.
>
> Our results provide some support for both theories about lateralization, as they show a right-sided dominance effect for negative affective processing, but while they do not currently suggest a general lateralization of affective processing to be present throughout the brain, they also suggest positive affective processing to be bilaterally dominant.
>
> Our data is mostly in line with the hypothesis of a largely overlapping joint network basic to processing of all emotions, as revealed by the conjunction analysis of overlapping regions.
>
> Additionally, as shown through different results in connectivity, there is also some support for the hypothesis that processing of certain emotions may recruit distinct regions.
>
> However, because of *the substantial overlap, it seems unlikely that these should be independent*. In essence, our findings suggest a network-based or constructionist framework between localized elements responsible for affective processing, which is more dominant in the right than in the left hemisphere for negative affect.

There seems to be evidence of lateralization in the processing of negative and positive affect. However, there is a substantial overlap in brain areas in the overall processing of these emotions.

## Nurturing the different sources of positive and negative emotions

We should remember that [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|happiness is an investment portfolio]]. Do we have an excess of negative feelings? Or are we lacking in positive feelings?

Unhappiness can stem from things like mental illnesses or barriers, which keep us from pursuing happiness. It can be often hard to distinguish this one.
