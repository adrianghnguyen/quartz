# Three ring conception of giftedness by renzulli

#status/done

## Eli5 of renzulli's theory of giftedness

Related to [[Theories of creativity and motivation]]

It's one of the primary conceptual models explaining how giftedness ([[High intellectual potential overview]]) is a three prong approach:

- Above average competencies ([[Natural and acquired competencies]])
- Creativity ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]])
- Task commitment aka how determined the gifted child is towards accomplishing their goals ([[Talent is dedication by few]])

## Formal definition of renzulli's three ring definition of giftedness

> [!NOTE] Additional resource
> [Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness | Renzulli Center for Creativity, Gifted Education, and Talent Development](https://gifted.uconn.edu/schoolwide-enrichment-model/three-ring_conception_of_giftedness/)

> Developed by Joseph Renzulli, the Three Ring Conception of Giftedness is a developmental approach that has revolutionized gifted and talented identification.
>
> The Three Rings include: Above Average Ability, Creativity and Task Commitment. Students who possess the combination of these three traits exhibit gifted behavior. To achieve their [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|full potential]], these students require challenges above and beyond those offered in the regular classroom.^[https://renzullilearning.com/en/Menus/7-researchbased-learning-system#:~:text=Developed%20by%20Joseph%20Renzulli%2C%20the,Ability%2C%20Creativity%20and%20Task%20Commitment.]

## Main profiles for giftedness

- Schoolhouse/Academic giftedness
	- Intellectual abilities to do well in school
- Creative-Productive giftedness
	- Main qualities
		- Need to change things (concept of novelty and innovation) - sounds similar to [[Curiosity as my worldview]]
		- Ability to have impact on others (concept of relevance)
	- Those in this category tend to differ from the academically gifted in terms of their behaviors and [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]]

## Six main cognitive traits of giftedness according to benzulli

Trait | Explanation
--|--
Optimism | hope, and positive outlook towards difficult tasks (see also [[Grit by Angela Duckworth]])
Courage | Independent and strong sense of morals ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]])
Passion  | Enthusiasm and ability to deeply focus on a task ([[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence]])
Physical and mental energy | Charisma and curiosity ([[Curiosity as my worldview]])
Sense of destiny | Belief in self-efficacy and self-determinism ([[Humans are motivated to grow]])

See also [[Developmental and Cognitive Characteristics of Highly Gifted Children]].

[[Self-perception refers to the way individuals perceive and interpret themselves]]

## Relationship between engagement as flow and task challenge relevance

This is closely related to the mechanisms of curiosity driving flow states ([[Flow Triggers]]).

Renzoulli states that giftedness is "a huge form of intense motivation directed towards a task or specific domain of interest" which brings a gifted person to display endurance, tenacity and [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|exceptional determination]] towards certain goals despite the circumstances.^[p.54-55 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

Experts believe that this [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] is the initial factor in developing gifted behaviors, which is dependent on personal and [[Personality is shaped our environment|environmental factors]] and plays a central role in one's success. this is closely linked to modern research thinking concerning [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow states]].

### Anxiety and boredom as a flow brakes

There are two main brakes to this process:

- [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] which may occur when the *perceived challenge is too great*
- [[The philosophical source of boredom|Boredom]] which may occur when one's capabilities are too high for the task.

Is it possible because we're not being intellectually stimulated - or are there possibly other causes ([[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism]])? As a result, finding the right balance of challenge is important.
