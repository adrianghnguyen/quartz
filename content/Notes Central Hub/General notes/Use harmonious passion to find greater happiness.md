> Passion is a consistency of interests with the tendency to invest effort in the same goal over time.^[Eskreis-Winkler, L., Gross, J. J., & Duckworth, A. L. (2016).

It is characterized by a deep enjoyment and fulfillment derived from engaging in the activity. People with harmonious passion feel a sense of autonomy and control over their pursuits, and they engage in them willingly and wholeheartedly. This type of passion is associated with higher levels of well-being, satisfaction, and perseverance in the face of challenges.

Harmonious passion is different to obsessive passion. It's what we feel when our work is integrated into a balanced and healthy life. When we put into the context of our work we enjoy it, but we also like our rest from it.

With harmonious passion, [[Harvard course on managing happiness|according to Arthur Brooks]], we learn to not dread Mondays, but we also enjoy weekend with our family and friends. We learn to not define ourselves by our [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career]]. We can learn to think about other things in our off hours. Our job is no longer our entire personality.
