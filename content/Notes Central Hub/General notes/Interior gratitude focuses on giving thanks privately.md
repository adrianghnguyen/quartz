# Interior gratitude focuses on giving thanks privately

Related to [[The difference between interior and external gratitude]]

According to [[REF Choose to Be Grateful. It Will Make You Happier.|Choose to Be Grateful. It Will Make You Happier.]], practicing interior gratitude is learning to say *thanks privately*. Interior gratitude is an internal experience that can bring happiness, contentment, and a sense of fulfillment.

It is a personal emotion that arises from recognizing and appreciating the positive aspects of one's life, such as good health, supportive relationships, or personal achievements. It's an internal state of mind which affects our relationship with ourselves.

We primarily practice interior gratitude when we learn to be grateful for our selves, [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|to love yourself with your whole heart]] and recognize that [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|you are enough]]. It's also being thankful to [[Non-zero day mindset|3 you's]] and [[Understanding the complexity of life|your voyage in life]].
