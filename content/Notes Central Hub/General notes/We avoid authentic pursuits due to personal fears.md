## We avoid pursuing goals due to various fears

> [!Question]
> Would this be the same fear as of the [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|Freeze Fight or Flight Response to deal to danger]]? From my understanding, we tend to experience such negative feelings, that being this self-hatred and paralysis when we experience [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|perceived threats or challenges]].

Based on the advice from the [[The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron|The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron]], we should reframe the feeling of no movement for what it is - fear - perhaps fear of failure, fear of success, fear of abandonment. Perhaps we are afraid of embracing an identity which may be rejected by others, or other [[You are not your inner critic|external voices which live within our minds]] planted at an [[Early childhood experiences exert lifelong outcomes|early times within our lives]].

In other words, we may be avoiding the pursuit of a course of action because of deep-rooted [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]] which may have been instilled within our [[You are not your inner critic|inner critic]]. Perhaps there is deep seated [[Shame and guilt are inherited|inherited shame and guilt]] which stops us from embracing [[Vision as deep personal expression|authentic]] actions.

## Identify your source of fear preventing a career switch

Perhaps we are unhappy and think we need to make a career change because we don't think we are [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|living authentically]] and our current work does not bring us a sense of fulfillment. This prevents us from [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]].

We need to unpack these subconscious voices and find what we wish to keep. Dealing with the fear of failure can come from any of the yearning octopus, so keep digging. It's important to find the specific source of said fear to unpack this.

A lot of these fears are related to one's [[Self-perception refers to the way individuals perceive and interpret themselves|self-perception]], [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]], and the how others may perceive us, that we will be judged for our choices in making a career change. It can lead to some questions of self doubt and various other [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]].

- fear of failure: Will I be able to achieve it? What if I am not smart enough?
- fear of external perception: Will others judge us negatively for our choice? Will we feel embarrassed presenting our choice?
- fear of self-image: will others judge me for not looking successful or not looking smart?
- fear of changed lifestyle: am I willing to make changes in my living style to pursue my path?
- fear of financial security: are there financial commitments/ends to meet which are preventing me from making a career switch?
- resistance to change, whether in terms of self-identity or in terms of external lifestyle/image

### Avoiding an authentic career path

Based on the advice from [[REF How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why|How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why]], if we're not working towards a career we actually yearn for, it's important to figure out why not. This may require [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|deep introspection]] to understand the root causes of the fear. Fear of failure is too unspecific and masks underlying yearnings which manifest themselves as a type of fear.
