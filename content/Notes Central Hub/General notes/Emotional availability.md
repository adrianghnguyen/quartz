## Emotional availability is the ability to connect and engage with others

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Emotional availability refers to a person's ability to emotionally connect and engage with others in a healthy and meaningful way. It involves being open, responsive, and sensitive to the emotional needs of oneself and others. An emotionally available person is capable of expressing and understanding their own emotions as well as being present for and supportive of the emotions expressed by others. They are able to provide comfort, empathy, and understanding in relationships, fostering a sense of safety and trust. Emotional availability is crucial for building deep connections, maintaining intimate relationships, and overall emotional well-being.

What are the reasons why someone would not be emotionally available? Perhaps they are [[Fatigue|exhausted or tired]], have their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|own personal concerns which have not been shared]], etc. They might also [[Fear of rejection|fear being rejected]].

We may choose to withdraw emotionally and close the opportunity for [[Emotional vulnerability is the willingness and ability to express true emotions|emotional vulnerability]].

## Emotional withdrawal

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Emotional withdrawal refers to a pattern of behavior where an individual intentionally distances themselves emotionally from others. It often involves avoiding or minimizing emotional connections, expressing limited emotions, and keeping personal feelings and thoughts hidden. Emotional withdrawal can occur in various relationships, such as romantic partnerships, friendships, or family dynamics. It is often a defense mechanism used to protect oneself from potential emotional pain or vulnerability. However, excessive emotional withdrawal can lead to feelings of isolation and hinder healthy communication and connection with others.

## Is it possible to have an emotional bond with someone who is not emotionally present nor vulnerable?

From conversations with [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI]].

> That makes a lot of sense. It's really difficult to have an emotional bond with someone who has trouble being emotionally present or vulnerable. It sounds like you're quite self-aware and you've done a lot of reflection about how this dynamic works between the two of you. Can I ask, what are you hoping to achieve by opening up to her about these things? Is it about wanting her to change, or more about a need for closure or acceptance?
>
> It's both I think. I'm not sure what to do. She progresses slowly, but it feels like I need to do most of the emotional labour.
>
> That's a really hard dynamic to navigate. It can feel like you're always the one doing the emotional heavy lifting, while she doesn't reciprocate or meet you halfway. It sounds exhausting. It's not your job to change her, and you can't force her to put in the emotional work. You can only control your own actions and responses. Are you worried that if you stop putting in all the emotional effort, the relationship will dissolve? Or do you think there's a way to have a relationship with her without having to carry all the emotional weight?

> I don't know if I can handle the relationship only staying the way it is. It feels insufficient.
>
> It's completely valid for you to feel that way. You want to feel seen, heard and valued in a relationship, especially by a parent. And it's totally valid to feel like what you have right now isn't enough. The question then becomes: Do you need to step back from the relationship to take care of yourself, or is there a way to establish boundaries so that you're not over-extending yourself while still having a relationship? Can you put some limits on how much you'll emotionally give, while still feeling like it's worthwhile to be in contact with her?
