# Writing is the process by which we can learn effectively

See also [[Writing is the medium by which we think]]

> [!info] Writing to learn - Two possible definitions
> - **Writing-to-learn** refers to a family of [instructional design models](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Instructional_design_model "Instructional design model") that postulate positive effects of [pedagogical scenarios](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Pedagogical_scenario "Pedagogical scenario") that engage learners in writing activities.
> - **Writing-to-learn** is also known as the **writing across the curriculum movement (WAC)** movement, in particular in science teaching. According to Keys, WAC was inspired by Britton's (1970) work.

I came across this teaching paradigm while researching why [[Why I write in Obsidian|writing in Obsidian]] felt like it was helping learn so quickly. Although this is a new teaching paradigm, it stipulates that that the use of interactive computer technology (ICT) aka social expressive digital media (aka…writing tools like Obsidian?) help learners [[Transform information into knowledge|convert knowledge into understanding]] while sharing this with others.

This paradigm also explains how there is a relationship between personality types and the associated writing/learning behaviours ([[Relationship between MBTI and Writing]]).

## Overview of writing to learn

### Four main hypothesis of writing to learn

> 1. The **"[[Point of utterance hypothesis explains why intention of word matters|point of utterance]]"** hypothesis: writers spontaneously generate knowledge when they write (Galbraith, 1999).
> 2. The **"forward hypothesis"**: writers externalize ideas in text, and then reread them to generate new inferences.
> 3. The **"[[Genre hypothesis by Newell|genre hypothesis]]"**: writers use genre structures to organize relationships among elements of text, and thereby among elements of knowledge (Newell, 1984).
> 4. The **"backward hypothesis"**: writers set rhetorical goals, and then solve content problems to achieve these goals (Flower & Hayes, 1994).^[<https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Writing-to-learn> / (Klein, 1999)]

Essentially, Klein presents that writing helps us create new knowledge, concretize ideas from a nebulous form akin to the benefits of [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] ([[Journaling is healthy]]), use [[Brains organize information into schemas|existing schemas]] ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) as guidelines to organize knowledge into useful units, and work backwards by presenting possible hypothesis and finding information which proves or disproves it.

The last step of working backwards through hypothesis reminds me a lot about first principles ([[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]]) and the Feynman technique ([[Learn anything like Feynman]]) which focus on establishing basic foundational knowledge from which we build deeper and broad understanding of a subject. This theory of knowledge acquisition also posits that writing engages multiple mechanisms of learning. ([[Process information deeply to create knowledge]]).

Prior research on this teaching paradigm was focused on producing large texts which are self-contained. The modern approach with computer-supported collaborative work learning (CSCL) tools focuses on producing knowledge units about different types of genres (questions, arguments, definitions, etc.) In other words, we should ask create hypothesis, research information and learn to structure our information.

Wiki-style tools also known as "knowledge-building communities" are the perfect example of this method through constant living works of writing. This style of collaborative and evolving writing triggers meta-cognitive mechanisms for learning such as conceptual change ([[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time]]) and deeper understanding. ^[https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Writing-to-learn]

## Genre debate of writing-to-learn

### Original model of writing to learn by bereiter and scardamalia (1987)

These are presented by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987). They are the difference in instructional design models aka how to approach writing as a way to learn.

They posit that the purpose of writing text -they call this the *rhetorical goal of text*- is to discover new knowledge and ideas so they make distinctions on the two mechanisms on how this can occur based on the author's level of competencies.

#### Knowledge telling

> Ideas that respond to the rhetorical goal are retrieved from [[long-term memory]] and transferred directly into written text. This process of writing is used by those knowledgeable in the topic being considered.

[[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]

#### Knowledge-transformation

> Ideas retrieved from memory are transformed by the effort to resolve a conflict between the ideas and the rhetorical goal resulting in the generation of new ideas, content and a deeper understanding of the subject. This is the process of writers that lack expertise in the topic of the text being produced.

When we are still looking to understand a new topic ([[Learn anything like Feynman]]), we use this method. We fit information into our existing mental models ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]).

### Knowledge constitution (galbraith, 1998)

It's a refinement of the prior theory presented by Bereiter and Scardamalia.

Writing causes us to involve a network of ideas ([[Semantic network]]) which we deem as satisfactory (don't dig deeper) or unsatisfactory (dig deeper/examine further ideas). This is done in cyclical fashion where we develop new ideas or contradictory ideas. This back and forth process helps us understand a subject more deeply.

The more expertise we have, ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]) the greater our semantic network and ability to express ideas when we engage in the process of knowledge constitution. Essentially, the more we understand a subject, the more relationships we can draw upon and the better we are at expressing the concept. Think of the step within the Feynman technique where one should be able to teach to a 5 year told ([[Learn anything like Feynman]]).
