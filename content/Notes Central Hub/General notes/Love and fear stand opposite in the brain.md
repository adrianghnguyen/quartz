# Love is the opposite of fear

#status/wip

Related to [[Module 3 Love and Relationships, Part 1]]

[[Love can take many forms and definitions|Love]] can be expressed in multiple ways.

Oftentimes we hear that the opposite to love is hate or indifference. However, philosophically and psychologically, the opposite of [[Neurochemistry of love|love]] is actually [[Fear|fear]]. They downregulate one another - thus experiencing love makes us less fearful while [[fear]] prevents us from experiencing love.

As a result, if we wish to develop a [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|secure attachment style]], we need to overcome our past traumas.

## Neuroanatomy of love and fear

Emotions originate in the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system aka lizard brain]] which are further processed within the [[Prefrontal Cortex|prefrontal cortex]] where they become conscious. While both fear and [[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|love]] originate in the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]], they are *processed in different hemispheres* of the [[prefrontal cortex]].

Love is processed in the left hemisphere, while [[Fear|fear]] is processed in the right hemisphere of the brain. Research has discovered that both fear and love inhibit aka downregulate the other, meaning that the presence of one crowd out the other (source?). As a result, our ability to [[Sustaining long term romantic desire in monogamous relationships|love]] is related to our ability to not be fearful, and is at the very center of our happiness.

### Digging further into this

When we are [[Fear|afraid]] we engage in [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|avoidance behaviours]].

I can't seem to find the exact research on it but fear would drive [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]]. When are are anxious - we are unable to feel love? Since fear is closely related to anxiety, it would seem to me that it is related to heightened amygdala response. Is it harder to feel love when we are stressed?

The chain of logic would go anxiety -> fear -> heightened amygdala response -> inability to love?

> [!question] Oxytocin modulates amygdala fear responses?
> Many studies in preclinical animal models have described fear-reducing effects of the [neuropeptide](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neuropeptide "Learn more about neuropeptide from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") oxytocin in the central nucleus of the [amygdala](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/amygdala "Learn more about amygdala from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). However, recent studies have refined the role of oxytocin in the central [amygdala](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/amygdala "Learn more about amygdala from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), which may extend to the selection of an active defensive coping style in the face of immediate threat, and also fear-enhancing effects have been reported.

> On top of this, oxytocin enables the discrimination of unfamiliar conspecifics on the basis of their emotional state, which could allow for the selection of an appropriate coping style. This is in line with many observations that support the hypothesis that the precise outcome of oxytocin signaling in the central amygdala or other [brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/brain "Learn more about brain from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") regions depends on the emotional or physiological state of an animal. In this review, we highlight a number of studies to exemplify the diverse effects oxytocin exerts on fear in the central amygdala of rodents. These are discussed in the context of the organization of the [neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural-network "Learn more about neural network from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") within the central amygdala and in relation to the oxytocin-synthesizing neurons in the hypothalamus.
