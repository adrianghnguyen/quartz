[[Moral Foundations Theory|Moral Foundations Theory]] has been critiqued for not taking into account the concept of evolved cooperation

> First, MFT’s list of foundations has critical omissions. Despite claiming to be an evolutionary-cooperative account of morality, MFT fails to include the four most well-established types of evolved cooperation: kin altruism, reciprocal altruism, competitive altruism, and respect for prior possession.
>
> Kin altruism has no dedicated foundation in MFT. Although MFT argues that Care originally motivated investment in offspring, it is now applied to nonkin; and MFT treats “family” as just another type of “group.” The questionnaire (MFQ) does have two items pertaining to family, but they appear under Fairness and Loyalty, not Care.
> Reciprocal altruism has no dedicated foundation in MFT. Instead, MFT conflates reciprocity—a solution to iterated prisoners’ dilemmas—with fairness—a solution to bargaining problems. And the MFQ has no items pertaining to reciprocity.
> Competitive altruism—that is, costly signals of status, such as bravery or generosity—has no dedicated foundation in MFT, and no items in the MFQ.
> Respect for prior possession—that is, property rights and the prohibition of theft—has no dedicated foundation in MFT. The MFQ’s only mention of property occurs in an item about inheritance, under Fairness.
> Second, in addition to these omissions, MFT includes two foundations that are not distinct types of evolved cooperation: Care and Purity.
>
> Care—like “altruism” or “benevolence”—is a generic category, not a specific type of cooperation. It doesn’t distinguish between the various distinct types of cooperation—kin altruism, mutualism, reciprocal altruism, competitive altruism and their corresponding psychological mechanisms—all of which involve caring for different people (including family, friends, strangers) for different reasons.
> Purity is supposed to stem from the need to avoid “people w/ diseases, parasites & waste products.” But “avoiding pathogens” is not itself a cooperative problem, any more than, say, “avoiding predators.” And, indeed, MFT offers no connection between purity and cooperation. On the contrary, Purity is described as an “odd corner” of morality because it is not “concerned with how we treat other people.” Hence, categorizing Purity as a moral foundation is anomalous.^[https://behavioralscientist.org/whats-wrong-with-moral-foundations-theory-and-how-to-get-moral-psychology-right/]
