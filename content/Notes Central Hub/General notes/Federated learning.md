## What is federated learning?

Concept introduced by [[Stuart Alldritt]] on [[2023-03-12]]

> [!ai] AI
>
> Federated learning is a machine learning technique that allows multiple devices to collaboratively train a model without sharing their data with each other. This approach addresses privacy concerns and data security risks associated with traditional centralized machine learning systems.
>
> In federated learning, the model is initially trained on a central server using a small portion of data from each device. The server then sends the updated model to each device, which trains it further using its own local data. The local updates are then sent back to the server, which aggregates them to improve the global model.

> This [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative process]] continues until the desired level of accuracy is achieved. Federated learning has applications in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
