## Crisis of meaning is a feeling of psychological and existensial unrest

> **Crisis of meaning** refers to a state of psychological and existential unrest where individuals experience a deep sense of dissatisfaction, confusion, and disconnection from the meaning and purpose of their lives. It is characterized by a feeling of emptiness and a lack of direction, often accompanied by questions about the significance and value of one's existence.
>
> This existential crisis can arise from various sources, such as personal disappointments, loss of identity, or a mismatch between one's values and societal expectations. Individuals undergoing a crisis of meaning may engage in a process of self-reflection, searching for a renewed sense of purpose and a deeper understanding of their own values and priorities.
>
> They may seek personal growth, explore new beliefs or ideologies, or engage in practices that foster connection and meaning-making. Ultimately, the crisis of meaning can provide an opportunity for individuals to reevaluate their lives and make meaningful changes that align with their authentic selves and bring a sense of fulfillment.

Often spurred by times of [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transitions]] or big stressors, we can sometimes feel lost at times. It's a [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common feeling in people]]. But it's important to remember that [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feelings]] have an evolutionary purpose to indicate that something may not be correct - perhaps in my environment or in how I am approaching things.

Examples of questions which may arise:
- [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|Will I fail?]]
- Am I a [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|good enough person]]?
- What do I deserve in this world?
- What's my [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]]?

Based on [[Notes from How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why|Notes from How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why]], I think it's important to understand the fears and yearnings are two sides of the same coin and that leaving the answer at 'fear of failure' is not sufficient. I need to understand more of what's holding me back from [[Make the future you want with personal agency|taking charge]] of making a career change.

## Personal reflection on identity crisis

Part of me feels a deep sense of [[Imposter syndrome|imposter syndrome]] that maybe I don't deserve a [[My ideal life|good life worthy of my dreams]]. What do I dream about? What do I seek in life? That's a question upon which I also need to ponder. It's [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|quite distressing]] to be in this state of limbo where I feel chained down - unable to move forward with my feelings.

These days, I feel unsure of who I am and what I want to do next - rather I feel like I lack the [[Self-confidence|self-confidence]] to go ahead and tackle it.

It is easier to [[disassociation is tuning out as an adaptive response|tune out]] all my feelings and simply [[The behavioral shutdown model (BSM) is a conceptual model explain depression|shutting down]] to try and feel nothing at all. I would say that there are no dark thoughts yet at this moment but I feel unable to see life clearly. Things are murky with no clear path. I know that the solution is to [[Make quick and decisive actions|jump into action]] and is part of [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|being proactive when it comes to stress]] but I feel…heavy. Unable to move.

One step at a time. One day at a time. But why does this moment feel so painful? Is it the [[Fear of rejection|pain of rejection]] which drives a stake so deeply into this heart of mine? Perhaps I wish I could share this sorrow with someone else.

How many times must I suffer like this? [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|Life is not meant to be fair or cruel. It simply is.]] Is writing a form of procrastination or am I deciphering my feelings?

But long story short, there is a certain sickness of individualism and we should seek to find a sense of spirituality that we belong to the greater human existence, something espouse by the Dalai Lama when he talks about how [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others.]].
