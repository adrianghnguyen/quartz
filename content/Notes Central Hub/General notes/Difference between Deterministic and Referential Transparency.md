The main difference between [[deterministic]] and [[Referential transparency]] is that determinism is a property of a process or function, while referential transparency is a property of an expression or function. Determinism is concerned with the **behavior** of a process or function under **different inputs and conditions**, while referential transparency is concerned with the **substitutability** of expressions and functions in a program.
