# Revise information over at increasing time intervals using spaced repetition

Spaced repetition involves revising information at increasing intervals. This reflects and combats the fact that once you learn something you gradually forget it, with the forgetting happening fast at first, then leveling off. Using spaced repetition, you remind yourself of information often at first, then less often.

Practice recalling information repeatedly. It helps us [[Improving our memory|improve our memory and ability to recall information]].

Memory mastery comes from repeated exposure to new material. In order to learn something, you [need to retrieve it from memory](https://fs.blog/2015/11/to-learn-retrieve-make-it-stick/) again and again. Retrieval makes information stick even better than re-exposing yourself to the original material. It's best used when we are tackling new [[Sources of knowledge|sources of knowledge]].

Rote memorization doesn’t work. Period. The key to [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|accelerating learning]] is [spaced repetition](https://fs.blog/2018/12/spacing-effect/), a technique that works _with_ the way your brain naturally retains information, not against it. It's also a technique acknowledged in [[REF Knowledge work should accrete|Knowledge work should accrete by Andy Matuschak]].

Spaced repetition is a technique used in various learning strategies:
