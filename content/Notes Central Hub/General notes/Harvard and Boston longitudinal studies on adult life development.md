# Harvard and Boston longitudinal studies on adult life development

#status/done

Related to [[Happiness is the result of love]]

There was a longitudinal study conducted by Harvard in the 1938s which followed multiple cohort of students along with a similar one in the 1970s for Boston, also following their offsprings. It yielded a lot of information concerning psychology, happiness, well-being and long-term effects of health and relationships.

It's one of the longest studies of adult human life as we know it.

## Further context

> [!NOTE] Results of longitudinal studies on happiness
> The resulting studies yielded a treasure trove of information about how people either struggled to be happy, or thrived, over their lives. The researchers conducted annual, full-length interviews with each of the participants and their spouses. The extensive interviews were carefully documented in the study’s expansive library, which has provided researchers, scientists, and medical professionals with the background and data to complete pioneering research in the fields of psychology, developmental psychology, happiness and well-being, and the long-term effects of practices such as smoking, drinking, exercise and—most importantly—relationships.

- The Harvard Study for Adult Development is the longest study of adult life ever conducted, started in 1938.
- It follows the same group of people from teenage years into old age and now their baby boomer children.
- There have been four directors since the study began, but it's hard to get out of the study once you're in it.
- Participants were initially chosen from Harvard College sophomores and boys from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, who were known for familial poverty, severe [[Mental illness]], substance abuse, domestic violence, and other problems.
- The study aimed to understand what goes right in human development.
- 2/3 of the families in the study were immigrant families.
-  Wives of the original participants were later brought into the study.
- More than half of the participants are now women, but the sample lacks diversity in certain ethnic groups.
- The study's uniqueness is in its forward-looking nature, following participants without knowing their outcomes.

## Problems in sampling representations

At the time they were trying to research on what makes people successful, so they chose all white men from Harvard. They understand that it was a feeling of the original study. This was combined with another study of boys from poor neighbourhoods from Boston who were more diverse socioeconomically. Robert Waldinger admits to these study shortcomings.
