## Personal reflections on childhood rejection

[[2023-06-07]] I made a big breakthrough while watching a [[REF The Trauma Of Abandonment  Dr. Gabor Mate|video]] on [[The trauma of abandonment|the trauma of abandonment]]. I've never felt so much better understood - I was always wondering why I was searching so desperately for an answer to such a difficult question of why am I this way - how did my personality come to be this way.

Dr. Gabor Mate also experienced a sense of abandonment at such a young age, and his video on [[REF The Trauma Of Abandonment  Dr. Gabor Mate|video on the trauma of abandonment]] encapsulates all of my feelings, and existential angst.

It's also makes us [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|more open to trying new ideas]] because [[View challenges as opportunities|failure will feel like an opportunity]] instead.
