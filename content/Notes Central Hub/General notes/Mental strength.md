## Mental strength is about embracing personal experiences and difficult emotions

It's important to recognize that [[Daring greatly is to embrace vulnerability and face life with courage|it take strength]] to embrace difficult feelings and emotions such as grief, sadness - and [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|to share it with others]] by displaying [[Emotional vulnerability is the willingness and ability to express true emotions|emotional vulnerability]].

Perhaps because of stigma within society, but we often [[Cultural roots of shame|shy away from vulnerability]] and we tend to think that expressing and feeling emotions is a [[Dealing with weakness|sign of weakness]]. It's part of building [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|resilience to shame]]. For example, not crying or [[Emotional suppression and denial|suppressing emotions]] is not true mental strength.

When we experience challenging moments of life, periods of personal struggle, it leads to [[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|post-traumatic growth]]. When we experience difficult emotions and we do incredibly difficult things which may not come to us [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|naturally]], we are developing bigger mental muscles.

## It is possible to be mentally strong despite mental illness

Having mental strength is different from not having mental illness. It's possible to have depression, anxiety, or some other kind of mental illness. You can still be mentally strong and possess [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]] even if you're tackling such issues.

An analogy which can make us understand this a bit better is that even if we have big muscles for our physical health, it doesn't mean that we'll never have a physical health problem. This parallel is also applied to mental health.

> [!note] A note about asking for help from VeryWell
> A lot of people misunderstand mental strength. They think being strong is about not crying at sad movies or not acknowledging hurt feelings. But experiencing and expressing normal human emotions takes more strength than suppressing them. So, don’t believe that showing emotion means you’re weak.
>
> Similarly, don’t buy into the notion that mentally strong people don’t [[Asking for help requires strength|ask for help]]. It takes incredible mental strength to admit you don’t have all the answers or to recognize when you might need help.
>
> If you want to know how to build more mental strength, reach out for help. Talking to a mental health professional might help you develop the mental strength you need to think, feel, and do your best in life.
