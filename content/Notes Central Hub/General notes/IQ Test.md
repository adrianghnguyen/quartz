Most famous one is the IQ test.

## Validity and reliability of intelligence scores

- At this time, we simply don't know enough to say that IQ is a good representation of the g factor ([[General Intelligence Factor]]).
- Intelligence quotient (IQ) test scores tend to stabilize around the age of 7-8 year old^[[Intellectual development from early childhood to early adulthood: The impact of early IQ differences on stability and change over time - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S104160801400020X)]

## Applicability of intelligence tests

- IQ only predicts short term outcome/academic scores.^[Zettergren and Bergman, 2014]
- Specific [[_MOC Expertise|skillsets]] are more predictive of of adult success outcomes^[Subotnik, 2018]

As a conclusion, it's better to focus on developmental outcomes rather than metric scores to help people develop talent ([[High intellectual potential overview]]).
