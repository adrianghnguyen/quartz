> Personal identity refers to the unique characteristics, traits, and qualities that distinguish an individual from others. It encompasses both physical attributes, such as appearance and genetic makeup, as well as psychological aspects like personality and beliefs. Personal identity is shaped by a combination of inherent factors, such as genetics, and external influences, including social interactions and experiences. It plays a crucial role in shaping one's sense of self and how they perceive themselves in relation to others.

Over-examining this question engenders [[Self-confidence|self-doubt]] as personal identity is a question which has eluded philosophers for a long time.

Our personal identity is most likely the consciousness and our resulting character. This is presented by the philosopher of John Locke^[[Who Am I? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oocunV4JX4w)] who says that our personal identity is most likely composed the following:

1. [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|Personal values]] aka the ethical and moral principles which guide us
2. [[Inclination are personal preferences|Personal inclinations]]
3. [[Temperament are enduring response characteristics|Temperament]]

## Philosophy of the self

Personal identity is our sense of self. It is a combination of our unique characteristics, traits, and qualities that distinguish us an individual from others. Personal identity also impacts how we perceive ourselves in [[Social comparison|comparison to others]]. When put under a philosophical lens, it becomes much more complex.

Under a thought experiment, if one were to be asked what parts of our bodies we could keep, many of us would answer our brains, or the mind. Likewise, when asked what parts we prefer of someone else, a less than superficial answer would be the person that they are - which begs the further questioning.

## Identity is a gestalt

Personal identity is formed from the multiple roles associated to the groups to which we belong. We may be a parent, a child, a teacher, a friend and within each of those facets, a new part of us will be displayed. Do different behaviours in different contexts mean that our personal identity is 'fake', if such a thing is to be believed? The answer is most likely no.

## Personal identity will change over time

At the same time, our identity is always in flux and it can be hard to observe in the center of the storm - it is hard to be an objective observer of the self. Often times, our outward shell is easily constructed and less dynamic. For example, ask multiple friends to describe you and certain patterns of personalities will emerge. We are not privy to the [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] of others and understanding their journey through life yet we possess the depth of our own.

We will respond to growth and difficult times and [[Many lifetimes to live|change as person in response]]. [[The self is an illusion|The self is an illusion]].
