It was interesting that the [[REF Harvard Professor Answers Happiness Questions From Twitter  Tech Support  WIRED|Harvard Professor on happiness]] mentioned the concept of homeostasis (something which I first learned in [[Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]) as it relates to happiness. It's further explained in setpoint theory which seeks to further understand the [[Brain reward or enjoyment system releases dopamine|brain reward system]].

[[homeostatic systems|Homeostasis]] is also a concept enacted within our body at a deep biological level within the [[Parasympathetic Nervous System|parasympathetic nervous system]].  It's also interesting because it's the mathematical concept of [[Reverting to the means|reverting towards the mean]].

He says that [[The Happiness Equation|happiness]] is a [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|hedonic treadmill]], whether we are sad or happy, it always reverts back to a baseline level. In this aspect, the best thing we can do is engage in [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|cognitive reframing]].
