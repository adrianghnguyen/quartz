- The primary finding is that anxious individuals tend to be less stable in [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment patterns]] in relationships which in turn reduces the stability and the security of the relationship.

> The [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|close relationships]] questionnaire was developed by researchers to understand how feelings of anxiety, fearfulness, and avoidance in a person’s experience of a relationship influence their sense of stability and security. In general, researchers found that “people high in security were more stable than insecure people” and that “highly anxious individuals were less stable in their attachment patterns over time than people who were not anxious.” Generally speaking, this means that a high anxiety and avoidance score indicates less stability and security in your relationships.

## Interpreting Your Scores on the Close Relationships Questionnaire

> The following scores represent averages from a validating population of over 17,000 people (73% female) with an average age of 27 (SD = 10). Twenty-one percent of the sample was married.
>
> *If your score is lower than the overall average or the average for your age group, it likely indicates that you experience more stability and security in your relationships. The smaller the number and the greater the difference between your score and the average, the more safety and security you likely experience in your relationships.*
