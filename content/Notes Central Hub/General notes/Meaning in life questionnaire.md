> Life has stages marked by transitions through many [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|ups and downs]]. As we grow and mature, we develop a sense of [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|who we are]] and where we’ve come. We make sense of our experiences in order to understand their meaning.
>
> The survey you are about to take is called the Meaning in Life Questionnaire. It measures how strongly each of us searches for meaning in our lives and to what extent we experience a sense of presence that prevents us from feeling troubled by a lack of purpose.

> As you contemplate the idea of meaning, complete the following survey.

## Personal results

Your scores are as follows:

- Presence of Meaning in Life: **22** out of 35 (62.86%) <- Below average
- Search for Meaning in Life: **33** out of 35 (94.29%) <- Above average

I wonder what [[Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl|Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl]] says about this.

I wonder how much of this I can relate as I align with [[My career mission|my career mission]]

## Interpreting the scores

> The Meaning in Life Questionnaire is a brief scale that assesses two dimensions of meaning in life: the presence of meaning in life, and the search for meaning. Presence is the degree to which a person considers their life to be meaningful, and search indicates how strongly a person desires to discover new meaning in one’s life.
>
> Across several subsets of populations, mean scores on the Presence scale have ranged between 21.15 and 28.16. If you **score above 24 on the Presence scale**, you are likely higher than average in presence, which has a greater association with well-being, agreeableness, and lower anxiety and depression.
>
> For the Search scale, scores have ranged from 17.95 and 26.6. If you **score higher than 22 on the Search scale**, you are likely higher than average in search, which has a greater association with religious quest, rumination, negative affect, and depression.
