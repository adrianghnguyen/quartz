## Flock of birds metaphor for self-organization

For example, a flock of birds can exhibit [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organization]] by flying in a coordinated pattern without a designated leader or controller. Each bird follows simple rules of behavior, such as maintaining a minimum distance from its neighbors and aligning its direction of flight with those nearby. Through these simple interactions, the flock as a whole exhibits complex and adaptive behavior.

Funnily enough, the flock of birds was how [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension]] was described in [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]  in terms of all the sub-mental components of pleasures. There needs to be mindfulness pointing towards [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body-acceptance]]  in order for us to to fully experience peak pleasure (remember reading something about [[peak mind]] of the book with the same subject) which are orgasms.

## You are a gestalt

We are a collective of desires, all competing with one another.

> Ultimately, the “you” that is consciously aware of being a “self,” an individual distinct from other individuals, is a composite self, a hologram built of these multiple motivational and [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]] all engaging with the environment and with each other, in a noisy, messy, multidirectional tug-of-war. As a person capable of desiring multiple things at once—food, sleep, sex, warmth, to be left alone, etc.—you are a collective of desires. A flock.^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]
