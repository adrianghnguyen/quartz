> System 1: This is the fast, automatic, and intuitive system that operates unconsciously and effortlessly. It processes information quickly and can handle multiple tasks at once. It's responsible for our immediate reactions, emotions, and judgments, and it helps us to navigate the world efficiently.

> The dual process model suggests that most of the time, we rely on System 1 thinking because it's quick and efficient.

This is the reason why human brains are [[Brains are biased by nature|brains are naturally wired to be biased]].

It'll be interesting to see this link with what [[Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths]] presents.

Just as any other kinds of systems, we cannot impart of moral or human judgement upon such a brain system - it simply is.

What we should understand is which external factors which can bias the responses those systems or cause it to produce faulty answers. We can learn to [[Preventing cognitive bias using cognitive forcing strategies|prevent cognitive bias by using cognitive forcing strategies]].

[[Mental illness|Poor mental health]] and [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|negative past experiences]] would contribute to [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|poor responses and behaviours]] and our implicit reasoning serving us up with an inappropriate response such as lashing out. It's [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|undealt stress responses which are buried beneath]].
