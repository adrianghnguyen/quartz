The trait or fundamental mechanism of [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|SES]] and [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|SIS]] may be fixed but one can still learn to change the sexual responses or behaviors. Just like in usage of CBT. Remember that this is [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|learned implicitly.]]

We can decide to change our mental processes and use our [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|explicit reasoning]] to reframe how we see the situation.

## How to stop invoking sexual brake behaviours

- Reduce stress
- practice [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body acceptance]] ([[Appreciate your body to learn to love it]])
- Let go of preconceptions about sex
- Create space for your own definition of sex
- Change your mindset on sexual performance pressure

Funnily enough, I wonder how much this relates to success and the mindset associated.
