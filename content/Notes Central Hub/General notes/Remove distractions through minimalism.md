# Practice minimalism to remove distractions and things which do not add personal value

> [!Summary] In a nutshell
> Minimalism isn’t about having nothing, it’s about cutting out things which do not add value to your life.

The core of minimalism is to refine our ability to determine what is personally important to us while removing things which detract or add little value to our lives. This can be difficult as there are many distractions in our modern lives so practicing [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] can allow us to sort through these thoughts. Distractions can make it difficult for us to concentrate on the essential by removing [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]] by consuming our limited capacity to think.

Practicing minimalism, by [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|trimming our lives to the non-essential]], can bring us closer to becoming our authentic self and [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|flourish as a person]].

## Determining what is important to us

Importance can mean many different things - not everything needs to be practical. Even though our modern society emphasizes productivity and capital output, there are many things without monetary value which can bring much happiness and life satisfaction.

Some of those things include creating art, spending time meeting new people without any ulterior motives, having valuable conversations.

Many people can take the philosophy of minimalism to an extreme which is less than ideal as a way of coping and is most likely [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive in nature]].
