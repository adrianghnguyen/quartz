## Overview of the dual control model sexual response theory

Within our [[Central Nervous System]] (brain and spinal cord), we have the sympathetic and [[parasympathetic nervous system]] which exists as accelerators and brakes. Within this model, we can also apply it to [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]] to explain an individual's excitatory or inhibitory response.

Our sexual well-being is dependent on [[Sexual context influences our arousal|context]], our [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|self-image of our body]], and our brain (via [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center]]).

It's a fairly new model being presented as late as 2014 with two primary systems:

Formal name | Metaphor | Role
---|----|---
Excitation or [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator\|Sexual Excitation System]] (SES) | Accelerator | Responds to sexual stimulation and wishes to engage
Inhibition or [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake\|Sexual Inhibitory System]] (SIS) | Brake | Increases inhibitions towards sex and is driven by mental turn-offs

It can be applied to view many different aspects of sexuality such as sexual desire, aggression, infidelity, and other behaviours related to sex.

### Dual control model applicability within the various realms of sexuality

> The Dual Control Model has been used to help explain sexual risk-taking, infidelity, sexual aggression, sexual compulsivity, the effects of mood on sexual desire and response, and even sexual satisfaction and compatibility in couples.
>
> Using these questionnaires, researchers around the world are applying the Dual Control Model to better understand such complex issues as sexual difficulties, sexual compulsivity, sexual aggression, and high-risk sexual behaviors. Prior studies have found that while sexual inhibition plays an important protective role in reducing sexual responses in the face of threat or danger, individuals who have high levels of inhibition might be more vulnerable to developing sexual problems, and those with low levels of sexual inhibition may be more likely to engage in sexual behaviors that put themselves or others at risk.^[https://kinseyinstitute.org/research/dual-control-model.php#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Dual%20Control,between%20excitatory%20and%20inhibitory%20processes.]

## Differences between sexes concerning sexual response

Men and women are different concerning their SES and SIS and how they respond to threats within their [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response system]].

There are some generalizations for difference between sexues in regards to sexual response:

- men who typically want sex, during high stress periods, will have **less** [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sensitives brake]]
- Women who typically want sex during high stress periods, will have a **more** [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sensitive accelerator]]

### Sexual satisfaction is linked to context positivity

We need to identify the triggers which would lead us to shut down our sexual arousal as [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|sexual language is learned implicitly]].

All [[Stress negatively impacts sexual response|sexual functioning]]/dysfunctions or sexual arousal are results of the interaction between **balance** between our sexual brakes and sexual accelerators as explained within the [[Dual control model of sexual response|dual control model of sexual response]].  It provides us with two axes by which to view our sexual responses and how we can influence their behaviours.

> If you’re having trouble with any phase of [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]], is it because there’s not enough stimulation to the accelerator? Or is there too much stimulation to the brakes?

Most troubles of sexual functioning are linked to too many brakes ([[Stress negatively impacts sexual response|Reduce stress levels in order to enjoy sex]]) going on in the [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sexual inhibitory system]].

A sensitive [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sexual accelerator]] might lead someone to be more [[REF-Sexual addiction, sexual compulsivity, sexual impulsivity, or what Toward a theoretical model|impulsive or to take more sexual risks]], possibly related to their need to re-establish self-esteem. This is one explanation towards infidelity other other 'out of control' sexual behaviors.
