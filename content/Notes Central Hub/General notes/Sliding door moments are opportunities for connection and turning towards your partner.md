## Bids for attention and emotional connection

> Bids for attention and [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional intimacy]] create “sliding door” moments. When you say “I love you” or complain about your boss, you want a response from your partner that both acknowledges and/or validates your bid. 
>
> How your partner responds can set your relationship on a few different trajectories (hence the “Sliding Doors” reference). When your partner does not respond or they turn away from the bid, you naturally begin to [[Trust is fluid|lose trust in them]]. The reasons for failed connection are often the result of mindlessness, [[Treat poor behaviour with kindness|not malice]]; however, they add up over time, creating complex and all-encompassing systems of [Positive or Negative Sentiment Override](https://www.gottman.com/blog/weekend-homework-assignment-build-a-culture-of-appreciation/).

## Etymology of the sliding door [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]]

Following more than 40 years of research, Dr. John Gottman discovered something surprising and counter-intuitive to many. Even those who are aware of its occurrence rarely pay it any attention.

Dr. John Gottman calls it the *"sliding door” moment*, referencing the 1998 Gwyneth Paltrow film “Sliding Doors,” in which a woman lives two alternative lives after missing a train. Here “sliding door” moments are the seemingly inconsequential everyday incidents or decisions that affect relationships negatively or positively.

Many couples focus on the blow-outs, like shouting matches, door slamming, and worse. According to Dr. John Gottman’s studies, this is both totally understandable, yet only gets to part of the [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|core issue]] of the relationship problem.
