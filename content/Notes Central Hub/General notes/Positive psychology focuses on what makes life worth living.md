> The field of positive psychology at the subjective level is about valued subjective experiences: well-being, [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|contentment]], and satisfaction (in the past); hope and [[Learned optimism is a skill|optimism]] (for the future); and [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow]] and happiness ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|in the present]]).

> At the individual level, it is about positive individual traits: the capacity for love and vocation, courage, interpersonal skill, aesthetic sensibility, perseverance, [[Forgiveness personal quiz|forgiveness]], originality, future mindedness, spirituality, high talent, and wisdom.

> "The mission of positive psychology is to understand and foster the factors that allow individuals, communities, and societies to flourish….What role do positive emotions play within positive psychology?
>
> Traditional views would suggest that experiences of positive emotion signal well-being and perhaps guide behavior in the moment. The broaden and build theory suggests that positive emotions, although fleeting, also have more long-lasting consequences. In contrast to [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative emotions]], which carry direct and immediate adaptive benefits in situations that threaten survival, the broadened thought-action repertoires triggered by positive emotions are beneficial in other ways.

> Specifically, these broadened mindsets carry indirect and long-term adaptive benefits because broadening builds enduring personal resources, which function as reserves to be drawn on later to manage future threats….

> Positive emotions are vehicles for individual growth and [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|social connection]]: By building people’s personal and social resources, positive emotions transform people for the better, giving them better lives in the future."

The goal of positive psychology is to discover and measure how we develop our sense of meaning, purpose, [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|sense of community]], relationships and [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|positive emotions]].

While a lot of psychology focuses on fixing the negatives of humans by providing techniques such as [[Approaches to therapy|therapy]] for when things are bad in our life.  Positive psychology aims to increase the [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|ability for humans to flourish]] through scientific methods and strategies.

It's a prime example of [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]] and stands contrary to [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopelessness]].  [[Feeling fully alive is about engagement|Going through life with engagement]] requires a certain degree of hope and optimism.

Its core mission is to answer the following questions:
1. [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|Are you enjoying your work?]]
2. Are you living life to its fullest? Also see [[Vision as deep personal expression]].
3. Are you [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|enjoying life]] and being [[Intrinsic happiness is deep contentment and satisfaction which comes from within|genuinely happy?]]

It helps us deal and learn from [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|difficult situations]], such as when life feels barren or meaningless. [[Happiness is born hand in hand misery|Happiness requires misery.]] It's possible to have mental illness such as [[Depression|depression]] or [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]], but if you can manage your symptoms, we can also have a very rich life. [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|We get the most meaning in life when facing hardships.]] It can also lead to [[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|post-traumatic growth]].

## Positive psychology aims to expand our ability to experience positive emotions

These are some of the key lessons from the field of positive psychology

1. Other people matter. All the literature from positive psychology suggests how important it is to feel respected, cared for, [[Gifts are given freely without attachment|given to]] and [[Gifts are given freely without attachment|receiving from others]] to a human experience.
2. We all have a need to be loved and to [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connect with others]] through a [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|sense of relatedness]].
3. [[Elevating others also benefits us|The ones who are happiest are the ones who did things that help them and those around them live well.]]
