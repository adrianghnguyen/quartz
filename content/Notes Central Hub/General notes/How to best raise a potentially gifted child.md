## How to help develop talent as a parent

According to scientific research on the role of families in talent development^[Olszewski-Kubilius, P. (2018). The role of the family in talent development. Handbook of giftedness in children: Psychoeducational theory, research, and best practices, 129-147.], there are some best practices in which to be proactive in the development of [[Humans are motivated to grow|intrinsic motivation]].

- Proactively develop intrinsic motivation through the following parental values:
	- [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creativity]]
	- [[Curiosity as my worldview|curiosity]]
	- high levels of engagement towards parent-child attachment see also [[Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller|Attached by Amir Levine Rachel Heller]]
	- Maintain discipline through an [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|authoritative parenting style]]
- Expose the child to a variety of domains of talents to identify their [[Types of Giftedness and High Intellectual Potential|types of talent]] such as mathematics, sports, arts, etc. without preconceptions or judgement
	- Keep encouraging them even when their interest seems to fade away or dwindle.
	- Remember that high intellectual potential only tends to manifest itself in [[Stages of talent development|adulthood]]
- Create [[Ingredients for HPI Development|multiple opportunities]] to expose the child to a wide variety of interests.
- Find mentors and teachers who emphasize the joy of learning and develop the domain of interest. Once you do find an area of interest, the best thing is to [[Learn new skills through projects|pursue projects]]
- Value motivation and [[Grow by practicing gratefulness towards tasks and behaviors|engagement towards tasks]] without creating a sense of obligation to persist towards the hobby/interest if it fades
	- Oh yeah - I was often forced to pursue things even after I lost interest in it. I think my experience towards it kinda changed once I had my mind went blank, a moment of high stress and anxiety after my first musical contest.

## Key habits and practices in for raising the potentially gifted child

These are key habits and actions which a parent can undertake in order to help raise a gifted child:

- Maintain high but realistic expectations towards the [[Natural and acquired competencies|child's competencies]] and reinforce their motivation so they can keep pushing for [[View challenges as opportunities|challenges]] which match their high potential
- [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|Assist them in their homework and school work without being overbearing]]
- [[Digital Minimalism|Limit time in front of digital devices]]
- [[Ingredients for HPI Development|Actively research opportunities talent development]] to increase the chance to [[Identifying talent types for HPI|expose the child to their talent]]
- Provide ample time and financial resources to find quality instructional materials (mentors, etc.) and participate in competitions
- Provide ample emotional and constructive support during [[View challenges as opportunities|difficult moments]] as the child needs to be shown that it has a [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|community supporting him]]
- Get involved in their schooling and the child's activities.
	- Work with the school to get positive environmental opportunities
	- Find gifted children school programs or ones which allow flexible schedules to accommodate the need to focus on talent development (alternative schooling, etc.)
	- Oh lol - [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] was absent. I still remember how she wasn't able to show up to a lot of my school events due to work.
- Promote social integrations (via things like [[Third Place|third places]]) and [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|strong social networks]] so they can [[Spend quality time with the people you love|spend time with]] children of similar interests who may also be gifted
- Nurture your own personal network with people who are aware and well-versed in [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]] who may be able to provide advice, guidance and opportunities
	- [[Asking for help requires strength|Ask for help]] if you need it form teachers and trainers
- Monitor the stress level of the child and encourage [[Coping mechanisms for stress|positive stress responses]] which still focus on [[Stages of talent development|talent development]]
	- If left unchecked, [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|stress management]] may go out the window leading to [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive responses]]
- Organize the family schedule according to the child's [[Stages of talent development|talent development]]
- Give opportunities for the child to take a break from [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|overstimulating environments or emotions]]
	- It may overload their [[Central Nervous System|central nervous system]] which in turn will make them more [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|irritable]] since [[Mind-body connection|emotions and biology are linked]]
- Reinforce the child's [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|identity]] in regards to their [[Recognize your circle of competence|area]] of [[Natural and acquired competencies|competency]]

### Best parenting practices during the adulthood of the gifted child

This remains important even during the beginning of adulthood.

- [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|Maintain your appreciation]] for your child's success
- [[Providing support in friendships and relationships|Support them emotionally]] especially in difficult moments, failures, and [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|periods of transition]] such as [[Career capital|career changes]]
- Support them in their professional development

## Parenting principles to raise gifted children

Being a parent to a child is difficult - but the task becomes even more complicated with the various needs of the potentially gifted child. So [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|be kind to yourself]] as it can be an exciting journey!

How should one raise a child with [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]] anyways?

![|300](https://www.focusonthefamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Meme-Interntionality1-1024x1024.jpg)

This is a question which has eluded many of the researchers with most of the recent research on this topic dating from 2018 upon which they've established the following conclusions^[Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]:

- Seek to understand [[High intellectual potential overview|giftedness]] and what it entails
- Practice strong values (generational, family cohesion, empathy, self-improvement, individual recognition)
- Practice an [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|authoritative parenting style]] focused on healthy [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|open communication]] and curiosity in all its forms

See also [[How to best raise a potentially gifted child]]

### 1. Understand giftedness and reinforce it within the familial identity in a vast sense

 [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI|Gifted children tend to have the following traits]]:

- tend to be [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitive]] emotionally so they may need help with [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|self-regulation]]
- have [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI|particular characteristics]] such as an incredible sense of [[Curiosity as my worldview|curiosity]]
- mature language competencies
- [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|intense motivational flows]], creativity, complex thinking , and  [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|easily excited, even by mundane things]]

#### Practicing attunement to the gifted child

As a result, if you are not well-attuned to your child, you may find yourself getting irritable. You should try to understand your [[Ingredients for HPI Development|child may have particular needs]] and you should adapt your [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|parenting style]] accordingly.

See the book [[The Child Whisperer by Carol Tuttle|The Child Whisperer by Carol Tuttle]] to learn about her tips on [[Emotional attunement is understanding and responding to the emotions of others|emotional attunement]].

One should learn to avoid [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shaming and guilting]] the child for their eccentric behaviors while preaching acceptance and try to nurture their talent.

#### Practice empathy and [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|good communication]] with your gifted child

Lastly, understand that this is a [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|heritable trait]] and is not all within control by the child.

As a result, the parent should learn to [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|practice empathy]] and [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|good communication]] to become attuned to their child.

### 2. Develop and maintain a high level of cohesion, structure and familial organization

- **Be involved** with your child and focus a lot of **your energy** and **attention** on them
	- Provide them with financial resources, organization, accompaniment
- Don't be afraid of **being intense or 'controlling'**^[Matthews, M. S., & Jolly, J. L. (2017). Parents and the development of gifted students. In Fundamentals of gifted education (pp. 447-456). Routledge.]^[Callahan, C. M., & Hertberg-Davis, H. L. (Eds.). (2012). Fundamentals of gifted education. Oxford, UK: Routledge.] - it's what is needed for [[Ingredients for HPI Development|HPI development]]
	- Parenting this way will not spoil the child, cause them to be selfish nor cause them to become   [[Societal view on giftedness#Myths about High Intellectual Potential|dependent]]
- You may reconsider **adapting your lifestyle** in order to promote this [[Stages of talent development|talent development]] such as providing extracurriculars, modifying work hours, and being flexible.

### 3. Maintain balance between familial ties and individualism of [[The value of family|family members]]

**Families with gifted children tend to be complicated** as a result of the complex nature of their relationship^[Olszewski-Kubilius, P. (2018). The role of the family in talent development. Handbook of giftedness in children: Psychoeducational theory, research, and best practices, 129-147.]

There are two primary and opposing forces in play in family dynamics:

- Identification: How family members see themselves as being part of a unit
- Differentiation: Unsure about this - [[Stages of talent development|talent development]] is about recognizing one's individual strengths

As a result, the family needs to find the correct equilibrium.

#### What to do to promote family balance and encouragement

All of these seem to be about [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|creating your tribe]] and surrounding yourself with people you love. Somewhat like why we have a [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|need to belong]], this explains how exactly we can get this to happen.

- Promote **strong family links** with empathy, communication, [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]] and spending quality time together
- Create and **pursue traditions/hobbies together**; share family activities and varied common passions
- Encourage the expression of each person's individualism and ensure each is adequately supported in terms of resources (money, time, etc.)
- **Promote opportunities** for development - perhaps ask the child to go above and beyond to stretch a bit
- Promote the family as a **beacon of strength and emotional safe space** when there are deceptions or failures especially during learning processes
	- Do your best to maintain motivation and engagement throughout the [[Stages of talent development|process of talent development]]
- Encourage the sharing of individual's passions between [[The value of family|family members]] (ex: seeing another person's recital, etc.)

### 4. Provide an upbringing which preaches [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|active listening]], communication, democracy, philosophy and argumentation

![I use memes to cope|300](https://i.imgflip.com/3euxk7.jpg)

A gifted child will know if you are truly [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|actively listening]] to them or rather just hearing sounds pass through your head aka not paying attention. [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|Active listening]] implies hearing the other person's opinion,  [[Process of communication|understand their message]] and to not think about answering before fully digesting the message.

Listening does not mean one needs to agree, just making sure to empathize with their viewpoint is the key focus. If the child feels understood, they are more likely to understand and follow directions. On the other hand, they might react negatively if they feel hurt.

Remember to share interest, **ask them about their opinions and [[Make the future you want with personal agency|value their autonomy]]**. Practice the value of asking questions and [[Curiosity as my worldview|being curious]].

To truly let the [[Ingredients for HPI Development|gifted child reach their full potential]], they **need to feel loved and understood**. Otherwise, their [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] may be shattered.

As a parent, you should should strive for an [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|authoritative parenting style]] to understand the unique balance between *exercising expectations while being flexible and responding to the child's needs.* It's practicing [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|good communication]] skills.

#### Key themes to encourage in the household of the gifted child

Your child will be quite [[Curiosity as my worldview|curious]] and is trying to make sense of the world.

As a result, they are constantly observing how the world is operating and there are key themes upon which they experiences and their discussions will revolve around.

- Justice, equality and equity
- [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|Values]], emotions, behaviours
- [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|Happiness]], love, [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|friendship]], truth, life and death
- Liberty, responsibility, kindness, etc.

### 5. A gifted child is raised in a household with strong generational values

[[Personality is shaped our environment|We are shaped by our environment]] which includes our parental household and other immediate members. [[Generational trauma|Generational trauma]] can make this difficult and may be a nuisance to the process of [[Stages of talent development|talent development]].

According to research findings^[Olszewski-Kubilius, P. (2018). The role of the family in talent development. Handbook of giftedness in children: Psychoeducational theory, research, and best practices, 129-147.], here are some interesting observations on household values:

- The most [[Stages of talent development|creative, eminent and productive]] people tend to be part of families with strong generational values such as a strong sense of ethics and responsibility.
	- Perhaps re-read my book on [[Principles by Ray Dalio]]?
- **Dysfunctional** families (oh lol - that's ours) tend to raise a **gifted child with a more neurotypical sense of creativity** %% Related to [[Theories of creativity and motivation]] ?%%
- The way a parent [[Generational trauma|interprets events]] and circumstances in life also are transmitted to their child via osmosis since gifted children are [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|well-attuned to other's behaviours]]
- The way parents define [[High performance requires these personal values|success]] having a significant impact on the child

#### Grow with authenticity along with your gifted child's success

For the gifted child to become successful, you need to [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|practice your own authenticity]]. [[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown]] is a great reference for understanding the role of [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame]] in preventing us from becoming our [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|authentic selves]].

This is not an easy road but being able to confront our limits gives us a chance to become a better person and thanks to the child, we can keep [[Humans are motivated to grow|pursuing personal growth]].

> [!quote] Parenting a gifted child isn't easy
> Ce n'est pas de tout repos! Sauf qu'en cours de route, on a aussi la chance de devenir une meilleure personne, et ce, grâce à cet enfant qui confronte nos limites et nous pousse à évoluer.

### 6. Foster development of individual traits of the gifted child leading to talent development

Remember that talent is a developmental process which may only be borne fruit in adulthood and requires [[Continuous feedback leads to change|effective feedback through constant reinforcement]].

Scientific literature^[p.189 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.] suggests the following in order to develop the intense [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] and innovation during the gifted child's adulthood:

- A capacity to spend a [[The 10 000-hour rule|long enough time]] [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|practicing deliberately]]
	- Studies also show how it is healthy for the gifted child to spend a lot of time appreciating and enjoying solitary activities (which may be advanced for their age) such as intense reading or imaginary games
	- Most gifted children who become [[Stages of talent development|talented, productive, creative adults]] tend to enjoy solitary activities during their childhood
	- Time by one's self allows them to [[Journaling is healthy|reflect]], [[Learn new skills through projects|learn]],[[Theories of creativity and motivation|create]] and [[Use little bets to test for breakthrough ideas|innovate]]
- Learn and maximize mechanisms of [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|positive stress adaptations]] in regards to anxiety and [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences|intellectual complexity]]
- Promote [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creative and free-thinking, independence and non-conventionalism]] which will result in creative and innovative productive work in their domain of interest
