# Happiness requires action and intentionality.

My personal belief is that happiness is something which is constructed as a [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|result of the actions we take]] and is not something which manifests itself freely without a [[Make quick and decisive actions|bias for action]]. We are not responsible for all of the happiness in our lives but we are able to self-determine parts of it according to the [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|happiness portfolio model]].

According to the law of cause and effect, *happiness* is something which we experience as there must be a cause, for the experience is a result of actions which includes [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|reframing mindsets]], thoughts and discoveries. It is not possible to become happy in a vacuum.

Competencies allow us to exert control over our output we have towards the world. As a result of this philosophy, it is actions which lead to happiness. The more we are able to do, the more we think we have the capacity for [[Self-Determination Theory seeks to understand how we make motivations related to behaviour and personality|self-determination]] through [[Humans are motivated to grow|autonomy of our decisions]] rather than being left to get carried in the flow of ocean of life.

Happiness is partially derived from one's ability to develop attunement with our brain's thinking patterns and [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|reconciling these differences with our actions]]. It's by acting in accordance with our wishes and manifesting them that we become happy. Doing something for yourself, to see the effort and the resulting satisfactions helps you connect to the world which results in happiness.

As a result, I have a [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|happiness checklist]]. [[Ask yourself if it sparks joy and happiness|Does it spark joy? If not - let it go.]]

We can begin embodying the happiness we seek in life using the [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|as if principle]], even if we are uncertain.

## Make an effort in pretending to be happy and you might just find happiness

> The core function of the “as if” principle is to trial happiness by sharing or modeling the happiness you want to have with others. You don’t need to have a precise idea of what you want to achieve, but sharing and modeling the happiness you want can be the key to attaining the happiness you don’t yet have.

By making an effort to [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|act as if we were happy and successful]], and not moping around or surrendering our goals in the face of difficulty, we can strongly increase our likelihood of success and experiencing happiness.

This is not to be inauthentic, and there's no reason you can't confess your unhappiness at times to people close to you. It is simply a commitment to give what you want to receive and show yourself that you can manage your feelings rather than letting them manage you.

We can learn to be the [[Good emotional regulation can be learned|boss of our emotions and manage our feelings]] rather than letting them manage us.
