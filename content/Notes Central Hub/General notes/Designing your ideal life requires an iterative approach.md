> Designing your life is a philosophy which encourages approaching life as a creative and exploratory process similar to [[Design thinking is about discovery through trial and error|design thinking]] which emphasizes a philosophy of [[Experiment by testing new ideas|trial and error]].

The designing your life philosophy is centered on taking a [[Product-design thinking|product-design]] approach to our meaning of happiness and combining it with principles of [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]] to take into our hands the conception of our personal lives.

Finding out what makes us happy in life will require experimentation, iteration and a lot of adaptation so [[Being patient leads to better decisions|be patient]] and learn to [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|delay gratification]]. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is complex and unpredictable]] as it is a [[Wicked problems are complex and difficult to define or solve issues|wicked problem]] which cannot be cleanly solved with an [[Engineering mindset|engineering mindset]]. Designing a fulfilling life requires an [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative approach]].

[[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|Doing it regardless of outcome is being authentic.]] Don't chase what others have such as the [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|four idols]] or engage in [[Social comparison|social comparison]].

Designing your life life involves managing difficult experiences and [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|telling your story]] in a positive manner such as in [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|shame resilience]],  can bring joy and allow for reflection and [[Growth mindset|growth]].

In order to design our life successfully, I'll need to navigate away from [[Black or white-thinking|black or white thinking]] and learn to [[Ambiguity tolerance is the ability to handle uncertainty|tolerate ambiguity]]. It's a [[Continuous process and cycles|continuous process]] and means that we can never rest on our laurels. That's similar to the human tendency for [[Psychological mechanisms of the hedonic treadmill|adaptation]].

Life design is something which we can engage with throughout the rest of our lives, it's [[Fixed mindset|never too late to start - that's a fixed mindset]]. [[Make the future you want with personal agency|Make the future you want with personal agency]] and sometimes it's worth [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|faking it until you make it]]. I can pretend to have my life together, and maybe it will fall into place eventually.

[[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from moving forward in life and hold us back.]]

When designing our ideal life, it may at times involve changing course and making [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|major life changes]] with [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|significant consequences]].
