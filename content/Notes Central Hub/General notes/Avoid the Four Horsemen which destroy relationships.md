# Avoid the Four Horsemen which destroy relationships through conflict

%% Relationship failure can be predicted by the Four Horsemen %%

We cannot [[Create trust in order to build an emotional connection|emotionally connect and trust]] our partners if there is a significant amount of negativity within the relationship. [[Finding the right romantic partner|It is important to find the right romantic partner.]]

According to research from Gottman, there are four main predictors for relationship failure, leading to breakups, separation and [[Examples of life transitions|divorce]].

Gottmanâ€™s research shows that when these four behavior becomes commonplace in a relationship, more than 90% of the time they lead to a break up. 

1. Criticism, the first horseman of the apocalypse, involves attacking a partner's personality rather than addressing specific situations.
2. Defensiveness is a common response to criticism, often accompanied by a counterattack, indicating a lack of interest in resolving the issue.
3. Contempt takes criticism to another level, adding judgmental and mean attitudes towards a partner.
4. Stonewalling involves withdrawing emotionally or physically from a conversation or argument.
