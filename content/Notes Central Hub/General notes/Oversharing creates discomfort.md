## Reflections on my personal experience with oversharing

### Prior relationship advice as a self-fulfilling prophecy

Airing out your dirty laundry might turn your friends against your partner.

[[Be succinct when communicating|Not everything needs to be said]] and shown so appropriate judgement should be used what we say to others. It also paints an unfair picture of your partner as you might fail to [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|fail to take into account their perspective]].
