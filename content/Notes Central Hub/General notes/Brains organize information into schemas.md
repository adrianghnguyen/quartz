# Brains naturally organize ideas through schemas

This was proposed by the [[Genre hypothesis by Newell|Genre Hypothesis by Newell]].

> [!NOTE] Closely related but distinct concept
> There's a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|conceptual model]] which explains how [[Information processing theory|information is processed within the brain]] which is distinct from ideas are organized.

We can draw related information into [[Memory is processed information|memories]] with the help of [[Priming effects|priming effects more quickly]] due to having [[Neuroplasticity|strengthened our neuronal connections]]. Our brains seems to use [[Gestalt Principles|gestalt principles]] when organized related ideas through grouping, etc.

Schemas help us understand patterns of information and make sense of information. It allows us to quickly [[Information processing theory|process information through memories]].

> Psychologists have found that units—also referred to as schemas—of information are stored in our [[long-term memory]].^[Cherry, K. (2020). How Priming Affects the Psychology of Memory. <https://www.verywellmind.com/priming-and-the-psychology-of-memory-4173092.>] These schemas can be [[Priming effects|activated by sights, smells, and sounds]]. When these schemas are activated, our memories become easier to access. Priming suggests that certain schemas are activated in unison, which in turn leads related or connected units of information to be activated at the same time.

> Once related schemas are activated and more accessible, it becomes easier for us to draw **related information** into memory more quickly, and we can thus respond faster when the need arises. For example, the schemas related to rainstorms and slick roads may be linked in our memories. As a result, when we drive and it is raining, the memory of slick roads comes to mind, leading us to slow down and take precaution.
