# Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important

> Goal disengagement is the process which involves **reducing the commitment** and investment of time, [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|personal energy]], and resources towards the goal and **redirecting those resources** towards more viable or meaningful alternatives.

It may result as a result of identifying a change in our [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values which guide our behaviors]]. As a result, it can be important to [[Discover your personal values through reflection|identifying what they are in the first place]].

When [[Career fit is about finding the right career|finding the right career fit]], it's important to knowing when to bail if something is only going so-so and opening myself up to new opportunities.

## How to engage in the goal disengagement process

> [!NOTE] Inner dialogue aka 'little monitors' in Come as you are
> Our culture absolutely teaches us to have impatient little monitors, with criterion velocities set as small as they can be, which means many of us are easily frustrated, enraged, and eventually despairing when we can’t get what we want—including sex
> \-[[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

Humans have the ability of creating intentional change in our inner voice, such as [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]] through [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|deliberate thinking]] and [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]]. It is a unique property of humans which separates us from other creatures to override base thoughts.

It's interesting that in [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski|Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]], she mentions the metaphor of the [[Little monitors seek to resolve worldly discrepancies|little monitors]] as a gremlin of irony - sounds similar to shame gremlins in [[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown]].

### Questions to ask ourselves in the pursuit of goal disengagement

There are three potential targets for change:

> - Is this the right goal for me?
> - Am I putting in the right kind of effort, as well as the right amount?
> - Am I realistic in my expectation about how effortful this goal should be?

This can be also be applied to frustrations concerning [[Sexual desire is spontaneous or responsive and everything in between|sexual desires]]^[Wrosch et al., “Importance of Goal Disengagement,” 370.] What is more important than anything is managing how we feel about our [[Desire is arousal in context|desire]] versus desire itself aka practicing [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]] and [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]].

## Why do we experience goal disengagement?

There are several reasons why people may engage in goal disengagement:

| Reason for Disengagement | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unattainability          | When individuals realize that a goal is unattainable or unachievable due to external circumstances, personal limitations, or a change in the situation, they may choose to disengage from the goal to prevent further disappointment or frustration.                                                                                                               |
| Change in priorities     | As people grow and evolve, their priorities and values can change, leading to a shift in the importance of certain goals. In such cases, individuals may choose to disengage from goals that no longer align with their current values and priorities.                                                                                                             |
| Cost-benefit analysis    | When the perceived costs (e.g., time, effort, resources, sacrifices) of pursuing a goal outweigh the expected benefits or rewards, individuals may decide that disengagement is the most rational course of action.                                                                                                                                            |
| Goal conflict            | When multiple goals conflict with one another or compete for limited resources, individuals may need to disengage from one or more goals in order to focus on and achieve the most important or feasible goals.                                                                                                                                                 |

## Goal disengagement is value neutral

In other words, goal disengagement is value neutral. Goal disengagement allows us to redirect and prioritize different things.

It requires a certain level of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] - requiring [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|explicit reasoning]], which is [[Journaling is healthy|why journaling]] might help us reflect on what is still important to us or more meaningful.

| Type     | Consequences          | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive | Reduced stress        | By disengaging from unattainable or unrealistic goals, individuals can avoid the stress and disappointment associated with continued failure or lack of progress.                        |
| Positive | Resource reallocation | Disengaging from a goal allows for the reallocation of time, energy, and resources towards more achievable or meaningful goals, thus improving overall well-being and life satisfaction. |
| Negative | Negative emotions     | Disengaging from a goal may lead to feelings of sadness, regret, or failure, particularly if the individual has invested significant time and effort into pursuing the goal.             |
| Negative | Lower self-esteem     | Disengaging from a goal can sometimes negatively impact self-esteem, as individuals may perceive themselves as failures or question their competence and ability to achieve their goals. |

In summary, goal disengagement is a psychological process that allows individuals to adjust and adapt to changes in their lives, prioritize their goals, and redirect their efforts towards more attainable or [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaningful pursuits]]. 

Although disengaging from a goal can be difficult, it can also lead to positive outcomes when done effectively and with consideration of one's well-being.

## The experience of goal disengagement can be uncomfortable at times

> "When you experience your sexuality in a way that creates a discrepancy between your experience and the [[Little monitors seek to resolve worldly discrepancies|little monitor's]] expectations, the monitor gradually becomes frustrated . . . and then angry. Eventually she pushes you off an emotional cliff into the [[Dealing with mental illness|pit of despair]], as she gives up and decides you can’t achieve your goal state."

Goal disengagement can be somewhat difficult at times as it may feel like [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|experiencing failure]] but it can also lead to positive outcomes. This also may mean [[Choose social circles wisely|distancing ourselves from certain people]].
