## Intensive reading is reading with purpose and specific objectives

"Intensive reading involves learners reading in detail with specific learning aims and tasks."^[https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/professional-development/teachers/knowing-subject/d-h/intensive-reading] One of its primary objectives is to completely deconstruct a text and absorb as much meaning from it as possible.

> Intensive reading is usually done in short bursts, focusing on a small text or a short portion of larger reading material. The process of intensive reading consists of closely analyzing the text, deconstructing sentences and paragraphs and breaking them down to the last word, and carefully analyzing the meaning of each word and how the text is constructed.^[https://basmo.app/intensive-extensive-reading/]

This technique can be done by  taking a text, and systematically looking up every word, phrase, or collocation we do not understand.

This type of mental activity is cognitively expensive and may lead to mental exhaustion, or risk becoming bored or experiencing burnout.  This is an alternative reading style to extensive reading.

## Analytical reading is reading critically with active engagement

> Analytical reading is a method of reading and understanding text that involves critically examining and evaluating the content, structure, and arguments presented in a piece of literature. It requires active engagement with the text and the ability to analyze and interpret its meaning.
> When engaging in analytical reading, readers are encouraged to ask questions, make connections, and draw conclusions based on evidence presented in the text. This type of reading goes beyond simply comprehending the words on the page and delves deeper into understanding the author's intention, biases, and underlying messages.
> To effectively engage in analytical reading, readers should:
> 1. Preview the text: Before diving into the reading, it is helpful to skim through the content to get an overview of what will be discussed. This can help establish a framework for understanding the main ideas.
> 2. Read actively: Actively engaging with the text involves highlighting or underlining important points, taking notes, and asking questions. This helps to focus attention on key details and encourages critical thinking.
> 3. Analyze structure: Pay attention to how the text is organized and structured. Look for patterns, transitions between paragraphs, headings, and subheadings that indicate main ideas or arguments.
> 4. Identify key arguments: Determine what the author is trying to convey or persuade readers about. Look for evidence or reasons provided to support these arguments.
> 5. Evaluate evidence: Assess the quality and reliability of evidence presented in the text. Consider whether it is based on facts or personal opinions, whether it is supported by credible sources, and whether it is logically sound.
> 6. Consider context: Understand the historical, cultural, or social context in which the text was written. This can help provide insights into the author's perspective or biases.
> 7. Draw conclusions: Based on evidence and analysis, draw informed conclusions about the text's main ideas, themes, or messages.
> Analytical reading can be applied to various types of literature, including academic articles, books, essays, and even fiction. It is a valuable skill that allows readers to develop a deeper understanding of the texts they encounter and engage in critical thinking and analysis.
