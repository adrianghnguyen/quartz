> [!NOTE]- References from Epstein a researcher on being a generalist
> Epstein's work is influenced by research in psychology, education, and sociology, and he presents a compelling case for the benefits of cultivating a broad range of skills and experiences. The book [[Range by David Epstein|Range by David Epstein]] challenges conventional wisdom about specialization and offers a refreshing perspective on how individuals can thrive in an evolving world.

Generalists are able to wield a variety of [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] thanks to their breadth of knowledge which can allow them to engage in [[Build a latticework of mental models to develop grey thinking|grey thinking]]. In order to be an effective generalist, one must pursue [[Continuous learning spurs personal growth|continuous learning]].

[[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|Different ideas come from various places]] and generalists source ideas from a multitude of fields. [[Range by David Epstein|David Epstein]] argues that generalists are more effective problem solvers because they can draw connections between seemingly unrelated fields and bring fresh perspectives to [[Wicked problems are complex and difficult to define or solve issues|complex and difficult to solve issues]].

Breakthroughs often occur at the [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|intersections of different fields.]] He advocates for [[interdisciplinary thinking]] and the value of [[Interdisciplinary thinking|combining knowledge from diverse domains]].

He provides examples of successful individuals who have thrived in diverse roles due to their ability to think outside traditional disciplinary boundaries which is an example of [[Use grey thinking to see from multiple perspectives|grey thinking]].
