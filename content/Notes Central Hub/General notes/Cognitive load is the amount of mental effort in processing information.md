# Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information


Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information. In other words, the amount of cognitive resources in order to learn something new or perform a certain tasks.
## Cognitive load theory

It's a theory which helps us understand how we process information within the brain.

Definition: Number of **[[Working memory is limited|working memory resources]]** used . It is limited in duration and capacity, being depleted with time. It is the limit on our working memory.

It can be impacted by factors such as [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|distractions]].

## Efforts involved in processing information

There are three main types of efforts involved when assimilating new information:

1. **Intrinsic** cognitive load is effort associated with a specific topic
2. **Extraneous** cognitive load is the way information or tasks are presented to a learner
3. **Germane** cognitive load refers to the work put into creating a permanent store of knowledge (a [schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_(psychology) "Schema (psychology)"))^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_load]
	1. The effort involved in fitting the knowledge into our [[Brains organize information into schemas|existing schemas]]

> [!info] Etymology of 'germane'
> Germane comes from the word **germinate** and refers to *being relevant and appropriate*

Efforts involved in learning are related to the fact that [[Working memory is limited|we can only process so much information at a point in time due to limited working memory]]. The upper boundary of how much information can store in one's mind at a point in time. Trying to assimilate too much information might surpass one's capabilities to [[Memory is processed information|process information]].

## Learning and processing information under stress

See also [[Improving our memory]]

> Because learning is intrinsically linked to the [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values]], **_emotions_**, belief systems, behaviors, thoughts, and **_experiences_** a student has in the world (Jin 2012), it is not surprising that l*earning under stress significantly impacts motivation, cognition, engagement, retention, and participation.* We’ve all heard that stressful life experiences ([[Trauma is involuntary loss of control]]) significantly impact learning, but the scientific evidence behind this claim is truly sobering.

Consider the findings published by Debra A. Bandasser & Tracey J. Shors in _Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews_ (2010):

- Stressful experiences release stress hormones, primarily from the adrenals, which directly impact brain areas engaged in learning ([[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information]])
- [[_MOC Stress|Stressful]] experiences indirectly alter the circuits used in learning via intermediary brain regions
   - These intermediary brain regions are not integral to the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] or learning itself, but rather link the consequences of a stressful experience with circuits used to learn associations
- Stressful experience induces physiological, morphological, and cellular changes in learning circuitry ^[https://otl.du.edu/teaching-through-a-pandemic-cognitive-load-mental-health-and-learning-under-stress/]
