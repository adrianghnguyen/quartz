As Duckworth and her fellow researchers state: “Grit entails working strenuously toward challenges, maintaining effort and interest over years despite failure, adversity, and plateaus in progress. The gritty individual approaches achievement as a marathon; his or her advantage is stamina. Whereas disappointment or boredom signals to others that it is time to change trajectory and cut losses, the gritty individual stays the course.”^[Duckworth, A. L., Peterson, C., Matthews, M. D., and Kelly, D. R. "Grit: Perseverance and passion for long-term goals." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 92, no. 6 (2007): 1087–1101.]

Grit is a psychological trait that encompasses perseverance, [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|resilience]] and determination towards achieving long-term goals.  It is the ability to stay committed and motivated even in the [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|face of adversity and potential setbacks]] in order to achieve success. There may be a relationship towards the [[High intellectual potential overview|the concept of high intellectual potential]] where [[High intellectual potential to talent conversion funnel|endless motivation can bloom into talent]].

You need two key factors to develop grit:^[^[Eskreis-Winkler, L., Gross, J. J., & Duckworth, A. L. (2016). Grit: Sustained self-regulation in the service of superordinate goals. Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory and applications, 380-395.]]

## Grit according to Angela Duckworth

See [[Grit by Angela Duckworth|Grit by Angela Duckworth]]

> In this conversation between Arthur Brooks and Angela Duckworth, Duckworth discusses her background and career, highlighting her education at Harvard and Oxford, as well as her work as a public school teacher and the founder of a summer school for underserved children. She is currently a chaired professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the CEO of the Character Lab, a nonprofit organization focused on helping children thrive. The main focus of the conversation is on Duckworth's concept of grit, which she defines as a combination of perseverance and passion over extended periods of time. Duckworth emphasizes the importance of aligning passion with purpose, which she believes is developed rather than discovered. She also discusses the correlation between grit and happiness, noting that gritty individuals tend to have a satisfying life filled with hard work and a love for what they do.

> As Duckworth describes it, grit entails working strenuously toward challenges and maintaining interest and effort, despite failure, adversity, and plateaus, and progress. Duckworth's research shows that grit is arguably the single most important defining characteristic in the achievement of goals, even over and above IQ.

Grit is the most important characteristic in achieving goals, even more important than IQ according to Angela Duckworth. In order to develop grit, we need to align [[Use harmonious passion to find greater happiness|harmonious passion]] with a a deep [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|sense of purpose]]. She also believes that this is something which is [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|developed]] rather than discovered.

It's not about the here and now, the past successes but our ability to stick towards a single-minded objective even if it has not yet been achieved. Staying the course requires [[Mental strength|mental strength]] and [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]] to not give up even when facing challenges and setbacks.

## Happiness from life purpose and grit create life satisfaction

Base on Angela's interviews, people who are gritty may not have a carefree type of happiness, but they do instead live a very satisfying life through [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|found purpose in life]].

[[Questions to build our happiness portfolio|Questions to build our happiness portfolio]] include seeking [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|fulfilling work]] which can help us [[Incremental goals help sustain grit|make small goals to motivate our long-term goals]].

> [!note] Grit is differentially related to three distinct motivational approaches to pursuing happiness
>
> Grit is differentially related to three distinct motivational approaches to pursuing happiness pleasure, engagement, and meaning. Individuals who are motivated by pleasure seek positive hedonic experiences, individuals who are motivated by engagement seek attention-absorbing activities, and individuals motivated by meaning seek activities that serve a greater altruistic purpose (Peterson, Park, and Seligman, 2005).
>
> In two large samples, grittier adults reported being motivated by engagement (βs=) and meaning (βs=), but not pleasure (βs=- and -) (VonCulin, Tsukayama, & Duckworth, 2012). Relatedly, Hill, Burrow and Bronk (2014) found that gritty undergraduates reported higher levels of [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning in life]] (r=), and that grit predicted prospective increases in meaning over a three-month period (β=).
>
> Similarly, in a longitudinal study of undergraduates, grit combined with gratitude conferred resilience against suicidal ideations (r=), an effect that was mediated by higher levels of self-reported meaning (r=) (Kleiman, Adams, Kashdan, & Riskind, 2013).

The takeaway is that individuals who have grit are more motivated by engagement and meaning, rather than seeking pleasure, and that grit is associated with higher levels of [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning in life]] and resilience against suicidal ideations.

## Grit is about aligning all lower-level goals towards a singular objective - an ultimate concern

> …grit entails working assiduously towards one superordinate, challenging goal over extremely long stretches of time.
>
> Consider Hall of Fame baseball pitcher Tom searcher who superordinate goal was to "[pitch]the best I possibly can day after day, year after year…" Seaver coordinated nearly all his **lower-level goals and actions in the service of this superordinate objective:**
> > Pitching … determines what I eat, when I go to bed, what I do when I’m awake. Itdetermines how I spend my life when I’m not pitching

If I want to become a great individual, my career mission needs to be the lens by which I see all my everyday, day-to-day actions and evaluate decisions which move me closer towards my end goal of [[My career mission|my career mission]].

### Grit is cementing a deep sense of purpose to provide meaning towards our actions

> Grit isn’t talent. Grit isn’t luck. Grit isn’t how intensely, for the moment, you want something.
>
> Instead, grit is about having what some researchers call an”ultimate concern”–a goal you care about so much that it organizes and gives meaning to almost everything you do. And grit is holding steadfast to that goal. Even when you fall down. Even when you screw up. Even when progress toward that goal is halting or slow.
>
> Talent and luck matter to success. But talent and luck are no guarantee of grit. And in the very long run, I think grit may matter as least as much, if not more.

It seems similar to having a deep [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]] which serves as the pivot point for our lives. The sun around which we wish everything to revolve. We should build our [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits|key habits]] and [[Anchors are repeated activities and events which occur in our daily life|habit anchors]] around this ultimate concern.

It is different from [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|self-control]].

## Grit as a scientific construct

### Understanding the nuance of grit

According to Angela Duckworth^[https://angeladuckworth.com/qa/], here are some key things to understand about the concept of grit:
- Grit is about something with **consistency of interest and effort**
- Grit will not apply to all facets of our lives - we may be gritty in one pursuit but not another
- "Grit predicts achievement in really challenging and personally meaningful contexts"
- Grit is about being consistent towards superordinate goals^[https://www.dropbox.com/s/pzt8pmlj7v7rk0x/Eskreis-winkler_Duckworth_inpress_Grit_self-regulation.pdf?dl=0]
- [Duckworth, A., & Gross, J. J. (2014). Self-control and grit: Related but separable determinants of success. _Current directions in psychological science_, _23_(5), 319-325.](https://upenn.app.box.com/s/67xypfb2zqtuacd1jrbh)

> Grit may not be sufficient for success, but it sure is necessary. If we want our children to have a shot at a productive and satisfying life, we adults should make it our concern to provide them with the two things all children deserve: challenges to exceed what they were able to do yesterday and the support that makes that growth possible.

### Criticisms about grit as a scientific construct

Grit may simply be another word for [[Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful or diligent|conscientiousness]] as it exhibits extremely high correlations and does not distinguish itself as a predictor when compared to the [[Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful or diligent|conscientiousness construct]].

> First, our findings indicate that the current evidence does not support the claim that grit is a higher-order construct that is characterized by two lower-order facets.
>
> Second, overall grit exhibits relations with academic performance and retention that are only modest and that do not compare favorably with other well-known predictors of academic performance such as:
> - Cognitive ability (Sackett et al., 2012)
> - Study habits and skills (Crede & Kuncel, 2008)
> - Academic adjustment (Crede & Niehorster, 2012).
>
> Our third primary finding suggests that the incremental value of grit for the prediction of performance is likely to be limited. Grit scores exhibited very strong correlations with conscientiousness and with self-control – a facet of [[Conscientiousness is the personality trait of being careful or diligent|conscientiousness]]^[Credé, M., Tynan, M. C., & Harms, P. D. (2017). Much ado about grit: A meta-analytic synthesis of the grit literature. Journal of Personality and social Psychology, 113(3), 492.]

### Traits of gritty individuals

Greedy individuals tend to exhibit the following behaviors and traits:
- Tend to [[Learned optimism is a skill|be optimistic]]
- Avoid grass-is-greener thinking which is [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|learning to embrace fate]]
- Invest more high-quality effort into their work through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]]

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The findings suggest that gritty individuals are more driven by meaning and engagement than by pleasure, focusing on what they can change in their lives rather than what they cannot. They are dedicated to their current pursuits and put in arduous effort towards their goals. However, grit has not been reliably linked to talent. In most studies, grit has been shown to be unrelated to talent, or in some cases, weakly inversely correlated. (Duckworth et al., 2007)

### Grit measurement scale

We can measure our grit using the [Grit measurement scale](https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/).

I scored a 3.7 out of 5.0 which is higher than 50% of American adults in a recent study.
