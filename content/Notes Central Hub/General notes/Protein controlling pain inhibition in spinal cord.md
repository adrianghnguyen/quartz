# Parvalbumin protein controls inhibitory tone in the spinal cord

> [!summary] Article summary
> Results established a pivotal role for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin in the development of mechanical hypersensitivity. The model we propose is one in which the decrease in PV expression after nerve injury leads to an accumulation in intracellular Ca 2+ , activating SK channels and transitioning the neuron to adaptive firing.

I wonder if there's a connection to [[Tran Huynh|mom]]'s [[Fibromyalgia]] (it's a bit easier to spell in French, then you just change the suffix for an a).

What I'm understanding from the paper is that in our dorsal - *comes from the latin word *back* aka 'le dos'* - horn (posterior horn), the connection between the spinal cord and the brain we have neurons which prevent pains through an inhibition mechanism of that specific protein (Pv expression). They fire in a specific pattern tonic([[Types of neuron activity]]) and when the regular mechanism become disrupted, this inhibition effect is disrupted as it becomes adapting firing patterns. I guess the system needs regularism?

## Mechanism of pain inhibition as a result of reduce protein expression

They mention that if there is a nerve injury, this process, PV expression in PV neurons, may be disrupted/become less efficient leading to more chronic pain (mechanical allodynia). We wish to have a high PV expression to inhibit pain. Decreasing PV expression decreases the ability of PV neurons to fire tonically. Hypothesis is that it's due to HCN channels (helps regularization) not working as well, or SK channels (they kick in after hyperpolarization of HCN to help stabilize the system) opposing tonic firing. The SK channel is *meant to be a form of frequency adaptation* but I guess when it goes wrong, it reduces tonic firing.

This may be similar to [[neural spike trains]]?

## Possible theories for the inhibition of pv expression

- Loss of synaptic connection which would lead to reduced [[Neuroplasticity]]
- decreased excitatory drive onto PV neurons from peripheral fibers
	- Reduction in action potential aka not reaching critical momentum to overcome the initial hurdle of the process
	- This is probably related to reduced synaptic connection strength
