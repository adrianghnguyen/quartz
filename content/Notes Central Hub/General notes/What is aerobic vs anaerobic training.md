# What is aerobic vs anaerobic training

#status/wip

## Aerobic

**Aerobic** means ‘with air’ and refers to the body producing energy with the use of oxygen. This typically involves any exercise that lasts longer than two minutes in duration. *Continuous ‘steady state’ exercise* is performed aerobically.

Aerobic training is good for building endurance and improving your cardiovascular and respiratory function. This means that your heart and lungs become stronger and more efficient, enabling you to train harder and longer as your fitness levels improve.

These are typically endurance exercises such as [[Bike References]]

## Anaerobic

**Anaerobic** means ‘without air’ and refers to the body producing energy without oxygen. This is typically exercise that is performed at a higher intensity. There are two ways that the body can produce energy anaerobically.

Anaerobic training is performed at a harder intensity than aerobic exercise, typically between 80 - 90% of your maximum heart rate and is a fantastic way of improving your fitness levels once a baseline aerobic level of fitness is achieved.
