# Target fixation causes loss of situational awareness

## Definition

**Target fixation** is an [attentional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention "Attention") phenomenon observed in humans in which an individual becomes so focused on an observed object (be it a [[Every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure|target]] or hazard) that they inadvertently increase their risk of colliding with the object.

It is associated with scenarios in which the operator is in control of a high-speed vehicle or other mode of transportation, such as fighter pilots, race-car drivers, paragliders, and motorcyclists.[1] In such cases, the observer may fixate so intently on the target that they steer in the direction of their gaze, which is often the ultimate cause of a collision.

For example, when biking, if you keep staring at something through turns, you increase your likelihood of colliding with your object of fixation.
