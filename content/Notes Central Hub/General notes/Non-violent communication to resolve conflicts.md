> **Non-Violent Communication (NVC)** is a communication methodology developed by Marshall Rosenberg. It focuses on empathetic and compassionate dialogue, aiming to foster understanding, [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connection]], and resolution in conflicts.
>
> NVC consists of four main components: observation, feelings, needs, and requests. First, it involves making objective observations about a situation without evaluation or judgment. Next, it encourages recognizing and expressing the underlying feelings that arise from those observations. Then, it emphasizes [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|identifying the needs that underlie]] those feelings, which can be universal human needs such as safety, [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|belonging]], or [[Make the future you want with personal agency]]. Lastly, NVC encourages making clear and specific requests that are aligned with those needs to build understanding and find mutually beneficial solutions.

> By using NVC, individuals can transform communication dynamics, deescalate conflicts, and build harmonious relationships. It promotes empathy, [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|active listening]], and understanding, allowing people to [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|connect on a deeper level]]. NVC is widely used in various contexts, including personal relationships, professional settings, and even conflict resolution on a broader scale.

## How to apply non-violent communication

- Stay focused on the situation, not the person. [[Be succinct when communicating|Be succinct]].
- Express your feelings without making assumptions or placing blame.
- Use "I" statements to avoid sounding accusatory ("I feel disappointed" vs. "You made me disappointed").
- Communicate your expectations clearly, but also be open to compromise.
- Listen to the other person's perspective, and try to understand where they're coming from.

Here's an example from one of my conversations %% with [[Christine Luc]] %%:
> I understand you have a busy schedule, but I'm disappointed that our plans keep changing. I've been looking forward to seeing you, and it's tough when I have to rearrange my schedule.

### Make factual observations about the emotional trigger

State the observations which lead you to feel the need to say something the need to say something. Try and keep it factual, objective and directly observable to provide a common ground for communication.

### State your feelings as an emotional observation whether it be yours or theirs

State the feelings or observations which are triggering us. Another way is to guess what the and ask what the other person's feeling by [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|naming the emotion]] . Aim to do this without moral judgement or [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shaming]] the other person.

> I saw you crying earlier - are you upset?
> It *makes me feel sad* when I see you crying.
> I feel [x] when [y] occurs

### State the need which is causing that feeling

State your need without moral judgment, giving clarity on what you're feeling and or what the other person's feeling in that moment.

> - For example, "I see you looking away while I'm talking, and you've been speaking so quietly, I can't hear you _(observation)._ Please speak up so I can understand.
> - "I'm feeling [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|lonely]] _(feeling)_ because I'm needing connection right now. Is now a good time to hang out?"
> - "I saw that your name wasn't mentioned in the acknowledgments. Are you feeling upset that your hard work isn't being acknowledged?"

### Make a direct request which would help resolve the emotional need

Practice [[Honest communication is clear|direct communication]] by specifically stating what you need right at the moment. rather than providing hints or stating what we don't want.

It's important to note that it is a request rather than a demand. We need to make it possible for the other person to say no or propose an alternative. We should take responsibility for getting our own needs met and letting the other person responsible for their own needs.

We may need to be direct at times and enact [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|healthy boundaries in relationships]] if it is necessary.
