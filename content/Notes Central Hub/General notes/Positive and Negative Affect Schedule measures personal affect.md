The PANAS profile measures where your balance of [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|positive and negative affect]] lies. It's a key tool within [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]].

Here are my personal scores on this type of psychological measurement:
> My Positive Affect score was 35. This is above the average which is a good thing.
> My Negative Affect score was 12. This is below the average which is a good thing.

According to this, it would classify me under the cheerleader persona and make me an optimistic person by default.

It's important to note that particular scores do not are not a particular judgment of personal character.

## Scientific interpretation of PANAS scores and their mean

> Interpreting Your PANAS Scores
>
> “The PANAS was developed in 1988 by psychologists David Watson, Lee Anna Clark, and Auke Tellegen (Mulder, P., 2018). Clinical studies, as well as non-clinical ones, have found PANAS to be a valid and reliable assessment tool for gauging positive and negative affect (Merz et al., 2013)….[Positive affect] scores may range anywhere from **10–50**.
>
> Higher scores represent higher levels of positive affect.” The average mean scores for positive affect lie between about **29.7 and 33.3** (Hudeck, 2016).
>
> Negative affect “scores may range anywhere from **10–50**. Higher scores represent higher levels of negative affect.” The average mean scores for negative affect lie between about **14.8 and 17.4** (Hudeck, 2016).
