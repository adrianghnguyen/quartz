# Use the Day Reconstruction Method to track happiness

#status/done

Related to [[Happiness and unhappiness are processed in different parts of the brain]]

In 2004, Daniel Kahneman (from [[Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman|Thinking Fast and Slow]]) came up with a way to identify or distinguish the [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|sources of happiness]] or unhappiness within our lives.

This technique is useful for us to begin identifying and having a [[Measure progress using KPIs|baseline indicator]] in terms of what makes us happy or unhappy. As a result, from there, we can begin looking at our [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|happiness checklist]] to identify what needs to be change such as [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|new habits and routines]]

It's especially keeping a [[Journaling is healthy|journal]] of the activities in our daily lives and seeing what [[Nuggets of happiness|adds or removes happiness]].

## Findings from the Day Reconstruction Method study

- People were asked to keep the diary of their previous day, categorizing them as positive or negative.
- Socializing was ranked high on the [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|positive affect]] scale, while interacting with one's boss was unexpectedly ranked as one of the most negative events.
- [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|Negative affect]] was found to fluctuate throughout the day, with the highest levels in the morning, decreasing during lunch, increasing again in the afternoon, and reaching the lowest point at night.
