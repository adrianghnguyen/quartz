Related to [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth]]

When receiving a rejection or something which triggers [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|feelings of failure]] - it can feel like [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|the world is ending]]. If I try to [[Stay grounded and maintain perspective|be more realistic]] and take a balanced account of the situation, what seems like definitive failure is only a temporary setback or perhaps a [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|learning opportunity via intelligent failures]].

2. Am I still breathing?
3. Okay - what can I do next?

Good - then there's always a chance for a [[Non-zero day mindset|non-zero day]].

## Understanding my fear of failure

Some of these intense feelings stem from an innate sense of [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]] which can feel like [[Black or white-thinking|life or death]] as spoken by the [[Dealing with our inner critic|negative inner voice]]. It can stop me from [[Show up and at least try your best|taking the first step]].  It's a [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|mindset of scarcity]] to believe that no further opportunities nor doors will open to me.

I should try and maintain a [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|sense of optimism]]. I feel like [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]] is a strong paralyzer to even attempt to [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|do the things I truly want]]. Perhaps in my mind, it has become a [[Cognitive distortions|slight taboo]] to even think otherwise.

See also [[The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron|The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron]] which encourages me to keep digging until I find the true reason that the fear of failure holds me back.

## Most mistakes are just mistakes. No more.

Most of the time, mistakes don't have long-lasting consequences, despite the hit to our ego or being afraid of how we're going to be perceived by others. Sometimes, mistakes are just mistakes and no more. It can feel like it only happens to us and that's unacceptable based on [[Society provides the cultural message that failure is unacceptable|cultural messages of success]]. But that's alienating and isolating to feel that way when [[Human condition is our common shared experiences on this earth|everyone experiences failure]].

To try and reframe my inner voice into a positive one, I should see it as [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]] being a necessary stepping stone for personal growth and future success. It's better to [[View challenges as opportunities|view challenges as opportunities growth]].
