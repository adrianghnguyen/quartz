Cognition refers to the mental processes involving perception, thinking, learning, and memory that facilitate understanding  and processing interactions in the world. Cognition is critical for daily activities such as learning, working, socializing and adapting to new situations. It is a field of research in [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] and is [[Cognitive Psychology|cognitive psychology]].

Cognitive processes are the *specific* mental activities and operations which we use to think, reason or learn. They are **the steps** involved in the usage of cognitive functions (functions and processes are two different concepts). Think of them as the building blocks in order to perform cognitive functions.

> Cognitive functions are higher-order mental abilities such as learning, memorizing, decision-making, creative thinking, moving, speaking, and problem-solving.^[https://cognitiontoday.com/what-is-cognition-executive-functions-and-cognitive-processes/#:~:text=Cognitive%20processes%20are%20mental%20processes,speaking%2C%20and%20problem-solving.]

These mental processes of cognition include:
- perception
- attention
- [[Memory is processed information|memory]]
- language
- reasoning
- problem-solving and decision-making
- learning
- social cognition
- motivation

Studies in cognitive psychology have shown that cognition comes from the input from the senses, encoding of information into memory, organization and storage of this information and retrieval when needed. Cognitive processes can be influenced by factors such as age, education level, attention span and motivation.

Cognitive deficits can occur due to a variety of reasons including brain injury or disease such as dementia or stroke. These deficits can impact a person's ability to function independently in their daily life. As a result, there are various approaches to cognitive rehabilitation aimed at improving cognitive functioning through training exe[[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world]]ys a fundamental role in human behavior and is essential for individuals to process information effectively and [[make informed decisions]].

## Cognition follows a dual process theory

> Modern perspectives on cognitive psychology generally address cognition as a **dual process theory**, expounded upon by Daniel Kahneman in 2011.^[Kahneman D. (2003) "A perspective on judgement and choice." American Psychologist. 58, 697–720.] Kahneman differentiated the two styles of processing more, calling them **intuition** and **reasoning**.
>
> Intuition (or system 1), similar to **associative reasoning**, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and *very difficult to change or manipulate*.
>
> [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|Reasoning (or system 2)]] was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.[26]

## Examples of cognitive processes

The list of cognitive processes include:

- Attention
	- [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind]]
	- [[ADHD]]
- [[Memory is processed information]]
- Perception
	- [[Brains are biased by nature]]
- Language
- [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|Metacognition]]
