### Other suggested topics

1) “acoustic phonetics”
2) “phonotactics”
3) “phonology”
4) “generative grammar” <- this last subject is something being researched by a friend %%[[Ina Zeng]]%%  and she shared to me these subjects.

## Syntax

It is the study of the rules governing the structure of sentences and phrases. It deals with how words are combined to form sentences and how these sentences are organized into larger structures like paragraphs, essays, or chapters.

## Morphology

It is the study of the structure and formation of words. Morphology deals with how words are formed by combining morphemes. A morpheme is the smallest unit of meaning in a language that cannot be further divided.

## Phonetics

It is the study of speech sounds and their production, transmission, and perception. Phonetics deals with the physical properties of speech sounds like their articulation, acoustic properties, and auditory perception.

## Semantics

It is the study of meaning in language. Semantics deals with how words and sentences convey meanings, relations between meanings, and how these meanings change depending on context.
