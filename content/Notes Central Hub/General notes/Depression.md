# Depression is a type of mental illness

It's important to understand that depression is a [[Mental illness]]. Mental illnesses can [[Cognitive distortions|distort our way of thinking]]. During those time, it's important to realize it isn't necessarily how we view the world and it's okay to lean on a healthier brain to aid with our decision making.

We should learn to distinguish between sadness and depression. Often with [[Depression|depression]] it can be difficult to identify the **source** of the sadness.

## Dealing with depression

### Psychotherapeutic approach to depression

> [!quote] Depression is sadness that has forgotten its true causes

Psychotherapy takes the approach that there is something in the unconscious causing us [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|emotional pain]] As a result of this, realizing what would cause us to be distress would be so overwhelming that we choose to push it to our unconscious. This discomfort is probably related to cognitive dissonance.

The goal in treating [[Depression|depression]] is to move a suffer from feeling limitlessly despairing to mourning the loss of something in particular,: the last twenty years, a hope one would be loved by one's father.

### Strategies for dealing with mental illness

Here are some strategies for dealing with [[Mental illness]] and help mange mental well-being

- Hijack another brain's thinking
	- Create alternative personas or 'wise voices' or think about what a healthy friend would do %%like [[Vlad Pripotnev]] and [[Tim Vieregge]] or [[Lei Lopez]]%%
- [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response]]
- [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|Spend time with people you care about]] with whom you can begin sharing your pain
- [[Mindfulness based approach to therapy]]

#### Understanding the depressed person

For example, we may become depressed instead of re-directing our anger towards the legitimate cause of our suffering and pain such as an absent parent, lack of parental love, etc.

As a result, we choose to become depressed rather than have a moment of insight/realization. We become numb in order to protect us from this moment of clarity. As we are unable to redirect our anger anger towards someone else in the world and is then turned against the sufferer instead. This is driven back towards the subject and [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|who may choose to hurt themselves]] instead.

Sad people become [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief-stricken]] about *something in the world*, rather than being sad about themselves ([[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]], self-recrimination, [[Shame and guilt are inherited|guilt and shame]], [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] from [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]])

It can be [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|often difficult to move through this cycle]] which means that we may require some additional support such as therapy or medication.

### Clinical definition of depression

Clinically, a Major Depressive Episode (MDE) is defined by the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/dsm "Psychology Today looks at Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders") as the presence of 5 out of 9 nine psychological and behavioral symptoms persisting everyday for almost two weeks:

Symptoms of depression and how to identify it

> 1. depressed mood
> 2. anhedonia - reduced ability to experience pleasure
> 3. agitation or retardation
> 4. [[fatigue]] or low energy
> 5. feelings of worthlessness or [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]]
> 6. thoughts of death
> 7. change in [appetite](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/appetite "Psychology Today looks at appetite")/weight
> 8. [sleeping](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/sleep "Psychology Today looks at sleeping") difficulties
> 9. diminished ability to concentrate

Many of those symptoms are a type of [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|ruminating thought]].

There are two paradigms under which to view depression:

1. Chemical imbalance - a biological approach
2. Psychotherapeutic thought

### The stigma of medication usage for mental health

A lot of us when faced with depression or overwhelming anxiety may find a lot of reluctance towards using medication for a multitude of reasons.

It may be fear, shame, etc. I'm not going to elaborate here as I'm focused on energy elsewhere but here are some useful links:
