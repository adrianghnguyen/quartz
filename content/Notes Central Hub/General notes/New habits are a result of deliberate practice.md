# New habits are a result of deliberate practice

## The chicken glaze analogy for habit formation

I had a very funny realization or insight into interval training from sports and its relationship to new habit formation. The more we do something, the better we get at it right?  [[Neuroplasticity|Strengthening the neuronal connection activation patterns]].

I was making chicken drumsticks in the oven and I wanted to make a glaze for them to make a nicely roasted sweet shell. The process involves setting the oven temperature at 500 degrees Fahrenheit, brushing multiple layers of honey glaze over multiple sessions of 5 minutes.

If I were *impatient and tried to force the habit without giving it time to develop as a glaze*, I would burn the chicken (Remember [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.]]). What do I mean by that? It means that I would set the oven at 1000 degrees Fahrenheit because twice the temperature means half the time right? Jesus christ, that's a big brain moment. But realistically, what will probably happen is you're just going to get a *ruined chicken that's all burnt*. That's a metaphor for burnout by the way.

And no one wants to eat that do they? If you do, please let me know but I definitely don't want to eat their food. Maybe it's its own form of **[[mithridatism|mithridatism]]**. I would be interested in hearing about their philosophy as to why they do it though. I mean I have a friend who eats freaking kiwi peels which I found quite odd.

On the other hands, I can practice, *involving [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] practices by [[Being patient leads to better decisions|being patient]]*, observing how the chicken is reacting to the glaze. I can ensure that all sides are well covered, rotating it as needed. I can give it the time and space to slowly develop a layer. And once a layer is set, I can brush on the next. Rinse and repeat until we've got our beautiful chicken drumsticks. If I do it at enough time, through **[[Spaced repetition is superior to rote memorization|spaced repetition]]** [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more#Spaced repetition|spaced repetition]], then I will allow the [[Neuroplasticity|brain to adapt]] to this new habit.

## What are the inputs to forming good habits?

- [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|Time to allow ourselves]] to learn how to develop the skill itself - [[Non-zero day mindset|being kind to ourselves]] and recognize learning something new is not easy so [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure is expected]].
- Understanding our objective with clarity - [[Purpose in life|what are we trying to learn specifically]]?
- Getting rid of [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|friction or obstacles]] which would prevent us from achieving the habit
- Having a [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]]. The willingness to re-examine and [[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts|decompose our habits into individual components]] so we can ameliorate in incremental gains. It's a lot of easier to learn [[Atomic Habits by James Clear|very small habits]] than to overhaul something all at once. Overcoming inertia of an objective with much momentum is expensive in terms of [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|resources]].

## What are habits anyways? a scientific explanation from the perspective of neuroplasticity

> [!ai]+ AI

> Habits and neuroplasticity are closely intertwined as neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself and form new neural connections, while habits are ingrained patterns of behavior that are learned and repeated over time. Neuroplasticity enables the brain to change and adapt based on experiences and environmental factors, which includes the formation of habits. As habits are repeated, [[Myelinization is the creation of informational priority neural pathways|neural pathways become stronger and more efficient]], leading to automatic and unconscious behavior. Conversely, breaking old habits or forming new ones requires neuroplasticity to create new neural connections and weaken or replace existing ones. Therefore, neuroplasticity plays a critical role in the formation, maintenance, and modification of habits.


Habits are activating a specific pattern of neurons in a particular way that it elicits an expected response which can be shaped via [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplasticity]].

When you think of doing something, a certain pattern of neurons become activated. However, this requires minimum potential energy (ooo a term from electrical engineering) which we can think of the friction which prevents us from engaging in a particular habit.

Types of friction could be things related to your mental or physical health, environmental factors, personal philosophies, etc.

In other words, we need to have a specific level of [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|resource input]] in order to transform it into the output which is habit. When you engage in a particular habit, you begin to tell your brain to reinforce this specific network to activate and grow stronger - like lifting a weight.

The more times it is repeated, the stronger the [[neural spike trains|repeating signals]] in subsequent actions. If we extend the metaphor, the minimum baseline achieved, through unconscious mastery ,to accomplish said habit also diminishes in time as you [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|get better at doing it]]. .
