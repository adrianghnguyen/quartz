By applying this principle, we can foster more productive and respectful communication, reduce [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|misunderstandings]] and conflicts, and promote empathy and understanding between people with different perspectives.
The principle of charity is a philosophical as well as an ethical concept which encourages us as individuals to take another's words, statements or beliefs under the most positive and rational way possible instead of making [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|terrible assumptions]] or [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|jumping to negative conclusions too quickly]]

Most people are often have our best interests at heart and care deeply about us - they're not looking to harm us. We should learn to assume positive intent of their words or [[Listen with empathy during conversations|seek to understand]] what they are trying to convey. We should remember to [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|honour our social bond]] and treat them as our intellectual and emotional equals. [[Do not assume malice by giving benefit of the doubt|Avoid assuming malice from others by giving the benefit of the doubt.]]

Also remember about the [[Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer|Illusion of validity]] which [[Attentional bias|might make us lose sight]] of what the other is trying to share with us. Often times, we are victims of projection onto others and what we are accusing them of, is really our personal source of [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|insecurity]].

I know that I can have a superiority complex when [[Recognize your circle of competence|it comes to certain topics]], but that in itself can be a form of cognitive bias, [[Seeing the world as it is is being realistic|blinding me to what they're trying to convey]]. Because I may not be able to let my ego or my [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|past hurt]] leading to unknown anger, reprisal, and other negative feelings to arise in my interactions.

## Communicating one's feelings 

Perhaps one way of of dealing with it is to give [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|more presence to my feelings]] and share my feelings rather than seeking to intellectualize them. It's a form of psychological dissonance or distance to talk about the subjects of my feelings in an abstract manner. A practical example would be instead of discussing the merits of [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|good communication]], perhaps it's better to say "I don't feel hear when you interrupt me mid-thought."

This is a challenge which I have without going into a defensive mode where I feel like I need to moralize the other. I define moralization as a sense of superiority as well and trying to think of who is right and wrong, which is a [[Subjectivity is implied|subjective matter]] when it comes to feelings.

It's important to speak from an 'I' perspective in terms of language and communicate with [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|non-violence.]]
