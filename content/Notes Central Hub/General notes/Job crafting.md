## Job crafting is creating meaning from our work roles

> Job crafting is about taking proactive steps and actions to redesign what we do at work, essentially changing tasks, relationships, and perceptions of our jobs (Berg et al., 2007). The main premise is that we can stay in the same role, getting more meaning out of our jobs simply by changing what we do and the ‘whole point’ behind it.

> One where we still can satisfy and excel in our functions, but which is simultaneously more aligned with our strengths, motives, and passions (Wrzesniewski et al., 2010). Unsurprisingly, it has been linked to better performance (Caldwell & O’Reilly, 1990), [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]], and employee engagement (Halbesleben, 2010; Dubbelt et al., 2019).

Job crafting is essentially learning to see how we can manipulate our work environment, to be [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|more aligned with our personal strengths, motives, passions]]. It also allows us to become more engaged for work and feel like it is a better aligned with our personal sense of being. It's taking a sense of [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]] for change into our own hands. It's a way of [[Growth mindset|imagining the possibilities to see how work could be better]].

As we know, changing our [[Environments and names in computers|environmental context]] can lead to different behaviours which can allow us to achieve a greater sense of well-being and happiness. This is a type of skill which we need to [[Active practice leads to skill development|actively practice]] if we wish to gain greater career fulfillment and learn to be engaged in the workplace.

For me personally, it's [[Learning new things is often difficult|not something that come easy]] because it is not something I've really thought about doing before. There's a lot of [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|cognitive reframing]] to be done and I've learned to be [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|more humble in regards to my past]] %%including how I saw past managers and work experiences%%.

This concept is closely related to the [[PERMA Profiler measures personal flourishing across many domains|PERMA model]], as it is one of the key concepts for meaningfulness. It's taking [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility for my career]].

## Job crafting creates engagement and higher levels of performance

> [!NOTE] [What is Job Crafting? (Incl. 5 Examples and Exercises)](https://positivepsychology.com/job-crafting/#benefits)
> > 1. Enhanced organizational performance – The very act of shaping one’s own job is beneficial, according to Frese and Fay (2001). Proactive crafting is inherently innovative and creative, and at an organizational level, it’s conducive to flexibility and adaptability. In increasingly dynamic and global business environments, it can contribute to a firm-level competitive advantage.
> 2. Greater engagement – Altering the way we see and engage with our jobs can give us a sense of control over what the tasks do, as well as more fulfillment from the connections we make (Lyon, 2008; Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Basically, we have more resources at our disposal, which is intrinsically motivating—it facilitates personal growth and helps us accomplish our goals (Halbesleben, [2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1359432X.2019.1576632)).
> 3. Adding more challenge promotes mastery – When we stretched ourselves a healthy amount through task crafting, we encourage mastery experiences; these, in turn, are conducive to our wellbeing (Gorgievski & Hobfoll, 2008). In job crafting, too, we may seek out feedback and support, potentially boosting our individual job performance (Goodman & Svyantek, 1999)
> 4. It may help us achieve our ‘ideal’ career status – By analyzing our tasks and identifying our [goals](https://positivepsychology.com/goal-setting/), we can move toward them in a more effective way through crafting (Strauss et al., 2012). When we add or alter tasks in alignment with our strengths and motives, we experience better person-job fit (Oldham & Hackman, 2010)
> 5. Evidence suggests that it makes us happier – In a study by Slemp and Vella-Broderick (2013), the degree of job crafting that employees got involved with was linked to how well their psychological and subjective wellbeing needs were satisfied.

## Job crafting requires us to identify our signature strengths

I was watching the video [[REF The test that reveals your hidden strengths by Laurie Santos|The test that reveals your hidden strengths by Laurie Santos]] and it mentioned that we can learn to become more engaged with our work by incorporating our signature strengths into our daily lives and work routine via a strategy called job crafting.

Evidence shows that [[Happiness requires action|we are happier]] when we are able to get engage these signature strength traits in what we do and able to achieve a higher level of performance, similar to the concept of [[Purpose in life|Develop purpose in life by setting a personal ambition]] and [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow state]]. Perhaps it's bringing us close to [[Doing it regardless of outcome is living authentically|living an authentic life]] with [[High performance requires these personal values|high performance personal values]].

## Measuring the extent to which we are actively job crafting through the Job Crafting Questionnaire

> So, can we measure the extent to which we’re actively job crafting? The Job Crafting Questionnaire ([JCQ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312192742_The_job_crafting_questionnaire_A_new_scale_to_measure_the_extent_to_which_employees_engage_in_job_crafting)) has been developed to assess how much we engage in the three different behaviors at work. Designed by positive psychology researchers Stemp and Vella-Brodrick (2013), it is a self-report instrument using a 6-item Likert scale. Based on Wrzesniewski and Dutton’s (2001) 3 areas, the JCQ takes only a short while to complete, with only 15 questions.
>
> With 1 being _Hardly Ever_, and 6 being _Very Often_ (as often as possible within the organizational context), employees indicate the degree to which they engage in tasks, relationships, and cognitive crafting. Here are some sample items.

As I start working this will be probably something I need to consider.

## Types of job crafting

There are three main types of job crafting according to Professor Amy Wrzesniewski, The three elements are task crafting, relationship crafting and or cognitive crafting.

These are behaviors that we can use to become crafters within the workplace and resolve job-person fit discrepancies which we may be experiencing in our current roles.^[Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001; Tims & Bakker, 2010]

### Task crafting is learning to change up responsibilities

- It's one of the most disgust aspects of this approach.
- It involves adding or dropping responsibilities set out in our official drum description.
- It may involve changing the amount of time that we dedicate to its precinct task or changing the nature of responsibilities.

> For instance, a chef may take it upon themselves to not just serve food but to create beautifully designed plates that enhance a customer’s dining experience. As another example, a bus driver might decide to give helpful sightseeing advice to tourists along his route.

### Relationship crafting is changing up our work interactions

- This is how people reshape the type and nature of interactions they have with other people.
- It's changing up who we work with on different tasks, how we communicate with them and who we engage with on a regular basis.

### Cognitive crafting is changing our work mindsets

> The third type of crafting, cognitive crafting, is how people change their [mindsets](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-mindset/) about the tasks they do (Tims & Bakker, 2010)

This is [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|changing our personal perspectives]]. So instead of finding something boring or a menial, we can try and look how we can bring meaning into it. We can learn to [[Grow by practicing gratefulness towards tasks and behaviors|practice gratitude towards our tasks]] and see how our task is connected to the greater scheme of things such as an end customer. For example, I chose to see myself as more than a [[Making a lady's day at Old Navy|cashier at Old Navy]], but rather someone who can add little [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|nuggets of happiness]] to the customer's day.

## Related concepts to the job crafting model

This particular topic falls under organizational psychology. According to the [website](https://positivepsychology.com/job-crafting/#job-crafting).

- Job design which is a top down organizational approach
- Job sharing

### The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model

> Bakker and Demerouti’s (2007) JD-R Model is about job characteristics. In short, it views all the characteristics of our jobs—psychological, physical, organizational, and social aspects—as either demands or resources.
>
> - Job demands require that we put in physical or psychological effort or skills; they ‘cost’ us something. Emotional strain and similar are popular examples of job demands, which can lead to costs like stress, [[Emotional and physical burnout|burnout]], and related stressors when they become extreme (Bakker et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2008).
> - Job resources help us accomplish our work goals and we can draw on these facilitators to counter the potentially negative impacts of job demands. They can be made available by organizations or they can be personal, respectively these are workplace resources or personal resources. The first would entail aspects like career prospects, training, and autonomy, and examples of the second include [optimism](https://positivepsychology.com/learned-optimism/) and [self-efficacy](https://positivepsychology.com/3-ways-build-self-efficacy/) (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008).
>
> When we think about job crafting from a positive psychology perspective, we’re looking at how we can foster or facilitate [positive emotions](https://positivepsychology.com/positive-emotions-list-examples-definition-psychology/). According to the JD-R model, we can do this in at least two ways:
>
> 1. First, by upping our job resources – We might use relationship crafting, for instance, to increase our social resources. Another example is to add to our structural resources (training, autonomy, etc) through task crafting.
> 2. Second, by increasing our job demands – to a pleasantly challenging extent. Think [eustress](https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-eustress/) or ‘stretch zone’ challenges rather than vanilla stress.
>
> The ultimate goal of the JD-R model is to allow for an understanding of how demands and resources interact to impact our motivation, as shown below.
>
> ![JD-R Model](https://positive.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/JD-R-Model.jpg)
>
> Their study also found that:
>
> - Employees with proactive personalities were more likely to be involved in job crafting;
> - This promoted greater engagement at work, by facilitating alignment between job resources, job demands, [[Personal needs as a human being|personal needs]], and their own capabilities; and
> - Employees who increased their structural resources, social resources and specific aspects of their job demands received higher performance ratings, according to their co-workers.
