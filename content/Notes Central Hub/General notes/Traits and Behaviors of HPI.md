We may see a paradox in the behaviours in those with high intellectual potential ([[High intellectual potential overview]]). It is very closely related with how geniuses tend to be eccentric and possess incredible [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals]] ([[Geniuses and divergent thinking]]).

Paradoxally, these gifted children are mature yet immature, determined but unmotivated, able to possess great concentration yet [[Distractions and difficulty concentrating|easily distracted]], autonomous but demanding.

## Main traits of child with high intellectual potential

The child with HPI may have the following traits:

-  **[[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|Hypersensitive]] to stimuli** ([[Priming effects]]) such as sounds, taste, light, smells, touch or fabric types.
- **Extremely empathetic** and even at young age lives their **emotions quite intensely**.
	- See also [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children]]
- Has **difficulty sleeping**, maybe because their minds are constantly racing with complex thoughts
	- See [[Developmental and Cognitive Characteristics of Highly Gifted Children]]
	- Important to make a distinction between [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts]] and explorative thoughts.
- **Endlessly curious** ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]) and keeps asking why incessantly. ^[p.7 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]
