> Generational [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] refers to the transmission of traumatic experiences and their psychological impact from one generation to the next. It can result from historical events, such as war, genocide, or slavery, as well as personal traumas experienced within a family. This type of trauma can affect individuals and communities, influencing their [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|mental health]], behaviors, and coping strategies across multiple generations.

Over the years, more families are forced to migrate and become refugees due to war, mass violence and political instability.

> "Among refugees, traumatic exposure prior to and during migration is strongly linked to mental health problems and psychological distress, and evidence indicates these challenges among first generation refugees can persist years after resettlement.

> Accordingly, there is increased recognition that war-related post-traumatic stress extends beyond the individual to affect families with potential long-terms effects on the health and psychosocial well-being of individuals in **subsequent generations**."^[Sangalang, C.

## Personal reflections on generational trauma

[[Tran Huynh|My mom]] and I had an important therapy session [[2023-11-14|today]].  We discussed that our family does not seem to handle grief too well. We tend to deal with it alone, and fail to [[Asking for help requires strength|ask for help]]. Perhaps it's a strong cultural pressure to be headstrong and be open to others that we may need to ask for help. 

My grandmother lost her husband after coming to Canada and had to take care of her two children, my uncle and [[Tran Huynh|my mom]]. When my mom lost her [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|husband]], she felt alone. She had her mentor at her dental clinic, Alain, but he had to deal with his personal issues with his wife having some health complications so she lost one of her branches of support. She didn't know how to ask for help - and she was in a mode of survival.

During [[2023-11-14|today's session therapy session]], my mom said that her nor the rest of the family took the time to really explain [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]]'s passing away. It was [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|assumed]] that since [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|he]] was often gone to work, perhaps I wouldn't miss him too much. I sincerely wish someone took the time to consider more of my feelings - to make me feel like I have a say in things and what I need.

I also wished that my mom had considered moving to Montreal. Perhaps not immediately, but to think about it in the long-term. To be somewhere she can [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|find more social support]] and not have to feel [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|alone in the world]] with her feelings of [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]].

### Survival mode is the brain's 'Safe mode'

It's the fight response from the stress system when it comes to trauma, prolonged grief or even burnout. The article [A “How-To” Guide for Surviving Survival Mode | Jefferson Center](https://www.jcmh.org/a-how-to-guide-for-surviving-survival-mode/) makes it a referense that survival mode - it helps us keep going because it sees extended threats in the environment. I guess it's a symptome of extended stress. But if we never stop to think about it, we might never [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|finish the stress response cycle]]. 

According to the article, our brain shuts down executive brain functions, coming from the [[Prefrontal Cortex|prefrontal cortex (PFC)]] in order to prioritize base survival - keep moving forward. I think about the [[The metaphor of the rock in the coursing river for standing still|rock metaphor]]. 

One of the gifts I was given, which can help me break this vicious cycle of generational trauma is that I can learn the habit of taking the time to think and disengage from moving forward. There are times when it pays off to stop and reflect. I know that at times, it may feel like [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|getting stuck]] but really it means that I'm recognizing that [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|something is going wrong]] so I can take on new behaviours. 

#### It's okay to stop and breathe

It's important for me to be [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|non judgmental towards emotions]] and that I am not necessarily falling behind in life to deal with the tough circumstances that may have been given to me. I think I have a hard time reconciling the fact that there were many emotional luxuries which were not given to me during [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood]]. There was little time to consider Little Adrian in the grand scheme of things - it's unfortunate but I sometimes wish my mom had stopped to ask for help, to consider more of my opinions.
