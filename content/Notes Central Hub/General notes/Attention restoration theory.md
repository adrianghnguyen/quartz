## Attention restoration theory states that nature helps us replenish focus

This is a theory that came by the researchers Rachel and Stephan Kaplan in the 1980s. Philosophically, humans have a need for nature and to be in harmony of it. This theory asserts that people can concentrate better after spending time in nature, or even looking at scenes of nature. Prior to the 1990s there has been little evidence or scientific research in this field.

According to the theory. past research shows that there's a separation of attention into two components:
- voluntary attention aka directed attention
- involuntary attention aka driven by intriguing or important stimuli

## Restorative environments allow us to replenish personal resources

Within the ART framework, spending time in the restorative environment helps us restore a recovered depleted resources of psychological, physiological and social energies.

Specifically, we refer to the following types of resources:
- Psychological resources are [[_MOC Attention|attention]] and emotions
- Physiological is [[_MOC Stress|stress]]
- Social

There's a field called psychological restoration within environmental psychology, which focuses on the recovery of the depleted personal resources.
