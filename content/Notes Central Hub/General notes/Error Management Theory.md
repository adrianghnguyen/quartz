## Definition of Error Management Theory

> [!ai]+ AI
> ## Error Management Theory
>
> Error Management Theory (EMT) is a psychological framework that explains how humans display cognitive biases and adaptive behaviors in situations involving [[Brains are biased by nature|decision-making]] and judgment. It was first proposed by Martie G. Haselton and David M. Buss in 2000.
>
> EMT posits that individuals have evolved to make a specific type of bias when faced with uncertain or ambiguous situations. Rather than minimizing all errors equally, EMT suggests that individuals are more prone to making errors that maximize their fitness, which is measured in terms of reproductive success.
>
> For example, EMT suggests that men are more likely to commit the error of overperceiving sexual interest from women. This biased [[Perception aka Mood|perception]], known as a "false positive," is driven by the evolutionary advantage of not missing potential mating opportunities. On the other hand, women are more prone to commit the error of underperceiving [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sexual interest]], known as a "false negative," which helps them avoid costly reproductive mistakes.
>
> EMT provides insights into how biases and errors can be adaptive in specific contexts and can shed light on various aspects of human behavior, such as mate selection, social decision-making, risk-taking, and cooperation.
