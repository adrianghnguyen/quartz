- "Is there another way you could phrase this to help me understand?"
- Build on top of their phrases instead of refuting
- [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]
- Ask open-ended questions. It's beating back the pattern of falling towards [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive biases]] and giving yourself to take a step back as a buffer and  [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|allowing higher level cognitive processes]] to allow deeper thoughts to take roots
