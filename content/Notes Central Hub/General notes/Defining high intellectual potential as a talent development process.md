## Definition of HPI and clarifying ambiguations

**High intellectual potential is a set of behaviours, born of one's innate traits which can be developed into talent with enough effort and motivation.** It is a heritable trait.

We often think of exceptional academic performance as the primary definition of HPI but this is a more complex subject.

> [!tip] Understanding the complexity and nuance of HPI
> A more nuanced take on the concept of HPI, is to understand that it is a process of **giftedness and talent development.** It's not merely [[Intelligence as a concept|intelligence.]]

- See also [[High intellectual potential overview]]
- See also [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI]]

### Modern scientific definition of giftedness

This modern scientific definition encompasses the following ideas:

- Academic success or exceptional academic performance
- Excellence in a particular domain which emerges as a result of talent development
- Extremely high results from psychometric tests attempting to measure [[Intelligence as a concept]]
- *Giftedness* is a process which is **rooted in biology** and multi-faceted developmental processes (Link to brain [[How environmental factors affect brain development]]?)

#### A note on terminology difference for hpi between french and english

> [!info] A note on language differences between French and English terminology
> In English, there is more consensus in literature on the terminology, where we tend to refer to individuals with these HPI traits as "gifted", "talented".
>
> However French possesses more semantic ambiguity - whether it be in the social context of *"doué"* or *"haut potential intellectuel"*

## How should the common person understand HPI?

It can be more useful to think of HPI as *talented behaviours* (as opposed to *innate traits*) which **allow someone to use their environmental context and opportunities to develop talent**.

Do note that *HPI is not **all** positive* and can have negative drawbacks, as noted in the case of double exceptionality ([[Downsides of HPI in gifted children]]).^[p.30 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

 High intellectual potential needs to be developed into converted into talented competencies ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]) through developmental efforts ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]]) such as [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]. It is a process which is dynamic, multidimensional and heteroclite (irregular).^[p.19 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]
