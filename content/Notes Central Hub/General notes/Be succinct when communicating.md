# Say just the right amount of information by being succinct

#status/done

> In haiku, then, there is an attempt to "say something without saying it." That which remains remains unsaid tells more than the words and yet is unclear without them.

- [[Good communication requires effortful engagement]]

In a nutshell:
- [[Oversharing creates discomfort|Oversharing creates discomfort]]
- Consider if the information is relevant at this present moment by being [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindful]]
- What is your motivation for sharing? Is it anxiety or a desire of genuine connection?
- Learn to let go - not everything needs to be shared.

## Saying too much

[[Oversharing creates discomfort]]. You don't wish to overwhelm the other person with [[Information overconsumption|too much information]]. You may also slip up and make [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|make a mistake]] - causing emotional harm. Be careful.

Choose your words carefully.

## Relevance of time

Does it matter at this [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|present moment]], or [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|can it wait for another time]]? Perhaps this conversation is going nowhere or it's not something with which [[Remove distractions through minimalism|you wish to engage as it is not relevant]].

Is it relevant?

## Keep the conversation focused

Are you trying to get your point across or are you trying to communicate with the other person? Some things are better left unsaid. Remember that every little piece moves the chess game forward, so it may lead conversations in different ways.

It's okay to not say everything  as it might not be relevant and cause undue bias through [[Priming effects|priming effects]]. Some things are simply better left unsaid.

Or maybe you'll share something with someone which was meant to be private or may upset - disrespecting the person's [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|personal boundaries]]. That's not cool.

### Communication is bidirectional

What are you trying to convey? Realize that the goal of communication is to gain information, not to exchange or dump onto the other. Practicing patience and [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|active listening]] can be quite beneficial. It's okay to leave some thoughts in one's mind and privy to our own gardens.

Others can ask questions if they seek clarification. Good conversationalists know that they should also come from a place of curiosity and sharing.

Also it might not be personal. I know [[Fear of rejection|rejection]] can hurt but it's not necessarily a [[Discover your personal values through reflection|reflection of you]] and it just means they need to [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|put energy elsewhere]].

## Uncomfortable silence can elicit further information

- Saying less and letting people fill in the gap can be just as powerful
	- The implied can mean just as much as what is concretely said
