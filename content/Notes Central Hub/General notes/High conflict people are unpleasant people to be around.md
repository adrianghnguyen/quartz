# High conflict people are to be avoided as they are unpleasant

#status/done

---

They are people who fail to take [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]], [[Black or white-thinking|see the world in black or white]] and are simply unpleasant to be around as they often are unhappy with the state of their world.

If we identify such a person from our lives, who cause us [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|emotional harm]], we should practice a certain level of [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional awareness]] to identify and distance ourselves from these high-conflict people.

Avoid telling them they're high conflict people. It can be disarming for people to perform self-reflection and they might choose to attack you instead - making you their **target of blame**.

If we relate this to [[Entropy|entropy]], *people who are in disordered states* will spread their chaos onto *people in more ordered states*, i.e. possessing [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|better emotional self-regulation]]. Be careful who you [[Choose social circles wisely|choose to be with]].

Another parallel to draw from this is the fact that their chaos is an attempt to *diffuse their negative energy* which we can consider similar to *thermodynamic loss*.

## Main attributes of high-conflict people

### Tendency to blame others

People who have a preoccupation with [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|blaming others]] while failing to take [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]] are the kind of people who would say, "Don't you get it - it's all your fault."

### Possess an all-or-nothing perspective

Those with an [[Black or white-thinking|all or nothing perspective]] fail to see that there might be ambiguities or gradience. They believe that you're either a good or a bad person.

### Prone to emotional outbursts

Individuals with unmanaged emotions have violent emotional outbursts such as yelling, excessive crying, or storming out of a room. [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences.]]

### Act in behavioral extremes

People who act in behavioral extremes have poor coping mechanisms or engage in high-risk behaviors such as drug consumption. Defensive mechanisms protect our ego.

## Most people do not engage in high-conflict behaviours

According to Bill Eddy who wrote *"5 Types of people who can ruin your life"*, he presents the 90% rule: **90% of people do not engage in the behaviors that high-conflict people do**. A high conflict person will display an example of said behaviors but then seek to make excuses to say why it is other's fault, for example committing the [[Fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]].

Bill Eddy states that this is often the tip of the iceberg of their toxic behaviors.

## Possible causes of high-conflict personalities

There are multiple possible sources:

- [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|Low self-esteem]]
- [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|traumatic events]]
- Lack of [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|supportive social network]]

High conflict personalities will often project their anger and hurt onto other loved ones to become a target of blame who is available as a [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanism]].

### High-conflict personality will often have a target to blame

High-conflict personalities will tend to have a target of blame. However, this source of their personal harm may not be someone or something with which they can engage such as a parent, past [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control]], etc. As a result, they will shift their behaviors to *target someone who is available - which may be you.* This target of blame may shift over time but we should avoid being one in the first place.

They might start wishing to destroy us, or humiliate us as a result of their emotional fixation. Their hurt becomes concentrated on the subject of blame instead of focusing on the [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional healing process]] the [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|original source]] of their [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|personal trauma]].

## Remove toxic people from your life

We're the average of the people who interact with us and if many toxic people make up our surroundings [[Personality is shaped our environment|it might affect our own personality]], we will be affected by their constant negative energy [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|which will be constantly on our mind]] in turn dampening our mood. It's also a big drain on our [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|limited personal energy]].

If we think about it in terms of self-care, we often want to spend time with people who make us [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|feel like ourselves]] and make us [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|feel like we belong]]. It's not a bad idea to enact a [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|personal boundary]] in order to protect ourselves.

If we spend enough time with high-conflict people, we learn to [[Emotional suppression and denial|alienate ourselves from our feelings]]  telling us we should avoid them.

Bill Eddy recommends that we should **avoid getting too close to them** if we see such warning signs. However, if we do get in a heated conversation, we should look for ways to [[Neutralize a high conflict situation|neutralize conflict]].

## Personal reflections

I often think to my interactions with [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] where I exhibit some of these behaviours. It's important to learn to self-correct when we are able to identify such behaviors. I was probably not a good friend to some people in my past due to my high reactivity status, causing them to wish to distance themselves from me. I understand - and I've learned from it since.

If we think of it in terms of the [[Uncertainty Principle|uncertainty principle]], you can't see how good or bad your behavior (velocity) is in the moment but only in retrospect by comparing it to your past (prior position). That requires a lot of [[Writing is the medium by which we think|introspection]].
