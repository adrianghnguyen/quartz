# My core values define what matters and how I approach life

#status/done

- Related to [[Theory of basic human values]]
- [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse]]
- [[High performance requires these personal values]]

[[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|Values guide our behaviour like a lighthouse.]] That's why it can be important to determine what they are, which can be achieved by a tool such as the [[Portrait values questionnaires|Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVA)]]. Most of the time, we can rely on [[Gut feelings|our gut instincts]] to determine if something is wrong for us.

I would like to align my cores values with those of [[High performance requires these personal values|required of peak performance]].

- Trust your gut instincts - but beware of its [[Gut feelings|limitations]]. Your [[Mind-body connection|body]] is a powerful sensor for your mind.
- [[Ask yourself if it sparks joy and happiness|does it spark joy?]]

## Curiosity as a value

### Willingness to explore and learn

Curiosity is what has allowed humanity to wander outside the caves and has helped shaped our civilization. It is to look for answers, become interested in subjects and the world.

> People driven by curiosity are on the right track to achieve wisdom. They are not afraid to ask questions. A strong passion is often present in their lives.

Respect other's privacy and remember that [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerability is an invitation]], not a demand.

## Authenticity as a value

### Truthfulness and genuineness

To be myself in all situations, and to not feel the need to prove anything to others. To not be afraid of sharing my opinion even if it may be unpopular. To not tolerate insincerity and falsehoods.

Remember to be tactful and not hurt others. [[Be succinct when communicating|Be succinct.]]

## Discipline as a value

### Obedience and self-control

To think of [[Make progress towards long-term goals|long-term goals]] in mind when carrying out one's actions. To realize one's ability to achieve if one persists and puts in the word towards a goal in which they are passionate.

It's related to one's ability to give up temporary pleasures in favor of postponed rewards (kinda like the marshmallow experiment?).

Remember to be kind to myself and listen to my body.

## Growth or self-improvement as a value

### Physical, intellectual, and spiritual development

The desire to set one's goals of development and work towards who we wish to become.

> People interested in growth are very conscious about achieving their goals. They [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|believe in their abilities]] and do not avoid the necessary effort.

Remember to [[Being patient leads to better decisions|stay patient]] for [[View challenges as opportunities|opportunities]] even if it feels like the environment is not promoting further growth, stagnancy, or not using my [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|my full potential]].

## Excellence as a value

### Mastery, perfection

> Excellent is a path that only a few follow. Every day, they push their limits to improve their workshop and [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsmanship]]. The improvement process is as important as the end result itself.

## My journey in discovering my personal values

I've been trying to determine where I wish to go with my career and my life as part of my [[My career reflections and planning|year of reflection]]. Knowing that [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values determine our actions]], I want to take a pause and look through at where my journey has brought me. 

Every moment in time, every interaction has left a mark upon me. It's time to absorb and reflect on how they've affected me as a whole. I think authenticity is part of understanding where these connections come from: the hurts, the shame and [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|moments of happiness]].

I want to bridge the gaps between [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|my superego and my ego]]. To know myself - my sore spots - is to leave myself barren and understand that I don't need to be more than I am.

Every word spoken. Every word read. Every action and reaction. To make you who you are.
