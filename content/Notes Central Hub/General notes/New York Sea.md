# New york sea

#status/done

## Poem

A sea of endless faces
Where I am but a drop of one
A city of a thousand stories and vignettes
What goes by which we'll never know

## Context

I went on my [[New York Trip 2022]] and was amazed at the little vignettes of everyday we pass by. It's not often I'm amongst so many people.
