## High desire of power personality trait and its impact on early career

> Alpha individuals are often high in Enterprise Control and, like Controllers, prone to shooting themselves in the foot, **particularly in the first two or three years of their [[My career reflections and planning|careers]]**. Controllers want to lead, to manage, to be players; that is, they **want a lot of responsibility and the ability to act and make decisions. It is safe to say that they will not get as much of this as they would like early on**.
>
> If their frustration with this comes off as arrogance, insensitivity, lack of respect, or general power hunger, they will probably raise doubts about their ability to be evenhanded, patient, and sensitive in professional relationships. If we are Controllers, we need to watch out for this, to get feedback from confidants. We need to learn that ambition and a desire for taking leadership roles are to be valued highly but are most effectively realized when **restraint, empathy, and interpersonal sensitivity** are also strongly in evidence.

It does sound like a bit of me. I think early on in my career, I was a bit too egocentric without fully understanding the concept of [[Career capital|career capital]] looking for too many things like [[Traits defining great work|autonomy, and impact]] too early. 

It was a trap and I fell into it. No point in being too hard on myself, we do live in a capitalist society which values greed, status and materialism - a lesson shared in [[Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom|Tuesdays with Morrie by Mitch Albom]].

It might be worth [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|letting thoughts flow by]] and to keep practicing [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional intelligence]]. Now that I'm aware of who I am, I can see how I can [[Stages involved in behavioral change|become a better person]].

Maybe if I had stayed longer I would've had more opportunities. It is what it is. Stay in the present and work day by day.
