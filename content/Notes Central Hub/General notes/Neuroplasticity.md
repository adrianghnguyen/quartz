> Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a process that involves adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. It is defined as the ability of the nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI).^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/#:~:text=It%20is%20defined%20as%20the,traumatic%20brain%20injury%20(TBI).]

## Synaptic plasticity explains the ability of neuron signal connections and their signal strengths

> [!Summary] Explained simply
> In your brain, there are neural paths called synapses which represent your brain activity. These networks represent how information flows within our brain such as learning and memory, or in other words, how we think. These networks and their connections can change in strength based on stimuli from our senses, such as what we think, read, etc. Likewise, the opposite is true, synaptic networks which are less used become pruned.
>
> We can reinforce specific ways of thinking by repeating them over a period of time. Similar to how one would go to the gym to train a muscle, so can the brain and the ways it thinks.

> Historically, it was generally thought that the role of the synapse was to simply transfer information between one neuron and another neuron or between a neuron and a muscle cell.
>
> In addition, it was thought that these connections, once established during development, were relatively fixed in their strength, much like a solder joint between two electronic components.
>
> One exciting development in neurobiology over the past forty years is the realization that most synapses are extremely plastic; they are able to change their strength as a result of either their own activity or through activity in another pathway. Many think that this synaptic plasticity is central to understanding the mechanisms of learning and memory.
>
> There are two general forms of synaptic plasticity, intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic mechanisms, also known as homosynaptic mechanisms, refer to changes in the strength of a synapse that are brought about by its own activity. (Homo from the Greek meaning the same.) 
>
> **Extrinsic plasticity**, or **heterosynaptic plasticity**, is a change in the strength of a synapse brought about by activity in another pathway.^[https://nba.uth.tmc.edu/neuroscience/m/s1/chapter07.html#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20general%20forms,the%20Greek%20meaning%20the%20same.)]
