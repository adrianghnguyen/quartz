# Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

## Overview

Related to [[2023-02-17]]

I learned that ADHD is a neuro-genetic disorder and with our current limits on science, people must use medication.

We think that it's related to attention but rather it's a problem of intention with people knowing what they need to do, but unable to perform the proper [[Notes Central Hub/General notes/Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive strategies]].

Aside from medication, therapy should be focused on creating mental scaffoldings to rein it in and bring willpower through external systems such as [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|reminders]], etc.

Back of the brain focuses on executing decisions (performance) while the front is the knowledge center.

As part of the externalization process, the clinical psychologist recommends incorporating the body (manual component) to a task such as providing a prop/toy, etc.

## Current state of research in ADHD

### Meta-analysis of neuroanatomy of ADHD as of [[2023-02-17]]

- Key points
	- ADHD is associated with impaired executive functions which includes attention as well as other complex cognitive tasks like verbal reasoning (explaining concepts [[Words are inherently reductive|using words]])^[Demontis, D., Walters, G. B., Athanasiadis, G., Walters, R., Therrien, K., Nielsen, T. T., … & Børglum, A. D. (2023). Genome-wide analyses of ADHD identify 27 risk loci, refine the genetic architecture and implicate several cognitive domains. Nature Genetics, 1-11.]
	- ADHD patients often require the support of medication (more effective) with non-pharmaceutical approaches (help support after medical stabilization). Stimulants tend to be more effective but are more susceptible to abuse. ^[Faraone, S. V., Banaschewski, T., Coghill, D., Zheng, Y., Biederman, J., Bellgrove, M. A., … & Wang, Y. (2021).

#### Summary of findings from medical consensus on ADHD in 2021

- The syndrome we now call ADHD has been described in the medical literature since 1775.
- When made by a licensed clinician, the diagnosis of ADHD is well-defined and valid at all ages, even in the presence of other psychiatric disorders, which is common.
- ADHD is more common in males and occurs in 5.9 % of youth and 2.5 % of adults. It has been found in studies from Europe, Scandinavia, Australia, Asia, the Middle East, South America, and North America.
- ADHD is rarely caused by a single genetic or environmental risk factor but most cases of ADHD are caused by the combined effects of many genetic and environmental risks each having a very small effect.
- People with ADHD often show impaired performance on psychological tests of brain functioning, but these tests cannot be used to diagnose ADHD.
- Neuroimaging studies find small differences in the structure and functioning of the brain between people with and without ADHD.
	- These differences cannot be used to diagnose ADHD.
- People with ADHD are at increased risk for obesity, asthma, allergies, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep problems, psoriasis, epilepsy, sexually transmitted infections, abnormalities of the eye, immune disorders, and metabolic disorders.
- People with ADHD are at increased risk for low quality of life, substance use disorders, accidental injuries, educational underachievement, unemployment, gambling, teenage pregnancy, difficulties socializing, delinquency, suicide, and premature death.
- Studies of economic burden show that ADHD costs society hundreds of billions of dollars each year, worldwide.
- Regulatory agencies around the world have determined that several medications are safe and effective for reducing the symptoms of ADHD as shown by randomized controlled clinical trials.
- Treatment with ADHD medications reduces accidental injuries, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, educational underachievement, bone fractures, sexually transmitted infections, depression, suicide, criminal activity and teenage pregnancy.
- The adverse effects of medications for ADHD are typically mild and can be addressed by changing the dose or the medication.
- The stimulant medications for ADHD are more effective than non-stimulant medications but are also more likely to be diverted, misused, and abused.
- Non-medication treatments for ADHD are less effective than medication treatments for ADHD symptoms, but are frequently useful to help problems that remain after medication has been optimized.

#### Genetic architecture of ADHD study

> Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder with a major genetic component. Here, we present a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of ADHD comprising 38,691 individuals with ADHD and 186,843 controls. We identified 27 genome-wide significant loci, highlighting 76 potential risk genes enriched among genes expressed particularly in early brain development.
>
> Overall, ADHD genetic risk was associated with several brain-specific neuronal subtypes and midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In exome-sequencing data from 17,896 individuals, we identified an increased load of rare protein-truncating variants in ADHD for a set of risk genes enriched with probable causal common variants, potentially implicating SORCS3 in ADHD by both common and rare variants. Bivariate Gaussian mixture modeling estimated that 84–98% of ADHD-influencing variants are shared with other psychiatric disorders. In addition, common-variant ADHD risk was associated with impaired complex cognition such as verbal reasoning and a range of executive functions, including attention.^[[Genome-wide analyses of ADHD identify 27 risk loci, refine the genetic architecture and implicate several cognitive domains | Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01285-8)]

## Personal reflections about ADHD

Wait do I have ADHD? I use all these adaptive strategies in my daily life lmao. Or is it more of a spectrum of attention? Or do we just not know enough? If medication can help with ADHD, wouldn't that mean there's a neurotransmitter that's in play?

[[2023-07-07]] No - I don't believe I do. However, according to [[REF The Trauma Of Abandonment  Dr. Gabor Mate|The Trauma Of Abandonment Dr. Gabor Mate]], ADHD can be a manifestation of [[disassociation is tuning out as an adaptive response|tuning out as an adaptive response to stress]].

[[2023-07-20]] [[REF Overexcitabilities Windows into the inner world of the gifted|According to Lindah Silverman]], ADHD can be misconstrued with [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI|traits of HPI]].
