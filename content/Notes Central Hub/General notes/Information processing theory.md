# Information processing theory explains how information becomes encoded into our memories

#status/done

Information processing theory isÂ **an approach to cognitive development studies that aims to explain how information is encoded into [[Memory is processed information|memory]]**. Simply explained, it's like comparing the human brain to a computer or basic processor. 

This model believes that humans process information in a sequential or linear model with information being stored at its relevant stage. This is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|conceptual model]] to help us understand how information gets processed and encoded within our brains.

It is based on the idea that humans do not merely respond to stimuli from the environment. Instead, humans process the information they receive.^[https://research.com/education/what-is-information-processing-theory#:~:text=Information%20processing%20theory%20is%20an,process%20the%20information%20they%20receive.]

Apparently this model is being used to understand [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]].
