## What is high intellectual potential and its related terminology like giftedness, talent, etc.?

> [!NOTE] Shortened form of High Intellectual Potential

- [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|High intellectual potential  is the modern scientific concept consolidating views on talent, giftedness and potential for intelligence.]]
- High intellectual potential is a set of behaviours, born of one's innate traits which *can* be developed into talent with **enough effort and [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|motivation]]**. It is heritable.

## What are the forms by which high intellectual potential can manifest itself?

- If a child has [[Types of Potential Talent|potential for talent]] , it may manifest itself as above average [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]] in a variety of ways such as sports, a musical ear, logic/reasoning, or social skills. It is possible for a child to be gifted in one ore more categories.
- To give a greater umbrella of classification of the manifestation of high intellectual potential, we can consider it as [[Types of Giftedness and High Intellectual Potential|laminar (homogenous) or complex (heterogenous)]].
	- In simpler terms, there are two main archetypes: the 'scientist' and the 'creative artist'. A child is more likely than not to be a mix of both.

## What does a high intellectual potential child look like and behave?

- At first sight, they may look like child who seems to be quite quick at grasping new subjects, with a vigorous ability to [[Transform information into knowledge|learn]].
- Someone who is immensely [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI|curious, lucid, asks a lot of questions and with an interest in complex subjects]]. They might possess above average energy, imagination and creativity.

## What role does high intellectual potential play in our society?

- There are many [[Societal view on giftedness|myths and misunderstandings within our society]] on what giftedness implies.
- [[Talent is dedication by few|Not every child has the potential for talent]] as part of it is due to inherent biological factors. Remember that high intellectual potential is a talent development process which still requires enormous effort and deliberate practice.

## What are the related scientific theories surrounding intelligence, giftedness and talent?

### Scientific theories on intelligence and high intellectual potential

- Scientists have tried to find a grand theory explaining the roots of humans' [[General Intelligence Factor|general intelligence aka 'g' factor]] but have not yet come to a consensus.
- Current belief posits that we have [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences|multiple types of intelligence sectors]] within our brain depending on the activity.
- Our [[Three Ring Conception of Giftedness by Renzulli|main conceptual model of giftedness]] stems from Renzulli's three defining pillars of the gifted child:
	- Above average [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]]
	- [[Theories of creativity and motivation|Creativity]]
	- [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals]] or [[Talent is dedication by few|incredible commitment to task performance]]

### Potential theories on biological advantage as to why gifted children perform better

- [[Theory of Neural Efficiency|'Smarter' brains process glucose, its energy source, more efficiently]]
- Gifted children have [[Developmental and Cognitive Characteristics of Highly Gifted Children|more efficient REM sleep cycles]], allowing them to sleep less while processing more information in a shorter amount of time sleep.

## What is the double-edged sword of high intellectual potential?

- Giftedness is a strength, while [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|twice exceptionality]] (ADHD, learning difficulties, autism spectrum disorder, and/or mental health issues) is a vulnerability in potentially talented children.

## What do we mean by giftedness is talent development process?

Most gifted children will not realize the [[Stages of talent development|full potential of their talent until the third stage of talent development - the culmination phase]] which only typically occurs during adulthood. 

This long journey towards high performance requires [[Talent is dedication by few|enormous dedication from the gifted child]] to pursue deliberate practice in a domain of interest.

However, all of this can only happen with the [[Ingredients for HPI Development|combination of chance, and a multitude of factors]].

Type of factor | Details
--|--
Internal or innate | Creativity, motivation, above average competencies
External or [[You are shaped by your product of your environment|environmental]] | Mentorship, opportunities of development, support of their community

## What do parents need to know about their potentially gifted child?

The first step is to [[Identifying talent types for HPI|identify if your child has potential talents]]. Some indicators might include your potentially gifted child having [[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI|earlier developmental milestones]] than their peers.

If parents wish to help their potentially gifted child develop talent, they should implement [[How to best raise a potentially gifted child|best practices, as supported by research, in regards to raising the child]] such as practicing **empathy**, providing **unconditional support** and **listening actively** to their unique sensitive needs and emotions.

These recommendations stem from the following [[How to best raise a potentially gifted child|parenting principles for gifted children development]]:

- Practice an [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|authoritative parenting style]]
- Encourage the development of strong values (family cohesion, self-improvement, etc.)
- Seek to understand the exceptional nature of giftedness

Gifted children have particular [[Educational Needs of Gifted Children|educational needs]] such as need for autonomy, initiative, and complex challenges.
