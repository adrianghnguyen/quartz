# Trauma is involuntary loss of control and going into shock

#status/done


Trauma occurs when we lose control over our body through external forces (car accident, [[Sexual trauma|sexual violence]]). Our [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|survival mechanism]] may decide to kick in: we freeze up, feel numb, or even feel paralyzed (tonic immobility) or get an out of body experience (sense of disembodiment). It is not always isolated to one specific incident or [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|stressor]].

Here are some possible forms of trauma:

- It can be a response to [[Types of stress|persistent distress]] or ongoing abuse (such as [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|emotional neglect]])
- Relationship where [[Sexual trauma|sex is unwanted (sexual trauma)]]  - even though it may seem consensual, a person may feel trapped in the relationship
- [[Generational trauma]]
- [[Refugee trauma|Refugee trauma]]

[[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|Healing from emotional pain is a choice]] which must be done consciously and merely surviving through it is not enough. There must be a conscious decision to undergo this journey of healing.

## Why the brain experiences trauma

> Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the nature of trauma and how the brain processes and constructs traumatic experiences. She highlights that words like "negative mood," "stress," and "trauma" all refer to experiences that are energetically costly for the brain. Trauma is not something that is physically marked in the body; rather, it's the brain's predictions and interpretations that lead to the re-experiencing of traumatic events. The brain continuously prepares the body to handle threats, creating a cycle of heightened predictions and reactions. However, Barrett emphasizes that these predictions can be changed and managed through various methods, such as yoga, psychedelics, dance therapy, and theater, which help alter the brain's predictions and break the cycle.

> **Key Takeaways:**
>
> 1. **Trauma and Negative Experiences:** Terms like "trauma," "negative mood," and "stress" all involve experiences that demand a lot of brain energy. These experiences are constructed by the brain and are not trivialized by acknowledging their construction.
> 2. **Power of Predictions:** The brain heavily relies on predictions for managing experiences. Trauma arises when an adverse event is weighted heavily in the brain's future predictions. The brain continually reinforces these connections, leading to re-experiencing traumatic events.
> 3. **Continuous Preparation:** The brain creates a model of the world as threatening and constantly prepares the body to deal with threats. Trauma is a result of this ongoing prediction process, with the brain not updating itself and causing the cycle to persist.
> 4. **Body and Brain Connection:** The idea that trauma is physically marked on the body is flawed. The experience of the body is constructed and felt in the brain. [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|Healing from trauma]] involves changing the brain's predictions and not altering the body.
> 5. **Methods for Recovery:** Treatments like yoga, psychedelics, dance therapy, and theater can help alter predictions, leading to recovery from trauma. These methods create new experiences that expand the brain's ability to predict differently.
> 6. **Scientific Approach:** The brain functions like a scientist with hypotheses about sensations and emotions. [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|Testing and seeking more information]] help manage arousal and uncertainty related to traumatic experiences.
> 7. **Control Over Predictions:** While traumatic memories may resurface, they don't need to dominate brain predictions. [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|Recovery]] involves managing the content and breaking the cycle of traumatic predictions, offering a sense of control.

> Lisa Feldman Barrett's perspective underscores the significance of understanding how trauma is processed in the brain and how interventions can change the way the brain predicts and reacts to these experiences.

Would the power of predictions be related to the [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|mind's tendency for prospection]]?

## Traumatic experiences leads to reality disengagement

Each individual survivors' experience is unique but one of the common factors is disengagement with reality.

After a while, the person may recognize that trauma has occurred which will be followed by troubled memories as well as anger/panic/rage underneath one's ability to survive. They may even experience [[disassociation is tuning out as an adaptive response|disassociation]]. %%That happened to [[Melodie Zhou]] during our first times together. I feel for her and her possibly traumatic past ):%%

> And afterward, that illusion of unreality gradually degrades, disintegrating under the weight of physical existence and burdened [[Memory is processed information]]. The tentative recognition that this thing has actually happened incrementally unlocks the panic and rage that couldnâ€™t find their way to the surface before, buried as they were under the overmastering mandate to survive.

## Car accidents cause trauma

> [!NOTE] Car dependency
> Wait a minute, if car accidents are a major cause of trauma in our modern society, that's an argument for reducing car dependency from a psychological aspect.

[[Gia-Hien Nguyen|My father]] has also passed away due to an unfortunate car accident - it's probably why reducing [[urbanism|car dependency]] is so important to me.
