# Empathy is the ability to relate to others and understand their emotions

Empathy plays a key role in our ability to relate to others and [[Make more friends by expanding our network of friendships|make friends]]. It's [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|recognizing their experiences as valid]] and [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|makes us feel connected to them]]

Neurologically, we release [[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|oxytocin]] when we engage in moments of empathy.

It allows us to sense other people's emotions as well as the ability to image what they might be thinking or feeling. It increases our ability for [[Forgiveness increases our physical and mental well-being|Forgiveness which increases our physical and mental well-being]].

> [!NOTE]- Empathy from an organism perspective
> As Cacioppo et al.^[Decety, Jean, Norman, Greg J., Berntson, Gary G., and Cacioppo, John T. "A neurobehavioral evolutionary perspective on the mechanisms underlying empathy." Progress in Neurobiology 98, no. 1 (2012): 38–48.] have noted, scientifically speaking, “Although organisms can develop a variety of understanding of others, empathy entails more than just understanding or expectations. When individuals empathize, they vicariously feel the emotions of others, which not only promote affective communication but depending on the context and social relationships may motivate to behave pro-socially towards other conspecifics [other members of a species].”
