# Working memory is limited in capacity that is depleted over time

## Narrow limits of change principle

The principle that working memory is limited in capacity and is depleted over time is called the narrow limits change principle, just like [[Self-regulation is a limited resource that can be depleted over time|self-regulation]]. This also impacts our decision-making ability so it is important to make conscious efforts by [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|being mindful]] to direct our energy towards causes which bring value to our life and [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|trimming our lives to the essential]]. 

I believe it's something discussed within Deep Work by Cal Newport. This is taking the stance of [[Remove distractions through minimalism|minimalism to remove distractions]].

## The magical number seven plus or minus 2

In a famous paper, “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information” (1956), Miller proposed as a **law of human cognition and information processing that humans can effectively process no more than seven units, or chunks, of information, plus or minus two pieces of information, at any given time.** That limit applied to short-term memory and to a number of other [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world]], such as distinguishing different sound tones and perceiving objects at a glance.
