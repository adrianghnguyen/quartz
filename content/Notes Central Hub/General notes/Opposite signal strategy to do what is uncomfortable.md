By doing so, we can override our instincts and prevent our limbic system from hijacking our [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|executive thoughts]]. However, it can be important to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|honour our feelings]] which might signal us that we're [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|chasing the wrong objectives]].
