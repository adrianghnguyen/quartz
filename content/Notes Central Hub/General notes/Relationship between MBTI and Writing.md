# How our MBTI affects our writing style

> Jensen and DiTiberio (1984) have used the [Learning style MBTI](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Learning_style#MBTI "Learning style") to tailor instruction in remedial pre-writing and writing strategies and processes for graduate students and have succeeded (qualitatively) in reducing students perceived anxiety over writing tasks and writing blocks.

What I am noticing is that the goal in teaching based on the various MBTI types is to give them balance to their learning style. People will have a certain natural learning style with its strengths. The goal of a teacher should be to encourage them how they can mitigate the drawbacks of their writing style, provided as gentle feedback.

### Extroverts vs introverts mbti in writing

*Extroverts* generate ideas in freeflow text and discussions with little planning. The researchers encourage them to brain dump then focus on curation/organizations as the subsequent steps.

*Introverts* follow the more rigid process of outlining/planning, writing and revising. They need to form clear ideas before being able to commit to writing. To encourage this style, one should encourage *openness* to the emerging ideas ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]). Perhaps jotting down fleeting thoughts or leaving thought bread crumbs is a good way to encourage this.

### Sensing vs intuition mbti in writing

*Sensing* types focus on collection of data which is concrete without putting much emphasis on overall meaning. Providing specific instructions, detailed examples and asking them to think about a thesis/summaries will help them providing direction to their ideas.

*Intuitive* types focus more on big pictures/concepts while leaving details for a later time. They tend to think in a freeflow form preferring to focus on the concepts first with the supporting details/facts in later revision cycles. Such types should be encouraged to clarify ideas and provide additional facts/examples.

### Thinking vs feeling mbti in writing

*Thinking* types tend to have pre-conceived outlines in mind and will categorized their ideas into such structures. Their strong suit is being able to share clear ideas easily. "They do not take the effect of their writing on the audience into consideration. They need help to revise their structures and relate their information to [[Learn from your past experiences|personal experience]] or that of the audience."

*Feeling* types need to feel a personal connection to the topic of their writing, trying to convey a certain sentiment/feeling to the audience. This can come at the sacrifice of clarity of ideas and lack of structure. They should also be encouraged to provide examples to their ideas as well as other opposing perspectives.

### Judging vs perceiving mbti in writing

*Judging* types tend to write with haste with a narrow focus, putting an emphasis on achieving the writing objective rapidly in order to complete the task. This may leave them with less [[Inclination are personal preferences|inclination]] to do revisions and re-consider deviating from their initial outline. Providing them with explicit permission to 'wander free' maybe bemaybe

*Perceiving* types follow broad ideas and have difficulty narrowing down the scope. They will review a lot of information and try to use multiples approaches to knowledge (the article calls this an *epistemological approach*). "Writing will be thorough but often lack focus."

> [!NOTE] Definition of Epistemology
> It means theory of knowledge and is a branch of philosophy. How should one approach knowledge and confirm understanding?
