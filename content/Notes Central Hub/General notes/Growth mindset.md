> A growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can be developed through effort, perseverance, and learning. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which believes that traits and abilities are innate and unchangeable. With a growth mindset, individuals embrace challenges, see failures as opportunities for growth, and are inspired by the success of others. They understand that skills and abilities can be improved with dedication and hard work.

Growth mindset is the antithesis of [[Learned helplessness is giving up after repeated failures|learned helplessness]]. It's believing that we can grow our abilities through dedication and hard work such as [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate effort]], [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]].

It also means we need to invest in our education as well as lifelong learning, according to the [[Seven habits scale to evaluate well-being|Seven habits scale to evaluate well-being]]. That's why [[Humans are motivated to grow|learning new things is so important to our self-esteem]] and sense of [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]] .

Once we know that something is possible, we can convert this [[Transform information into knowledge|information into knowledge]] and apply it within our own lives. It's a process of [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|learning quickly]].

One needs to believe in their [[Self-perception refers to the way individuals perceive and interpret themselves|self-efficacy]] and have [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-esteem]].

## Four-minute mile shows that we can achieve what others have done

For a long time, people believed that running a mile under 4 minutes was impossible. The thought was that it would require extraordinary conditions and would not be broken unless stars align.

However, this was achieved by "Roger Bannister, who, on May 6, 1954, busted through the four-minute barrier with a time of **three minutes, fifty-nine and four-tenths** of a second."^[https://hbr.org/2018/03/what-breaking-the-4-minute-mile-taught-us-about-the-limits-of-conventional-thinking].

## Knowledges allow us to adopt new perspectives

Once people saw what was possible, they started [[Bayesian Decision Theory|changing their beliefs]] on what was possible and imagining the possibilities, allowing them to [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|get a new perspective]]. Their [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] were beginning to change and integrate this [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|new information]]. Someone else demonstrated that it can be done.

Therefore, [[Great artists steal|if you can replicate it]],, there's no particular reason why it be would outside the realm of human possibilities. We have to [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|push ourselves to the limits to see what is possible]].
