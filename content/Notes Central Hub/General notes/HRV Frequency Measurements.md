## Definition of heart rate variability

Also known initialized as HRV.

> Heart rate variability is where the **amount of time between your heartbeats fluctuates slightly**. Even though these fluctuations are undetectable except with specialized devices, they can still indicate current or future health problems, including heart conditions and mental health issues like anxiety and depression.^[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21773-heart-rate-variability-hrv]

> Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is a term that describes many metrics and analysis techniques, including Time Domain, Frequency Domain, and Non-Linear Analysis.^[https://help.elitehrv.com/article/159-hrv-frequency#:~:text=Low%2DFrequency%20power%20(LF)%3A,Balance%2C%20but%20that%20is%20controversial.]

## Common frequency domain hrv metrics

> -   High-Frequency power (HF): frequency activity in the 0.15 - 0.40Hz range (green in the above chart)
> -   Low-Frequency power (LF): frequency activity in the 0.04 - 0.15Hz range (yellow in the above chart)
> -   LF/HF Ratio: A **ratio of Low Frequency to High Frequency**.
> 	- Some consider this indicative of Sympathetic to Parasympathetic Autonomic Balance, but that is controversial.^[https://help.elitehrv.com/article/159-hrv-frequency#:~:text=Low%2DFrequency%20power%20(LF)%3A,Balance%2C%20but%20that%20is%20controversial.]
