# Preventing cognitive bias using cognitive forcing strategies

#status/done

Related to [[Brains are biased by nature]]

As we know, recognizing these biases is the first step to overcoming them. But there are other small strategies we can follow in order to train our unconscious mind to think in different ways.

From [[Improving our memory|strengthening our memory]] and [[Remove distractions through minimalism|minimizing distractions]], to slowing down our decision-making and improving our reasoning skills, we can work towards overcoming these cognitive biases.

Many of the strategies used to avoid bias that we describe are also known as **cognitive forcing strategies**, which are mental tools used to force unbiased *decision-making*.

## What are cognitive-forcing strategies which help reduce bias?

> [!ai]+ AI

> Cognitive-forcing strategies are techniques or approaches aimed at reducing bias in thinking and decision-making processes. Here are some examples:
> 1. Awareness and [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]]: Being aware of one's biases is the first step towards reducing their impact. Mindfulness exercises and self-reflection such as [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] can help individuals become more conscious of their own biases.
> 2. Seek diverse perspectives: Actively seeking out diverse viewpoints and perspectives can help challenge one's own biases. This could involve engaging in discussions with people from different backgrounds, reading diverse literature, or exposing oneself to a variety of opinions.
> 3. Question assumptions: [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|Regularly questioning one's assumptions and beliefs]] can help uncover hidden biases. This involves critically evaluating information and considering alternative explanations or interpretations.
> 4. Use decision matrices: Decision matrices provide a structured approach to decision-making by weighing different factors against each other. This helps reduce bias by introducing a systematic evaluation process.
> 5. Devil's advocate: Assigning someone the role of a devil's advocate can facilitate critical thinking and challenge biased viewpoints. This person purposely takes an opposing position to encourage open discussion and exploration of alternative perspectives.
> 6. Slow down thinking: [[Being patient leads to better decisions|Taking time to deliberate before making decisions]] can reduce biases influenced by cognitive shortcuts or automatic thinking. Slowing down allows for more careful consideration of evidence and reduces the reliance on biases.
> 7. Bias training and education: Providing individuals with training on bias identification and mitigation techniques can increase awareness and equip them with skills to counteract biases effectively.
> 8. Use [[Data-driven decision-making|Data-driven decision-making]]: Relying on data, statistics, and evidence-based approaches instead of intuition or personal beliefs can help reduce bias in [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|decision-making]] processes.
> 9. Implement checks and balances: Establishing systems that include multiple stakeholders or review processes can help identify and mitigate biases. This could involve peer reviews, independent audits, or diverse evaluation panels.
> 10. Encourage diversity in teams: Building diverse teams that include individuals with various backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives can help promote a collective decision-making process that challenges biases.
> It's essential to note that while cognitive-forcing strategies can help reduce bias, complete elimination of bias may not be possible.
>
> However, these strategies can provide individuals and organizations with tools to recognize and address biases, leading to more informed and fair decision-making processes.

For example, humans are prone to the [[Fundamental attribution error|fundamental attribution error]] and we may not seek alternative perspectives or alternate explanations before assigning blame.
