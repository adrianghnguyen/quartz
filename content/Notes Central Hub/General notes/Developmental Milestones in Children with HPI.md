# Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI

#status/done

---

Most gifted children will go through child developmental stages that are more *peculiar* and hit developmental milestones earlier than their peers.^[Neubeauer & Fink, 2009; Vaire-Douret 2011] At this time, there are no discovered biological markers which can be observed to determine if a child has [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]].

In general, HPI children tend to hit developmental milestones earlier than their peers, following each other in closer succession.

HPI Age | Developmental milestone
-- |--
~9 months | First spoken words
9-11 months | First steps
11-13 months | Unassisted walking
18 months | First complete sentences - developed the ability to create word associations
2 years | Tend to be able to understand complex and complete sentences, understanding abstract thought
3 years | Recognizing numbers and letter, being able to begin reading and writing in a limited capacity

## Age comparison of motor skills development between the norm and HPI

Most are already able to express themselves like adults in complete and accurate vocabulary with excellent pronunciation. Adults around the child may notice their advanced speech for their particular age. They may also possess relatively advanced motor skills, able to balance, control their movement.

Some will become skilled in hand-eye coordination. However, the majority will tend to underinvest in that sphere of development

## Giftedness is correlated with inherited parental genetics

Giftedness seems to be correlated with inherited genetics based on evidence of IQ test scores.  During early childhood, IQ test scores are mainly dependent on [[Personality is shaped our environment|environmental factors]] and upbringing but stabilize over time.

> 80% of [[IQ test]] results can be correlated to inherited genetics when correlated to tests obtained during adulthood.^[Bouchard, T. J. (2013). The Wilson effect: the increase in heritability of IQ with age. _Twin Research and Human Genetics_, _16_(5), 923-930.] In other words, as you get older, you tend to resemble your parent's IQ  intelligence scores.

> [!NOTE] False myths about IQ
> Long story short, we only tend to match our parents' IQ scores towards adulthood.

> - The first is that IQ is significantly heritable beginning at least at age 7.
> - The second is that by age 10 genetic variance is larger than shared environmental variance.
> - Third, the heritability increases with age until late adulthood when it reaches the mid-seventies and higher for some populations.
> Contrary to the widespread belief that ‘the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune’ accumulate over time (a version of the spun glass theory of mind);^[ Schofield, W. (1986). Psychotherapy: The purchase of friendship. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books.Google Scholar] the brain appears to be a robust and resilient mechanism.^[Bouchard, T. J. (2013). The Wilson effect: the increase in heritability of IQ with age. Twin Research and Human Genetics, 16(5), 923-930.]

## The challenging needs of babies with high intellectual potential

The needs of babies with [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]] can be quite demanding for new parents. Often times, they can seem to be babies with high needs^[In English, we typically refer to **babies with high needs** as fussy babies. In French, we use the term *BABI* - *"bébés aux besoins intenses"*.]

However, it's important to note that this is not an actually recognized medical term with podiatrists. They prefer using the term *babies with difficult temperament* which represents about **10% of the newly born population**. Based on observations, babies marked for HPI fall under this category.

Some noticeable traits and needs:

- [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children]]
- High reactivity to environment and subsequent changes (light, noise, clothing, parental emotions) relationship to [[Mental Noise Hypothesis|mental noise hypothesis]]?

As a result, they need a lot of attention and energy from the parents - often needing to be held, with quick parental responses. They often develop strong needs of attachment to their parents - earlier who run the risk of of **being tired, feeling guilty, frustrated and irritable in regards to their parental skills.**

In the early days, they tend to have the following behaviors which are reflected in a higher intensity which tapers with time thanks to [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]] and adjusted parental needs.

- Form strong sense of attachments,
- Be lively
- Have strong observational skills
- Strong feelings of joy and wonder

### Gifted children tend to have difficulty with sleep

Sleep is generally important throughout all of a child's development as it helps with [[Memory is processed information|memory]] consolidation.

On the other hand, HPI children tend to have trouble with sleep, and having more sleep disorders than the norm. They tend to sleep about 7**-10 hours of sleep a night** versus the standard of 9-12 hours in regular children. In short, they sleep less.^[p.108 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

#### Hypothesis of more efficient cognitive functioning in gifted children

One leading hypothesis is that gifted children spend a longer proportion of their sleep in the REM sleep cycle,^[Vaivre-Douret, L. (2011). Developmental and cognitive characteristics of “high-level potentialities”(highly gifted) children. _International journal of pediatrics_, _2011_.] which is associated with memory consolidation, organization, [[Neuroplasticity]], and creativity ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]]).
