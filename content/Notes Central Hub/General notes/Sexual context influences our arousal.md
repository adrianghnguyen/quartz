Context in sexual arousal is our attitude and mood towards sex. How you feel in the moment influences how [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexually aroused]] or turned on you would be. Put simply, your external circumstances and your internal brain state (these are our [[Perception aka Mood|perceptions]]) can influence your [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sexual responsiveness (SES)]]

Sexual context is defined as the following:

- Circumstances of the present moment (who you're with, novelty of the situation, safety of the context)
- Current state of mind/brain state (state of relaxation, stress levels, feeling loved, feelings of [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]])

## Differences between sexes in regards to sexual arousal

Here are the findings from [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]:

- Women tend to be more sexually sensitive to these factors (mood, relationship factors) informing context in comparison to men
- The variability of [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]] within women is also more pronounced within the group itself
	- i.e. how much these factors will have an effect on the woman

One interesting marital tip is that replicating external circumstances but failing to take into account context might not replicate sexual arousal. For example, making love as parents is different than the two single adults who just got into a relationship.
