Test Operate Test Exit explains how humans approach problem-solving as an [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative approach]] until the goal is achieved.

A [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|problem-solving model]] which explains how we carry out goals via [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative approach]]until we achieve the desired end state. The organism or subject has a goal, which they seek to resolve because there's a gap so they perform an action (or operation).

If this the goal is achieved, good move on. Otherwise, we repeat the process.

> TOTE (test, operate, test, exit). In the TOTE sequence a goal is first planned, and a test is performed to determine whether the goal has been accomplished. If it has not been accomplished, operations are performed to achieve the goal. The test is performed again, and exit occurs if the goal is achieved. Otherwise, the process repeats.

> TOTE had a significant impact on psychology, because it provided a realistic model of how humans pursue goals and carry out plans. Miller’s work encouraged researchers to abandon the more constricted, behaviorally oriented approach based on stimulus-response. The TOTE unit also served as the basis for many later theories of [problem solving](https://www.britannica.com/science/problem-solving).^[https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-A-Miller]

TOTE is a successor theory to Stimulus Response Theory which seeks to explain [[Priming effects|priming effects]].

## Alternative theories to the TOTE model

### Stimulus response theory

Stimulus Response Theory was proposed by Edward Thorndike, who believed that learning boils down to two things: stimulus, and response. Think Pavlov's dog. It seeks to explain how human behavior is a result of the interaction between stimuli and responses. It is a preceding theory from which the TOTE model evolved.

### Successor theories to test operate test exit

Since the development of the TOTE model, several successor theories have been proposed that build on its basic framework. Some of these successor theories include:

- Cybernetic models: These models, which were developed in the 1960s and 1970s, build on the TOTE model by incorporating concepts from cybernetics, which is the study of control systems. Cybernetic models suggest that behavior is guided by a set of [[Feedback loop|feedback loops]] that help people to adjust their actions based on changes in the environment.
- [[Control Systems Theory|Control Theory]]: This theory, which was first proposed in the 1980s, suggests that people engage in a process of goal-setting and goal-striving. According to control theory, people constantly monitor their progress towards their goals and adjust their behavior as necessary to achieve those goals.
- [[Dynamic systems theory|Dynamic systems theory]]: This theory, which emerged in the 1990s, suggests that behavior is not necessarily guided by a set of fixed rules or [[Feedback loop|feedback loops]], but rather emerges from the interactions between a person and their environment. Dynamic systems theory emphasizes the importance of understanding the complex, nonlinear relationships between different factors that influence behavior.

These successor theories to the TOTE model have helped to deepen our understanding of how people engage in goal-directed behavior and adapt to changes in their environment.
