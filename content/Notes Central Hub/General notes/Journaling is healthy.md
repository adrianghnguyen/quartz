# Journaling is healthy and helps us manage stress

> [!Quote] Ocean Vuong on writing

Journaling is the act of writing down intrusive thoughts, feelings and insights on paper. It often helps me [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|understand my own thoughts more clearly through introspection]].

## Why everyone wishes to be a writer according to the School of Life

[Why so Many People Want to Be Writers - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axXn_Vn2vYo)

> The video delves into the prevalent contemporary ambition of becoming a writer, attributing it to factors such as widespread literacy and the transformative potential of literature. However, it also suggests that this desire may be rooted in feelings of isolation and loneliness, with writing serving as a means to express emotions and thoughts when other forms of communication fail to offer attentive response. The video contrasts this inclination towards writing with Socrates' viewpoint, highlighting that writing could be a substitute for genuine human interaction, indicating a breakdown of meaningful interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, the video emphasizes the importance of addressing emotional needs and fostering authentic connections in a world where writing can be both an artistic outlet and a response to unmet social and emotional yearnings.
