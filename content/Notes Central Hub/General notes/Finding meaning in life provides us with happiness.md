# Finding meaning in life provides happiness

Related to [[Module 6 Building Your Future]]

[[Asking for the meaning of life is a fundamental question of the human condition|Asking and seeking for the meaning of life is common human nature.]] It can also be measured through the [[Meaning in life questionnaire|Meaning in life questionnaire]].

I feel like a lot of these questions come hand in hand when you experience [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] in some form as it becomes salient. According to [[Tran Huynh|my mom]], this is a question I had asked at a [[Personal reflections on my childhood|very early age]] when I was about 5 years old.

## The three ingredients in the meaning of life

The meaning of life can be found in 3 parts by [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|breaking things down into smaller parts]] according to the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|Harvard course on happiness]]:

## The different aspects of finding purpose and fulfillment in the meaning of life

> In the context of the meaning of life, the concepts of "presence" and "search" represent different approaches to finding purpose and fulfillment.
>
> "Presence" refers to being fully engaged and mindful in the current moment, finding meaning and contentment in what you are experiencing right now. It's about appreciating the present for what it is and finding joy in the little moments that make up your daily life.
>
> On the other hand, "search" involves actively seeking out a deeper purpose or understanding of life. It's the quest to discover your unique role, significance, or a grander meaning that might extend beyond immediate experiences. This often involves exploring different paths, ideas, and philosophies to uncover a sense of meaning that resonates with you.
>
> In simpler terms, "presence" is about finding happiness in the here and now, while "search" is about looking for a greater sense of purpose or fulfillment that might require exploring various avenues. Both approaches have their merits – finding presence can lead to contentment in everyday moments, while the search can lead to a more profound sense of meaning that guides your life's direction.

We can evaluate our propensity to seek these items in our lives through the [[Meaning in life questionnaire|Meaning in life questionnaire]].

Apparently it's important to separate the difference between finding meaning in life from finding the meaning of life. I'm not exactly sure what it means.

## Pursue eudaimonia to live life with purpose and meaning

> **Epictetus** (c. 50–c. 135 AD) was one of the most prominent Stoic philosophers, who believed happiness comes from finding life’s purpose, accepting one’s fate, and behaving morally regardless of the personal cost. His philosophy could be summarized as “happiness is earned by doing your duty.”
>
> Epicurus emphasized the concept of **hedonia** while Epictetus emphasized **eudaimonia**. In simplest terms, hedonia is related to pleasure and eudaimonia is related to meaning. In modern culture we tend to think of hedonia as the drive to feel good and eudaimonia as the drive to feel purpose. Both Greek words, hedonia and eudaimonia, were concepts of pleasure and meaning in service to what the Greeks debated most—the life worth living.
