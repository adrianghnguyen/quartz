There's something to be said about the advantages of open-source philosophy. [[2023-11-15|Recently]], my [[Personal financial management|budgeting app]] just got shut down, and it means that I need transfer and migrate my data which isn't exactly fun. 

Going with some open-source stuff from things I need long-term might be a better choice moving forward. It means it's permanently mine, and as long as I have the default executable, I can always run it and won't be impacted by downstream changes. I think it's important for things which I will need for the long-term.

## Core principles open-source

| Principle     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transparency  | Open-source promotes transparency by allowing users to access and review the source code of a software project. This enables developers to identify and fix bugs, improve security, and ensure the software aligns with their values.                                                                    |
| Collaboration | Open-source fosters collaboration by enabling developers from different backgrounds and locations to work together on a project. By sharing knowledge, skills, and resources, these developers can create higher-quality software that better meets the needs of users.                                  |
| Flexibility   | Open-source provides flexibility by allowing users to modify and customize the source code of a project to suit their specific requirements. This can lead to faster innovation, greater efficiency, and increased competitiveness in the marketplace.                                                   |
| Community     | Open-source builds strong communities around projects by creating opportunities for users to contribute feedback, suggestions, bug reports, and code improvements. These communities often become passionate advocates for the projects they support and help drive their success over time.             |
| Access        | Open-source expands access to technology by making it freely available for anyone to use or modify without needing to pay licensing fees or comply with restrictive terms of use. This helps level the playing field for smaller organizations that may not have large budgets for software development. |
