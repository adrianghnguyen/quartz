## What is transit-oriented development?

> [!NOTE] Developing a more sustainable future
> _“TOD is a process of reconnecting transportation and land use which helps future development of today’s cities necessitates an outlook of sustainability as well as the integrated management of currently available resources” (Sohoni, Thomas and Rao, 2016, p. 3221)_

> In [[urban planning]], transit-oriented development (TOD) is a type of urban development that maximizes the amount of residential, business and leisure space within walking distance of public transport. It promotes a symbiotic relationship between dense, compact urban form and public transport use. In doing so, TOD aims to increase public transport ridership by reducing the use of private cars and by promoting sustainable urban growth.
>
> TOD typically includes a central transit stop (such as a train station, or light rail or bus stop) surrounded by a high-density mixed-use area, with lower-density areas spreading out from this center. TOD is also typically designed to be more walkable than other built-up areas, by using smaller block sizes and reducing the land area dedicated to automobiles. The densest areas of TOD are normally located within a radius of 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 mile (400 to 800 m) around the central transit stop, as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians, thus solving the last mile problem.

Cities are often leaving money on the table by not factoring how they're going to use their transit systems as an economic resource. [[REF Exploring the Transit-oriented Development Level of HK|Hong Kong transit]] is one of the shining examples of the effectiveness of this system by buying up the surrounding land and allowing commercial activity to participate on these grounds, allowing the city to have a predictable tax revenue source.
