# Stress response system and its lifecycle

## Stress response cycle in a nutshell

There are three main stages in the stress response cycle

> 1. Beginning (“I’m at risk!”)
> 2. Middle (action)
> 3. End (“I’m safe!”)
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

## The main stages of the stress response cycles

The stress response cycle involves several stages, including:

1. Perception of threat: The first stage of the stress response cycle is the perception of a threat or danger, whether real or perceived. This could be anything from a physical threat, such as being in a dangerous situation, to a psychological threat, such as [[Too many feelings lead to emotional overload|feeling overwhelmed]] by a task or situation.
2. Activation of the [[Sympathetic Nervous System|sympathetic nervous system]]: Once a threat is perceived, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to the release of hormones such as adrenaline and [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]]. This results in physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, rapid breathing, and sweating, which prepare the body for action.
3. [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|Fight-Flight-Freeze Response]]: In response to the perceived threat, the body prepares to either fight or flee the danger. This is known as the "[[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|fight or flight]]" response, and it involves a surge of energy and increased alertness.
4. Deactivation of the stress response: Once the threat has passed or the danger has been avoided, the parasympathetic nervous system is activated, leading to a decrease in the release of stress hormones and a return to a more relaxed state.

It is important to note that the stress response cycle can also become [[Types of stress|chronic]] if an individual is exposed to ongoing stressors, which can have negative effects on physical and mental health. Therefore, it is important to find healthy ways to manage and reduce stress by [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|completing the stress response cycle]].

## What is self-paced termination in stress?

Self-paced termination in stress refers to an individual's ability to regulate their own stress response and end a stressful situation when they feel they have had enough. It involves recognizing the symptoms of stress and taking steps to manage them, such as [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|practicing relaxation techniques]] or removing oneself from the stressful environment. This approach can be effective in preventing [[Types of stress|chronic stress]] and its negative effects on physical and mental health.^[Kozlowska, K., Walker, P., McLean, L., & Carrive, P. (2015). Fear and the defense cascade: clinical implications and management. Harvard review of psychiatry.]

## Why do we feel stress?

It's an evolutionary adaptive mechanism which allows us to perceive threats both in social settings through [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feelings]]. Even though we've evolved past our primordial stressors (to be replaced with [[Invisible lions of stress|modern stressors]]), our bodies are unable to tell the physiological difference.

This has implication for our sex lives, especially responses to [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual arousal]]. Stress is a core [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|SIS]] mechanism.
