The nervous system has two main components:
1. [[Central nervous system]] which is part of the brain and spinal cord
2. [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system]], which is made up of nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and extend to all parts of the body.

The role of the nervous system is to transmit signals between the brain and the rest of the body, including internal organs. The nervous systems of activity controls are ability to move, breathe, see, think, and more.^[MedlinePlus. (2016). Neurosciences. Retrieved June 16, 2017, from <https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007456.htm>] It would play a key role in [[Perception aka Mood|perception]] as well as the [[Mind-body connection|mind-body]] since it is the messenger of brain signals.

The brain itself is composed of a [[Neuroplasticity|network]] of neurons and glial cells.
