# Use the law of remarkability

## Law of remarkability

A simple law introduced in [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]] which can help me [[Learn new skills through projects|identify successful projects]] for making my [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]] ([[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission]]) a reality. It should be used with the [[Use little bets to test for breakthrough ideas|little-bets strategy]].

> The law says that for a mission-driven project to succeed, it should be “remarkable” in two different ways.
> 1. Itt must compel people who encounter it to remark about it to others.
> 2. It must be launched in a venue that supports such remarking.

For example, [Nikita](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) who has an extensive digital garden ([[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains]]) made a tool which allows us to easily look up all of his posted information via Alfred - a tool that allows us to look up his brain - a form of heuristic ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]]).

## Personal reflections

Not everything needs to be a showstopper and it should be selected because it feels right to you ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]]). If you feel like it has meaning, I think that's good enough.

However, if you wish to turn it into something outside, that requires a certain attachment to the world, you'll need to open yourself to feedback ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]), work in public ([[Share your journey publicly]]) and realize that you're in the for long haul ([[Success requires time and patience]]).
