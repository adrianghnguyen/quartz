# Writing is the medium by which we think more clearly and trace out our thoughts

#status/done

[[Richard Feynman]] is the one who explained how thinking is how we 'prove our thinking' if I had to remember what Mr. Blakely, my high school science teacher also taught us. It's very powerful to allow us to perform [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]].

It's why there are multiple psychological theories explaining why [[Writing to learn|writing is the key to us generating knowledge]]:
1. Writing inherently causes us to produce knowledge, as explained by the point of utterance hypothesis
2. By writing, and allowing us to re-read them, we develop new contexts to apply the information into knowledge and bring it to our memories ([[Information processing theory]])
3. When writing, we use [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]]  to understand concepts. An example would be using [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handles]] in order to encapsulate difficult ideasâ€¦such as thinking-writing! It's like a nickname to simplify things.
4. We work from a certain end hypothesis and we build up the facts/knowledge up to the hypothesis along the way similarly to [[Work backwards from the conclusion|working backward from the conclusion]]

[[Journaling is healthy|Journaling is healthy and helps provides introspection into complicated thoughts.]]
