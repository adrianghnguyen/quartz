Stress has a negative  impact on our [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual response]].

The role of hormones and neurochemicals released during the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] is not fully understood at this time but we do know some things about how it impacts [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual arousal]]. [[Stress is about ensuring organism survival|Stress is about ensuring survival]] of the organism. Sex has many purposes but personal survival is typically not included unless it's about attachment.

For most people, stress activates the [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|stress sex brakes]] except for about 10-20% of the population ^[ [[Come as you are by Emily Nagoski]]] as a result of [[Homology aka same parts organized differently|each individuals having the same organs but organized differently]].

Even for that small subset of the population, stress reduces sexual pleasure by inhibiting the [[Brain reward or enjoyment system releases dopamine|enjoying process of dopamine release]] even if it increases [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sexual interest (sexual eagerness)]]. This is a [[Outcomes derive from a complex system of interactions|complex system of interactions]] which is mediated by the [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one Emotional Ring which governs various emotional processes]].

As a result, if we want to have more interest in sex and derive more pleasure, we need to manage our stress levels - easier said than done.

## Many women's sex lives are impacted by stress

## Broken cultural messages create stress in sex

In order to manage stress effectively, we need to complete the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response cycle]]. As humans, most of our [[Difference between Stressors and Stress|stressors]]  are [[Invisible lions of stress|invisible lions]].

1. When we fail to address our chronic stressors (see more at [[Types of stress]]), it builds up inside of us leading to overall reduced pleasure, enjoyment which also extends to sex (see [[Dual control model of sexual response|dual control model of sexual response]]).
2. Our [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|cultural message]] is to ignore our feelings (which are useful see [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges]]).  Most people choose to ignore the stressor completely or to try and relax.
3. Human brains are good at self-inhibition in terms of stopping our [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] midway as it is not appropriate to deal with it now. This is in order to maintain our social cooperation (don't freak out other people).

Unfortunately, stress management is not like turning on and off a light switch. We've been raised in an [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|emotionally-dismissive]] [[Cultural roots of shame|culture of shame]].

# Attachment distress-fueled sex

One common way that stress impacts [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]] is through attachment distress-fueled sex.

This type of sex is driven by a [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|need for emotional connection]] and validation *rather than physical pleasure*. Individuals who engage in attachment distress-fueled sex may feel disconnected from their partner or themselves, and are seeking comfort and reassurance through sexual activity leading to things like sexual [[Infidelity]] %%like in the case with [[Melodie Zhou]] %%. Might be worth reading Mating in Captivity by Esther Perel to better understand infidelity someday.

Attachment distress-fueled sex can be problematic because it often leads to unsatisfying experiences for both partners. Individuals may feel [[Shame and guilt are inherited|guilty or ashamed]] or  after engaging in this type of sex, which can further exacerbate [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|feelings of stress]] and [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]]. It can be a form of [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behavior]] and is may be a coping response to [[Trauma|trauma].

To combat the negative effects of stress on sexual response, individuals should prioritize self-care activities such as exercise, meditation, or therapy. It is also important for couples to communicate openly about their needs and desires in the bedroom to avoid engaging in attachment distress-fueled sex. By taking proactive steps to manage stress and prioritize emotional connection during sexual activity, individuals can experience more fulfilling and satisfying experiences in the bedroom.
