Here is the garden metaphor which explains how shame is implanted into our [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal gardens]].

> Let’s return to the garden metaphor: You’re born with a little plot of rich and fertile soil, unique to yourself.
>
> Your brain and body are the soil of this garden, and individual differences in your [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|SIS]] and [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|SES]] are important characteristics of your innate garden, which is made of the same parts as everyone else’s, but organized in a unique way.
>
> Your family and your culture plant the seeds and tend the garden, and they teach you how to tend it. They plant the seeds of language and attitudes and knowledge and habits about love and safety and bodies and sex.
>
> And gradually, as you move into adolescence, you take on responsibility for tending your own garden. As you begin to tend the garden yourself, you may find that your family and your culture have planted some beautiful, nourishing things. You may also find that your family and culture have planted some pretty toxic crap in your garden.
>
> And everyone—even those whose families planted pretty good stuff—will have to deal with the invasive weeds of a sex-negative culture full of body shaming and sex stigma. These travel not in the seeds planted by families but underground via their roots, like poison ivy, under fences and over walls, from garden to garden. No one chose that they be there, but there they are nonetheless.
>
> So if you want to have a healthy garden, a garden you choose, you have to go row by row and figure out what you want to keep and nurture . . . and what you want to dig out and replace with something healthier.
