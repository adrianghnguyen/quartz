# Hypersensitivity in gifted children

#status/done

Related to [[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI]]

Gifted children have been demonstrated to have alternate information processing pathways to their brains. A large number of them would tend to be hypersensitive - having stronger than the norm's reaction to **sensory** or **emotional experiences**. This would include things like lights, hunger, heat, cold, pain, etc.^[Melnick et al., 2013]

Conversely, they may be hyposensitive - below normal responses. I guess the sensitivity paths are outside the standard deviations.

## Gifted children tend to possess emotional hypersensitivity and high levels of empathy

![[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children.png]]

Gifted children tend to be high in emotional reactivity. It would stand that they may have stronger [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|reactions to emotional harm]] as well as stronger [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behaviors]] if they experience things like [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|traumatic events]].

This may manifest itself as an explosive character, an intense personality at least within the household. To mask this trait, some may even develop a Dr Jekyll and Hyde syndrome - especially within gifted girls.

Gifted children tend to possess high levels of [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|empathy]] - of which there are two types:

- **emotional** empathy (capacity to feel emotions and sensations of others while relating it to one's self)
- **cognitive** empathy (ability to place one's self in another's shoe, understand another's mental state)

As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to other people's hurts as well as having stronger reactions to perceived injustice.^[Matthews et al., 2018; Schechtman & Silektor, 2012]

Oh hey - that's me.

This type of heightened emotional response may be a double-edge sword when we consider [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|twice exceptionalism]].

## Possible relationship between hypersensitivity and trauma

My theory is that since all experiences can be amplified as a result of hypersensitivity possible to an overly active amygdala, would it be a reasonable assumption that [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] would have a greater impact since it's mainly memories recorded as somatosensory response?

Look into [[Brain-Body Disconnect During Trauma]].
