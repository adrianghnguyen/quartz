# Our unconscious defaults to prospecting the future

#status/done

Related to [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems]]

The unconscious brain has something called a default circuit - which occurs when we try not to think about anything. According to research, our default circuit focuses a lot on the future when it is idle.

> Humans spend an average of between 30% and 50% of their time *daydreaming by the future, which we call prospection* (link to [[Prospect Theory explains human irrationality and heuristics for loss minimization|prospect theory]]?). For people who are go-getters, this may be more. (sounds a lot like [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] to me).

> The default circuit is like a [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|monkey in our heads]] always jumping from tree to tree, looking for the next banana. We want a tree full of bananas and a way to get them.

The unique ability to prospect and project into the future is a uniquely human ability. Our brains are wired to think about the future constantly, so we might be prone to [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] if there's an over adaptation.

## Homo prospectus concept explains how humans are forward-thinking beings

> Homo prospectus is a term coined by psychologist Martin Seligman to describe humans as forward-thinking beings. It suggests that our ability to imagine and anticipate future events plays a crucial role in our decision-making and overall well-being. Unlike other animals, humans have the unique ability to mentally simulate various scenarios and weigh the potential outcomes before making choices. This concept highlights the importance of our future-oriented thinking and its impact on our motivation, goal-setting, and resilience. Overall, homo prospectus emphasizes our capacity to imagine and shape our futures.

## Humans dwell in the past and future, according to the Buddha

> People do not generally live in their actions, in the present moment. They live in the past or in the future. Though they seem to be doing something now, here, they live somewhere else in their thoughts, in their imaginary problems and worries, usually in the memories of the past or in desires and speculations about the future. Therefore, they do not live in, nor do they enjoy, what they do at the moment. So, they are unhappy and discontented with the present moment, with the work at hand, and naturally, they cannot give themselves fully to what they appear to be doing.

> Sometimes, you see a man in a restaurant reading while eating—a very common sight. He gives you the impression of being a very busy man, with no time even for eating. You wonder whether he eats or reads. One may say that he does both. In fact, he does neither, he enjoys neither. He is strained and disturbed in mind, and he does not enjoy what he does at the moment, does not live his life in the present moment, but unconsciously and foolishly tries to escape from life. (This does not mean, however, that one should not talk with a friend while having lunch or dinner.)
>
> You cannot escape life, however, you may try. As long as you live, whether in a town or in a cave, you have to face it and live it. Real life is the present moment—*not the memories of the past which are dead and gone, nor the dreams of the future which are not yet born. One who lives in the present moment lives the real life, and he is happiest.*
