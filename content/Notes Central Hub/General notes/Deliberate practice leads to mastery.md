# Mastery is acquiring rewarding skills through deliberate practice

> [!QUOTE] Ira Glass
> The key thing is to force yourself through the work, force the skills to come; that’s the **hardest** phase.

## What is deliberate practice?

The style of difficult practice required to continue to improve at a task. Deliberate practice requires you to **stretch past where you are comfortable** ([[View challenges as opportunities]]) and then receive ***[[Continuous feedback leads to change|continous feedback]]***  on your performance. In general, it takes [[The 10 000-hour rule|10,000 hours]] of deliberate practice in order to achieve mastery over a subject.

![[_Kindle_Highlights - So Good They Cant Ignore You - Newport, Cal#^ref-5858]]

Florida State University professor Anders Ericsson, who coined the term in the early 1990s, describes it formally as an **“activity designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively *improving specific aspects* of an individual’s performance.”**

> As hundreds of follow-up studies have since shown, deliberate practice provides the key to excellence in a diverse array of fields, among which are chess, medicine, auditing, computer programming, bridge, physics, sports, typing, juggling, dance, and music.^[Ericsson and Lehmann, “Expert and Exceptional Performance: Evidence of Maximal Adaptation to Task Constraints,” Annual Review of Psychology_ 47 (1996): 273–305.]

### Example of masters of deliberate practice

> **[[Cooking connects me to others]]:** Jiro Ono, the subject of the documentary [Jiro Dreams of Sushi](https://jamesclear.com/video/jiro-dreams-of-sushi), is a chef and owner of an award-winning sushi restaurant in Tokyo. Jiro has dedicated his life to perfecting the art of making sushi and he expects the same of his apprentices. Each apprentice must master one tiny part of the sushi-making process at a time—how to wring a towel, how to use a knife, how to cut the fish, and so on. One apprentice trained under Jiro for ten years before being allowed to cook the eggs. Each step of the process is taught with the utmost care.

> **Chess:** Magnus Carlsen is a chess grandmaster and one of the highest-rated players in history. One distinguishing feature of great chess players is their ability to recognize “chunks,” which are specific arrangements of pieces on the board. Some experts estimate that grandmasters can identify around 300,000 different chunks. Interestingly, Carlsen learned the game by playing computer chess, which allowed him to play multiple games at once. Not only did this strategy allow him to learn chunks much faster than someone playing in-person games, but also gave him a chance to **make more mistakes and correct his weaknesses at an accelerated pace.([[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster]])**

## Questions for deliberate practice

> From what I can tell, the experts who embrace the idea of deliberate practice continually ask themselves three questions…
>
> **1. Do I understand the fundamentals?** No matter how advanced they become, experts never lose sight of the [fundamentals](https://jamesclear.com/vince-lombardi-fundamentals). In many ways, they are advanced for that very reason: they understand the fundamentals better than anyone else.
>
> **2. Am I working on the next step?** There are a lot of smart people who know what the next step is, but never do it. Similarly, there are many people who take action, but waste time working on skills that don't build upon each other. [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|Experts build knowledge and skills that are cumulative]].
>
> **3. What am I missing?** One of the greatest pitfalls of the 10,000 Hour Rule is that it makes expertise seems like a finish line that can be crossed. It can't. Expertise is not a race that can be won. It is simply a process that can be embraced. Experts are constantly asking themselves, “What am I missing? What new information is out there? What can I learn? How can I grow?”

### Applying deliberate practice towards career development

In the context of career construction, most knowledge workers avoid this style of [[Active practice leads to skill development|skill development]] because, quite frankly, it’s [[View challenges as opportunities|uncomfortable]]. It also takes a long time and requires [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|perseverance]] as explained by [[Grit by Angela Duckworth|Grit by Angela Duckworth]].

To build up large stores of [[Career capital|career capital]], which is necessary for [[Traits defining great work|creating work you love]], this style of practice should become a regular part of your work routine which is why [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits|daily rituals are so important]].

## The neuroscience behind deliberate practice and its impact on brain growth

> [!quote] How brains change with new skills
> Specifically, training resulted in decreased activity in brain regions involved in effortful control and attention that closely overlap with the frontoparietal control and dorsal attention networks.
>
> Increased activity was found after training, however, in the default network that is involved in self-reflective activities, including future planning or even day dreaming. Thus, skill mastery is associated with increased activity in areas not engaged in skill performance, and this shift can be detected in the large-scale networks of the brain.

## Grind out the hard work

> ## A Volume of Work

> Now we have reached the stage where figuring out what to focus on becomes a real possibility.
> 
> You have experimented with enough ideas to discover one or two options that seem to provide better than average results for you. You've overcome the hurdle of wanting more information and the fear of committing to something and now you've made a choice. You took the job. You started the business. You signed up for the class. You're ready.
> 
> Welcome to the grind. It's time to put in a volume of work. Not just once or twice. Not just when it's easy. But a consistent, repeated volume of work. You have to [fall in love with boredom](https://jamesclear.com/in-love-with-boredom) and [stay on the bus](https://jamesclear.com/stay-on-the-bus).

> It is through this sheer number of repetitions that you'll come to understand the fundamentals of your task. You might know what greatness looks like before this point, but you won't understand how to achieve greatness until you've put the work in yourself.
> 
> In the [words of Ira Glass](https://jamesclear.com/ira-glass-failure), “*your taste is good enough that you can tell that what you’re making is kind of a disappointment to you.*” You'll bridge that gap between what you know is good and what you can produce yourself by [putting in the reps](https://jamesclear.com/repetitions).

> **Want to dress well and develop killer style?** You’re going to have to try on a lot of clothes before you can simplify down to the essentials. You’ll probably have to buy a lot of clothes before you can really get a feel for what your day-in, day-out style is. I’m not a fan of promoting rampant consumerism, but if that’s the skill set you want to develop then it’s likely going to take some experimentation and effort.

> **Want to become a great cook?** How many bad meals do you think you need to make before you can whip up a “simple, but tasty dinner” whenever you feel like it? I’d say hundreds at least. I don’t know many people who are amazing cooks after making their tenth meal ever. Developing a deep understanding of the fundamentals of [[Cooking connects me to others]] takes a while.

> **Want to write an amazing book?** You're going to have to write and write and write some more. You need to write hundreds of thousands of words to find your voice, maybe millions. Then you need to edit those words and whittle them down to the most powerful version possible.

> Only after the repetitions have been completed will you understand which pieces of the task are fundamental to success.
