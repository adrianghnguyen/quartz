> [!NOTE] Brief note on the history of HPI
> The history of HPI research is still nascent, with most relevant research starting from the 1980s. There's been some setback in research within this field due to the uncomfortable nature of creating an unequal society if we started recognizing this concept. Most studies in the field are from 2005 and later. For example Iowa, United States, there was a new [research facility](https://belinblank.education.uiowa.edu/) focused on gifted kids, built around 2010.
>
> Do note that HPI is a different approach to development rather than a judgement on the societal value of a person. The end goal of this research is to recognize the needs of individuals and how we can better tailor needs for everyone - just like we do with things like autism spectrum disorder or mental health.
