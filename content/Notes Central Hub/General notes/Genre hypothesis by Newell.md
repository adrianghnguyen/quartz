[[Brains organize information into schemas|Brains organize and process information into schemas.]] They are used to help us understand patterns and create meaning from [[Transform information into knowledge|information into knowledge]].

> The genre hypothesis proposed by Newell in 1984 suggests that human cognition is highly dependent on our ability to recognize and make use of generic knowledge structures or "[[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]]" that represent common patterns of events, actions, and relationships within different domains. These [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]] allow us to rapidly and efficiently process new information by categorizing it into familiar patterns and making predictions about what is likely to happen next.

> According to Newell, these generic knowledge structures are not specific to any particular task or context, but rather are shared across a wide range of situations and are acquired through **experience and learning**. For example, we might have a generic schema for a "restaurant" that includes expectations about the types of food served, the layout of the dining area, and the roles of the waitstaff and customers.

> The genre hypothesis, proposed by Allen Newell, is a concept in cognitive psychology that suggests that the mind organizes information into categories or genres. These genres serve as mental frameworks that help individuals understand and process new information more efficiently. According to Newell, genres are formed based on common patterns and structures found in different domains or areas of knowledge. This hypothesis highlights the importance of categorization and the role it plays in cognitive processes such as perception, memory, and problem-solving.
