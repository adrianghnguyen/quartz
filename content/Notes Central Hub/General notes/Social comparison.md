Social comparison affects our [[Brain reward or enjoyment system releases dopamine|brain's reward system]] and can lead to decreased happiness. This process when we start wanting what others have which makes us lose perspective of the things we do currently possess and [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|our current blessings]].

## Humans engage in social comparison when there is unknown information

> We tend to compare when things are unknown, and cease comparing if firmer information is available.

So we imagine that the grass is greener because we lack first-hand knowledge of other people's circumstances. It's interesting because it's true - all individuals have their personal struggles but perhaps due to the theory of self-presentation, we only see their highlight reels (I am not fond of this phrase). 

I can relate to it myself - as I hear [[Personal stories of difficulties and setbacks|stories of personal struggles]] from my friends whom I idolized on a pedestal. Likewise, perhaps there are those who are envious of my position.

Why do humans engage in social comparison?

> [!ai]+ AI

> Humans engage in social comparison for several reasons:
> 1. Self-evaluation: Social comparison allows individuals to assess their own abilities, qualities, and achievements by comparing themselves to others. By examining how they measure up against others, people gain a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
> 2. Self-improvement: Social comparison can serve as a motivation to improve oneself. When individuals observe others who are more successful or accomplished in certain areas, it can inspire them to strive for similar achievements and work towards personal growth.
> 3. Identity formation: Comparing oneself to others helps in defining one's identity and sense of self. By identifying similarities or differences with others, individuals can develop a better understanding of who they are and what makes them unique.
> 4. Normative guidance: Social comparison provides a basis for evaluating social norms and expectations. By observing how others behave or conform to societal standards, people gain valuable information about what is considered acceptable or appropriate in a given context.
> 5. Emotional well-being: Comparing oneself to others can elicit various emotional responses. It can provide a sense of validation and boost self-esteem when individuals perceive themselves as superior to others. Alternatively, it can also lead to feelings of envy or inferiority when individuals perceive themselves as falling short in comparison.
> 6. Decision-making: Social comparison helps in making choices by providing reference points for judgment. By comparing options or alternatives based on how others have fared in similar situations, individuals can make more informed decisions.
> It is important to note that social comparison can have both positive and negative consequences. While it can motivate self-improvement and provide valuable insights, excessive or negative social comparison can lead to feelings of inadequacy, jealousy, or low self-worth.


> All judgments and evaluations are relative in nature and hence rely on comparisons. Social comparisons are involved in a wide range of social cognitive processes spanning from person perception to attitudes and stereotyping. The discovery of the neural correlates of social comparison would enable researchers to evaluate the role played by comparison in social cognitive processes and as a consequence to further elucidate the neural mechanisms of social cognition.

## Strategies to avoid social comparison

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> 1. Focus on your own achievements and progress: Instead of comparing yourself to others, concentrate on your own growth and accomplishments. Set personal goals and work towards them, celebrating your own successes.
> 2. Practice gratitude: Instead of feeling envious of what others have, focus on being grateful for what you have in your life. Take time each day to reflect on the positive aspects of your life and appreciate them.
> 3. Limit social media use: Social media platforms often showcase people's highlight reels, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and comparison. Limit your time spent on social media or take breaks from it altogether to avoid falling into the comparison trap.
> 4. Surround yourself with supportive people: Build a network of friends and family who support and encourage you rather than making you feel inferior. Surrounding yourself with positive influences can help boost your self-esteem and reduce social comparison tendencies.
> 5. Practice self-compassion: Be kind to yourself and embrace self-acceptance. Recognize that everyone has their own unique journey and struggles, and it's okay to have imperfections. Treat yourself with compassion and understanding.
> 6. Focus on collaboration rather than competition: Instead of viewing others as rivals, try to foster a sense of collaboration and cooperation. Recognize that everyone has different strengths and abilities, and working together can lead to better outcomes for all involved.
> 7. Engage in activities that promote self-esteem: Participate in activities that make you feel good about yourself, such as hobbies or volunteering. Engaging in activities that boost your self-esteem can help reduce the need for social comparison.
> 8. Seek professional help if needed: If you find that social comparison is significantly affecting your mental well-being or self-esteem, consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor who can help you develop strategies to cope with these feelings.
> Remember, social comparison is a natural part of human behavior, but it's important to recognize when it becomes detrimental to your mental health and take steps to mitigate its negative effects.
