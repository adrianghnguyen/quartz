Attachment and relationships are **about survival**.

When they are threatened, we will take actions in order to restore the connection with our attachment objects leading to anxious-driven behaviour as seen in [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment style]]. In the [[Baby Rhesus Monkey Experiment|monster-mother experiments]], we can also see how even other mammals experience this survival instinct when relationships are under [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|threats]].

When attachment and stress overlaps, we call these distressed relationships. From John Gottman's stories, we hear stories who had some of the best sex they've ever had after abusive relationships or acts of violence.

When the sense of [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|attachment]] is attacked or threatened, people in order to restore the connection, may engage in **attachment-driven sex**.

## Distressed relationships as a result of stress and attachment overlap

### People engage in solace sex to restore their connection of love

> I am lost. I feel lost.

When we feel [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|distress]], our [[We love through attachment behaviors|attachment object]] who was meant to be our *safe haven* becomes our source of distress - leading to **separation [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]]**. People in unstable [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|relationships]] may use **sex as an attachment behavior** to build or repair the sense of attachment.  One of the options is to do this through sex - aka *solace sex* in order to prove we are loved.^[Johnson, Hold Me Tight, 189.]

Hormones like [[dopamine]] and [[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|oxytocin]] are key players in the [[Eagerness System Aka General Emotional Gas Pedal|eagerness system]] leading to [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|approach behaviour]] even if unwanted. We might engage behaviors which would lead in said behaviours in order to repair a connection with distressing attachment object in order to re-establish this feeling of a safe haven.^[Dewitte, Marieke, “Different perspectives on the sex-attachment link.”]

> This is the dark side of pairing stress and attachment: the “I am lost” feeling, which motivates us to stabilize our connection with our attachment object—“I am home.” Therapist and author Sue Johnson calls this “solace sex,” sex that’s motivated by your desire to prove that you are loved.

> Now in a relationship with a man who is kind and attentive and committed, Isabel’s “I am lost” fire is not burning—which is a good thing!—and it can’t, therefore, ignite desire. Which doesn’t feel so good.

> Solution? Isabel needs to advance the plot.

I have a feeling that this is part of the reason behind hookup culture in order to [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|avoid one's feelings and becoming attached to another person]].

### Finding better coping strategies for solace sex

> [!quote] Modern romance novels aka "Porn for the ladies"
> Many romance novels these days are not like Jane Eyre or Pride and Prejudice. They have sex in them. A lot of sex. Some of them have so much sex, they’re basically Porn For The Ladies. But the best romance novels are the ones where the sex isn’t just gratuitous for the sake of entertainment. In the best romances, the sex advances the plot, carrying the hero and heroine, against all odds and in the face of many obstacles, through one of the behavioral markers of attachment.
>
> As just one example, the heroine of Laura Kinsale’s Flowers from the Storm keeps trying to leave the hero and return to her father, but as she rides away she grows “more uneasy every mile” ([[We love through attachment behaviors|separation distress]]) “until she turns her back on her father and returns” to the hero ([[We love through attachment behaviors|proximity seeking]]) and reunites with him, with, ahem, “rough vigor.”

"Sex that we crave often isn't sex that feels good."^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]] There's a different between enjoying and eagerness as covered in our [[Mesolimbic pathway is the emotional center of the brain|emotional One Ring]]. Sex and unstable relationships doesn't necessarily feel good - it is more of a relief and may be a [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behavior]]. This is a common occurrence in unstable relationships or new ones.

> Sue Johnson describes this “solace sex” as “soothing but unerotic,” in contrast to “sealed-off sex,” which is “erotic but empty.”^[Johnson, Love Sense, 121.] Solace sex can feel like a relief, because you’re easing fear. But let’s not mistake relief for pleasure.

## Secure attachment leads to greater sexual well-being

People with [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|secure attachments]] tend to have a more satisfying sex life. "Secure attachers have the healthiest, most pleasurable sex lives."^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]

Secure attachers have:
- more positive emotions during sex
- more frequent sex
- higher levels of [[Sexual context influences our arousal|sexual arousal]] and orgasm
- better communication about sex.

> They are better at giving and receiving consent and are more likely to engage in safer sex practices such as contraception use; they enjoy sex more, are more attentive to their partners’ needs, feel a link between sex and [[Love can take many forms and definitions|love]], are more likely to have sex in the context of a committed relationship, and are more sexually self-confident.
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

On the contrary, those with [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|anxious attachment]] styles are likely to engage in [[Broken attachment driven sex|solace sex]].

## Insecure attachment leads to poor sexual well-being

> People with [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|anxious attachment styles]]  are the most likely to engage in anxiety-driven “solace sex”—that is, using sex as an attachment behavior—which can make sex intense without making it pleasurable. Anxious attachers worry more about sex, and yet they also equate the quality of sex with the quality of a relationship. They’re more likely to experience pain with sex, particularly in low-intimacy relationships. They’re less likely to use condoms, more likely to use alcohol or other drugs before sex and, unsurprisingly, have higher rates of STIs and unwanted pregnancy. Anxious attachers experience more pain, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]], and health risks.
>
> People with insecure [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment styles]], anxious or avoidant, are more likely to be involved on either side of a coercive sexual relationship.
>
> People with avoidant attachment start having sex later in life, have sex less often, with fewer noncoital behaviors. They have more positive attitudes toward sex outside committed relationships, have more one-night stands, and are more likely to have sex just to fit into a social expectation rather than because they really want to. **Avoidant attachers** experience sex as less connected with their lives and their relationships.
>
> In the end, insecure attachment interferes with sex. We can’t understand sexual wellbeing without understanding attachment, and we can’t maximize our own sexual wellbeing without learning how to manage attachment in our relationships.
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]
