According to Robert Waldinger, people in romantic relationships who show [[A bedrock of affection during conflict will lead to a long-lasting relationship|affection during conflicts]] are more likely to stay together.

Use best practices when dealing with relationship conflicts. These are also strategies for navigating conflicts in relationships which apply as equally to romantic partners as well as other [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|psychologically intimate relationships]]. Often times, conflicts are born out of [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|mismatched expectations]].

As a result, we should learn how to argue properly, learn to support and [[Relationships will change over time|evolve the relationship over time]] if we wish to have a healthier and happier relationship. Communication and good conflict resolution skills are key as a result. Early on within relationship, we should focus on developing [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive coping skills]] to handle conflicts within the relationship.

They are key to maintaining [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|emotional intimacy]] within the relationship and can lead to [[Sustaining long term romantic desire in monogamous relationships|long-term romantic love]]. At the heart of it all - remember to solve the problem together, not against each other. The goal is to win together to develop a more fulfilling relationship.

## Fight the problem together not against each other

Winning together in a relationship is more fulfilling than against one another. It's important to practice [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|non-violent Communication (NVC)]].

> 1. **Commit to fight the problem**, not each other. This makes it possible to tackle the problem together and win.
> 2. **Use “I”, not “you” in disagreements.** [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|Own your feelings]] and understanding of the situation while giving the other person time and space to defend theirs.
> 3. **Avoid “you always” and “you never”.** These are sweeping statements that are not true.
> 4. **Practice in the calm.** Don’t wait until arguments flare up to set boundaries or guidelines for using conflict resolution strategies.

## Conflicts in relationships are normal and not an indicator of its health

- [[Conflicts in relationships are normal]]

### Common sources of relationship conflicts

Here are some common sources of relationship conflicts:

- Communication breakdowns which may lead to [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|misunderstandings - a result of mismatched expectations]]
- Difference in values and beliefs on the topics of relationship, politics or [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|personal priorities]]
- Financial disagreements which is a [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|common source of stress]]
- [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|Personal insecurities]] and lack of resolution in personal traumas
- [[Spend quality time with the people you love|Lack of time spent together]]

Often time, conflict can signal that [[Human emotions have an adaptive purpose|someone is in pain]] - and it is our job to approach our partner with a sense of curiosity to understand the source of that nature with [[Meaningful conversations require humility and exploration|humility in our conversation]].

## Recognize all feelings and perspectives as equally valid in relationships

> **Your feelings are neither more nor less important than your partner’s.** Your pain doesn’t automatically make your experience more valid, nor does your partner’s pain make your partner’s experience more valid.
>
> When we are in [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|emotional pain]], we tend to prioritize easing that pain over respecting our partner’s experience, so we have to remind ourselves that our different experiences matter equally.

It's important to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|honour each person's feelings]] and give them the appropriate space to engage in [[Honest communication is clear|honest communication]]. We should seek to acknowledge their personal realities which differs from ours and avoid assuming that only our perspective is correct.  Remember that they grew up in their own unique [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal garden]].

Be careful of [[confirmation bias|confirmation bias]] when it comes to interpreting the situation and really seek to [[Listen with empathy during conversations|listen with empathy]] and use the [[Use Imago Dialogue to create a safe space for relationship communication|imago dialogue]] to truly reflect your partner's communications.

When expressing feelings, make sure to do it from your own personal perspective using "I" language such as in [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|non-violent Communication (NVC)]].

### Each person is responsible for their feelings

> Each of you is 100 percent responsible for your own feelings. Partners in healthy relationships choose to help each other with their feelings, but it is always a choice. We [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|"turn toward our partner’s needs"]] , as relationship researcher John Gottman puts it, and when our partner supports us, we express our [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|gratitude]] for that choice.

Practice [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|empathy]] towards yourself and your partner as well as [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|gratitude]]. Learn to recognize your [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common humanity]].  [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|Own your emotional center of gravity]].

We should learn to recognize if we're dealing with [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict people]] and establish healthy [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|healthy relationship boundaries]].

## Take responsibility for your poor behaviour

Learn to identify [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|when you are becoming defensive]] and instead try to practice communicating your source of hurt through [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]]. Do your best to [[Honest communication is clear|communicate with honesty]]

Don't stonewall or run away from your emotions but instead take [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]]. It might require you to [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|be humble in order to learn something about yourself and your relationship]].

### Identify external stressors to your relationship

Based on my discussion with my friend %%[[Poe Han Thar Kyaw|Poe]]%% sometimes, we can fail to recognize that there are external [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|sources of stress]] which may be [[Approach-avoidance behaviours|making it difficult to approach]] our partner with kindness. It may lead us to become close-minded or less empathetic as a result.

Perhaps there's been a great [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|source of transition in your life]] such [[Examples of life transitions|changing jobs]] recently, etc. which makes it difficult to be [[Active listening is fully listening to understand|actively listen]] to your partner and may make you less open [[Attentional bias|to noticing]] your partner's [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|sliding door moments]].

We may become so exhausted in our fighting, and thinking we're putting our best foot forward to realize that we are no longer in a sound state of mind that we are unable to remember our [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|social bonds and the gift of the relationship]] with our partner.

Sometimes, it's better to [[Tong-Len philosophy is exchanging hurt for empathy|exchange hurt for empathy]] even if we're not feeling great at the moment.

## Do not take the other person for granted

Do not take the other person for granted. [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|Be appreciative and thankful]] for your [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|social bond]]. Remember that they are an [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|esteemed person within your life]].

Revisit your happy memories together. [[Happiness requires action|Happiness is a result of intentional actions and needs to be engineered]]. See also [[Use the Day Reconstruction Method to track happiness|Day Reconstruction Method]].

### Make special time for the other person

[[The five love languages|Spend quality time]] with them or do things outside of your usual routine. [[Sustaining long term romantic desire in monogamous relationships|Sustaining long term desire in monogamous relationships]] requires us to put out [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate effort]].

Instead of doing the usual, how about practicing the [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|opposite signal strategy]]? Go on adventures you would not have normally done, experience [[Learning new things is often difficult|new things]] together to create mystery and excitement.

## Maintain affection even during relationship conflicts

- [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|Avoid high-conflict behaviour]]
- [[Treat poor behaviour with kindness|Be kind to others even if they are acting poorly]]
- [[A bedrock of affection during conflict will lead to a long-lasting relationship]]
- [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|Honouring our social bonds]]

## Recognize when conflicts resemble parental upbringing patterns

See [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences]]

## Most relationship conflicts are about failures of emotional connection

According to [[REF Invest in Your Relationship The Emotional Bank Account|Invest in Your Relationship: The Emotional Bank Account]], most couples' fight are about 'nothing'. They're not about finances, sex, parenting, etc but rather about failure to emotionally connect such as not paying attention to each others' needs or expressing interesting in our partner's interests. They're about [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|feeling misunderstood]].

We may be missing their [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|bids of connection]] as a result of inattention or [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|distractions]]. It can start by acknowledging feelings and being present with them with everyday gestures of appreciation, understanding, affection and kindness.

## Look for the deeper roots of conflicts in values

## Approach criticism in romantic relationships as legitimate feedback

The author proposes a different approach to [criticism in relationships](https://thepowermoves.com/fixing-criticism-in-relationships/).

Criticism indeed often tells as much about the criticized partner as it says about ourselves, which is what we should explore more.

Here is how to go about criticism:

1. Accept that the criticism you receive from your partner has some basis in reality
2. Much of the criticism of your partner is because of our own unmet (childhood) needs
3. Sometimes we criticize our partner for what we lack ourselves
4. Our criticism might come from our lost self and a wish to be more like what we criticize in our partner

## Antidotes to the Four Horsemen of toxic relationship conflicts

The solution to these behaviors of the Four Horsemen includes:
- [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|using "I" statements]]
- [[Listen with empathy during conversations|non-defensive listening]]
- understanding the partner's perspective by respecting their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique garden]]
- taking responsibility for your personal actions

Developing a growth mindset and an antifragile ego can also help. Changing the attitude towards the partner into one of appreciation can combat contempt, while taking a break from the argument and resuming with calmness can address stonewalling.
