Using facts and thinking about [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|internalized exterior friendly voices]], we can remind and ground ourselves to be objective about circumstances rather than listening to [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|automatic thoughts]] from the [[Dealing with our inner critic|critical voice]]. We need to remind ourselves when [[Mental illness insists that the brain is still healthy|mental illness shuts down our brain]] that we may no longer be in control, and we feel excessive despair and [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopelessness]].

This is a skill which we can use to [[Skills to develop personal resilience and overcome adversity|develop resilience and mental strength]]

- Are the extent of my feelings appropriate to the situation? Or do I have [[Cognitive distortions|distorted view of reality]] and feel like it's a bigger deal than it is?
- Am I being [[You are not your inner critic|overly critical]] of myself? Am I not recognizing my [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|value as a person]] and instead succumbing to [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]]?
- Is this issue going to last forever? Or is this pain merely temporary? [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|Nothing lasts forever]], including negative emotions.
- Am I engaging in [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] or am I sticking to the fact of the situation by [[Seeing the world as it is is being realistic|being realistic]]?

## Why are we so pessimistic?

Our minds are constantly scanning for future potential threats or [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|ruminating]] so it can be important to quiet our [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|inner chatter]]. With the advent of the 24-hour news cycle, our [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] can help us only remind of the doom and gloom which seems to exist everywhere - an artifact of our minds not being able to cope with the modern world.

[[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|Higher levels of cognitive functions]] take time to kick in. [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|Pessimism and loneliness hijack our decision loops]]. [[Being patient leads to better decisions|Be patient.]] Remember that [[Being patient leads to better decisions|bad things are temporary]]. This can be a [[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts|difficult challenge]] but it can help us [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|grow as a person]].
