# Reading effectively

According to [[REF How to Read a Book The Ultimate Guide by Mortimer Adler|How to Read a Book - The Ultimate Guide by Mortimer Adler]], here are the main lessons to take away when it comes to reading a book:
- Each reading technique has its place or niche use
- In order to truly understand the knowledge we are absorbing, we need to [[Writing to learn|write to learn]].
- One of the techniques to increasing reading speed is to take advantage of [[Priming effects|priming effects]] by understanding the overall structure of what will be reading. If we feel like we know what is coming up, we can better mentally prepare for the information

## Use the appropriate style of reading for the right content

Most people read to get [[Transform information into knowledge|information not knowledge]]. The purpose or intention of our reading also changes how we decide to process the actual information and we may adapt our reading technique accordingly.

## The four primary reading techniques

There are four main levels of reading aka techniques [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|which can help us process information into knowledge]]:
- Elementary reading is basic mechanical reading to recognize the 'symbols' of words
- [[Inspectional reading is skimming a book for quick understanding|inspectional reading]] is skimming a book to understanding its main points and structure
- [[Read slowly to process information more deeply|analytical reading]] is done to more deeply process information within a subject
- [[Syntopical Reading is compare and contrast of multiple knowledge sources|syntopical reading]] is done to compare books and various points of view centered around a specific subject

## Ask the following questions before reading a book

> -   What is being said in detail, and how?
> -   Is this book true in whole or in part?
> -   What of it?

## My thoughts on reading effectively

I think more so than necessarily processing information and turning into knowledge it's better to learn [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] and particular frameworks. In that way you can apply your conceptual knowledge from an existing source of information to something that's new and easily apply what you know.

I find that having knowledge across multiple domains tends to be more similar in an abstract form than individually specific. It's true that there's always details that are going to be different but if we learn to abstract things enough that can sometimes be good. We don't need to be an expert on everything. I think there's a lot of value in [[Being a generalist means having a broad set of skills and interests|being a generalist]].

The key skillset is to know know when to ask for advice and get to the critical questions as necessary. Call it being a polymath?
