> [!NOTE] Combating loneliness
> In a 2017 article titled [The Social Muscle External link](https://hbr.org/2017/10/the-social-muscle/), researchers John Cacioppo and Stephanie Cacioppo argue that much like the muscles in the body that need [[Benefits of exercise|regular exercise]] in order to be fit and healthy, loneliness can be combated through a regular regimen of social fitness exercises.

> The researchers conducted a five-year research study on loneliness within the US Army and came up with a training program to improve social fitness among soldiers. This training program consisted of interventions that ranged from simple tasks to more complex activities that provided soldiers with the tools to combat their own feeling of loneliness and isolation, as well as help others who may also be experiencing these feelings.

Just as bodies need [[Benefits of exercise|regular exercise]] to maintain physical health, we need to create strong mental habits to improve our mental health. It's like gym for the brain. Fighting loneliness is like an exercise in social fitness.

We have an inherent need to stretch our muscles to be fit and healthy. The equivalent of mental atrophy is [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|feeling isolated]]. It can lead us to turn inwards, engage in [[Self-protection and anxiety avoidance|protective behaviours and create behaviours to avoid the source of anxieties]]. This in turn can lead us to becoming closed off, physically as well as mentally (to new ideas).

## Strategies for dealing with loneliness

Here are five key strategies for improving our social fitness (lifted from [[REF The Social Muscle|The Social Muscle]]):
1. [[Digital Minimalism|Unplug from the digital world]] and create moments of physical interactions. Avoid [[Social media encourages loneliness|social media as it promotes loneliness]]. Here are some strategies for [[Reduce personal social media usage|reducing social media usage]].
2. Do small favours by being nice or helpful to others by choosing to [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|practicing gratitude]]
3. Seek opportunities to work together with others and collaborate.
4. Reach out to others [[Expanding our friendship network|by meeting new people]] - outside of our comfort zone to discover new areas of knowledge, new opinions. It's a good way of increasing our [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|knowledge of diversity]].
5. Saying hello to others - to a friend, a stranger or someone to which we simply wish to reconnect
6. Seeking to improve our [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|shame resilience]]

## Oxytocin is primarily released during external social contact

[[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|Oxytocin]] is a gift that we give to other people. It's actually very difficult to make our own brains release oxytocin according to [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Dr. Paul Zak]].

1. Rebuild social connections by giving back
2. Avoid isolation and [[Third Place|go hang out where others humans]] are
3. Get a pet who will also help you produce oxytocin

When we feel lonely, one of the best things we can do is rebuild our social connections. That can take many forms, such as volunteering, helping out others. giving a [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|thank you.]] It's a form of [[Elevating others also benefits us|selfish altruism]] and is a form of reciprocal relationship. 

Help yourself feel better by making others feel better :)

The other thing we can do is avoiding isolation by [[Third Place|going out to where others]] are such as a coffee shop, a bar, and striking a conversation. It's not necessarily to form a relationship but simply saying hi can be good enough.

The other third hack is animals. Research on at dogs and cats tell us that they help us build oxytocin. So getting a pet isn't the worst idea to overcome loneliness

On the other hand, [[Social media encourages loneliness|social media is the junk food of social connection]].

## Personal reflections on overcoming loneliness

### Overstretching my social muscles

As an extrovert, I think I sometimes take it too far, and it might be driven by my need for constant reassurance and the [[The trauma of abandonment|trauma of abandonment]] by being around other people. And so sometimes I overexert myself, which leads to fatigue. I think it's better to use a better pacing strategy that is more sustainable. Too much of a good thing can be bad y'know?

Perhaps it's better to [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|limit my social commitment]] to [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|manage my energy]].

### Gifting a friend to overcome loneliness

A while back, I was feeling very lonely. I had the choice to stay at home and be completely isolated. However, I thought that giving a friend a gift and using it as an excuse to visit her might be a [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|better coping style]]. I ended up making a portrait of her dog in a meme format and she ended up crying tears of joy. It definitely warmed my heart and is one of my favourite [[Nuggets of happiness|nugget of happiness]].
