# Love is the pursuit of our wholeness to find an emotional home

#status/wip

---

Love is about finding our lost selves - stemming from [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|childhood wounds]] as it relates to our [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment systems]]. It is the [[Human emotions have an adaptive purpose|evolutionary adaptation of emotional mechanisms]] that bonds an infant and adult caregiver. From birth, as babies, we pursue [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|attachment]] in the pursuit of our wholeness because others hold onto parts of our heart. **Attachment is love.**

> When you're a parent, your heart is running around in someone else's body.

When we reach adolescence our attachment mechanisms, switch from parental attachment to **peer attachment** in romantic relationships. Examples of attachment behaviours (common between parent-child or romantic partners) includeeye-contact smiling, face stroking, hugging. It's part of the body language %%(further explored in [[What Every BODY is Saying by Joe Navarro Marvin Karlins|What Every BODY is Saying by Joe Navarro]] )%% we use to display attachment.

After adolescence, the nuance of [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexual behavior in relationships]] is added. Sometimes this can go wrong and we engage in [[Broken attachment driven sex|solace sex]].

## A partner should be your emotional home

The [[Finding the right romantic partner|right romantic partner]] should accept us unconditionally without [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame]] or judgement.  They listen to us with their full attention and with [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|proper feedback]] can learn to attend to some of our emotional needs. We're allowed to experience our full spectrums of feelings in a safe environment while receiving their loving presence.

![[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-24988]]

I think in my previous relationship %%with [[Melodie Zhou]]%%, I was not that great at such behaviours. I wish I had know more about the [[Use Imago Dialogue to create a safe space for relationship communication|Imago Dialogue technique]] I had much runway for [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]] and a lot of my own personal [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] to deal with so I wasn't able to be there for her in the way I should have been.

It is one of my regrets - but she seems happy now. I should have allowed her to experience her feelings, [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|to truly ground myself in her emotions]], and really try to understand instead of downplaying them.

## Why do we fall in love?

- [What is Imago? - Harville and Helen](https://harvilleandhelen.com/initiatives/what-is-imago/)

Understanding this question means that we can understand what happens when we fall in and out of love. It also means that we can start understanding what is really going on [[Best practices for handling relationship conflicts|when couples fight]] and the [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|source of relationship conflict]].

As a child when we are born, we expect our caretakers to be attuned to our wants and needs, ready and available to provide us with warmth and safety and sustenance, and it allows us to feel whole. We expect a certain sense of [[Perfectionism|perfect]] [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|emotional attunement]] from our [[Parents have a profound impact on child development|parents]].

However, they are only human, and even in the best of circumstances, they will not be able to provide this. Perhaps they are dealing with their own demons and the vicious cycles of [[Generational trauma|generational trauma]]. They may not be physically or [[Emotional availability|emotionally]] available, understand what is needed or meet every single demand. They may be tired, angry, depressed, busy, ill, distracted and afraid. In other words, they are dealing with their own personal sources of stress. As a result, parents are sometimes unable to sustain feelings of security and comfort towards their child leading to possible [[Early childhood experiences exert lifelong outcomes|lifelong outcomes]].

[[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|Unmet needs in childhood]] lead to fear and pain, causing us to develop primitive coping mechanisms. Throughout our lives, we are molded by society's expectations and repress parts of ourselves. We may have had "good enough" caretakers, but we all carry wounds from childhood. As adults, we try to navigate the world and relationships while longing to regain our sense of aliveness. Falling in love briefly restores that feeling of safety and joy.

[[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|Early emotional wounds often become themes of relationship conflicts]].


## Love stems from a sense of attachment

> [!quote] Attachment is love -- Emily Nagoski
> Love, according to the parable, is the pursuit of our own wholeness. We wander the earth in search of our lost half. And when two halves find each other, as Aristophanes says,

> > “the pair are lost in an amazement of love and [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|friendship]] and intimacy, and one will not be out of the other’s sight, as I may say, even for a moment: these are the people who pass their whole lives together; yet they could not explain what they desire of one another.”
>
> This isn’t actually why we fall in love, but it’s closer than you might think. [[We love through attachment behaviors|Why we fall in love]] is attachment, which is sort of a biological pursuit of wholeness.
