# Smarter brains are more efficient in processing glucose

## Overview of theory of neural efficiency

> [!warning] Pretty new hypothesis
> This seems like an idea that's pretty brand new as there's very little literature about it.
> **Reference:** [Neural efficiency hypothesis - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_efficiency_hypothesis)

Presented by Haier et al in 1992, the **neural efficiency theory** indicates that those with [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]] may benefit from more *efficient processing* of glucose (the brain's energy provider) for cerebral activities.

At a baseline level (when idle), the brain consumes less glucose than the norm. However, during *complex and demanding* tasks, those with HPI will consume an **above-average** amount of glucose. ^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907682/#:~:text=The%20neural%20efficiency%20hypothesis%20describes,on%20the%20same%20cognitive%20tasks.]

> [!question] Link to dopamine and reward systems?
> Is there a relationship between this lack of glucose and [[dopamine|dopamine]] seeking patterns? I feel like there's a link to reward systems that I don't understand.

> That would imply that there's a link to the [[Mesocorticolimbic system|Mesocorticolimbic system processes reward motivation and decision making]]? 

## Studies on neural efficiency theory

Everything is from 2007 and later. Pretty new.
