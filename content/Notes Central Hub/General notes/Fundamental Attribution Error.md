> The fundamental attribution error refers toÂ **an individual's tendency to attribute another's actions to their character or personality, while attributing their behavior to external situational factors outside of their control**

It is an example of [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive bias]] and might be an example of a [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behavior]] of [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|people who have traits of being high-conflict]]. 

It's seeing ourselves in the light of our circumstances while we make [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|judgments about others]] as a part of their character. Consider if there are other plausible alternatives for why someone acted a certain way versus than it being an innate character trait.

To reduce our bias, think of the [[OODA Loop]] and [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|practice mindfulness]] in order to get a pulse on your impulsive thoughts.

[[Treat poor behaviour with kindness|Be more kind to others]] as they're probably just having a bad day. Maybe they shit their pants or something - idk.
