# We experience cognitive dissonance to resolve mental inconsistency

## What is cognitive dissonance?

> In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the perception of contradictory [[Information overconsumption|information]], and the mental toll of it. Relevant items of information include a person's actions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, values, and things in the environment.

Why are some people reluctant about learning new things? Because it challenges their [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]] and forces them to re-evaluate [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|new information]]. It takes [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|mental effort]] to undergo [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual change]]. It's something which can be learned through [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|deliberate practice]] and changed ([[Neuroplasticity]]).

Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon that occurs when an individual experiences discomfort or tension due to holding two or more contradictory beliefs, attitudes, or values simultaneously. This inconsistency between one's beliefs and behavior can lead to an uncomfortable psychological state that motivates the individual to reduce or resolve the dissonance.

Understanding cognitive dissonance can help in predicting and influencing human behavior, and it is an important concept in fields such as social psychology, marketing, and communication.

### Scientific theory of cognitive dissonance

The theory of cognitive dissonance was first proposed by psychologist Leon Festinger in 1957. According to Festinger, humans have an innate drive to maintain consistency and harmony between their cognitions (beliefs, attitudes, and values) and their actions. When inconsistencies arise, they create a state of mental discomfort, which individuals are motivated to reduce or resolve.

See also [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome]] to see how one can reduce cognitive dissonance.

## What is the role of cognitive dissonance?

Cognitive dissonance plays a significant role in various aspects of human behavior and decision-making, including:

-   Persuasion and attitude change: People may change their attitudes or beliefs when presented with new information that creates cognitive dissonance.
-   Post-decision dissonance: After making a difficult decision, individuals may experience dissonance between their choice and the attractive features of the rejected alternative. This can lead to rationalizing or justifying the decision in order to reduce the dissonance.
-   Effort justification: When people put significant effort into a task or goal, they may experience dissonance if the outcome is not as rewarding as expected. They might then justify the effort by exaggerating the value or importance of the goal.

## How do we attempt to resolve cognitive dissonance?

There are several ways in which individuals may attempt to resolve cognitive dissonance:

1.  Changing beliefs, attitudes, or values: The individual may modify their beliefs or attitudes to align them with their behavior. For example, if a person values environmental conservation but drives a gas-guzzling car, they may change their attitude towards environmentalism to reduce the dissonance.
2.  Changing behavior: The individual may alter their behavior to bring it in line with their beliefs or values. In the previous example, the person might choose to buy a more environmentally-friendly car or start using public transportation to reduce the inconsistency.
3.  Adding new beliefs or rationalizations: The individual may introduce new beliefs or justifications that help to reconcile the conflicting beliefs or attitudes. For example, the person might justify their gas-guzzling car by saying that they need it for work or that they compensate for their environmental impact in other ways.
4.  Selective exposure to information: To maintain cognitive consistency, individuals may avoid information that challenges their existing beliefs or attitudes, and instead seek out information that confirms or supports their beliefs.
