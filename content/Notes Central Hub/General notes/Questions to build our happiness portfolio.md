#### Personal reflections on faith and life philosophy

What do I think about the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]]? That's a good question. Apparently, when I was five years old, I asked my mom, why are we here on earth? What's our purpose here? And the funny thing is that I never got a good answer. Here I am a thirty years old, and I'm pondering this question.

I think the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]] is that perhaps there is no meaning other than the one we make. And the ones worth making are the [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connections to others]].

I think life is at its best when I get to spend time with my loved ones, [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|do the things I want]], and [[Curiosity as my worldview|discover new things to understand more about the world]].

The question, which is much harder, is, what are my goals in life? I'm not exactly sure yet. I think I want to study the nature of consciousness and intelligence. At the same time, I would like to sustain a lifestyle where I get to have the freedom to explore things and engage in new hobbies with little financial overhead.

### Family

> [!question] Family
> Write down the people who are, or who you consider to be, your family.
>
> If you don’t have a family, think of your very closest friends—the people you would call in the middle of the night in an emergency

### Community and friends

> [!question] Family
> Ask yourself, where do I experience community? Where are most of my friends?
>
> Write down the clubs, teams, or friend groups you are a part of that give you a sense of [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|friendship]] and community

- Friend groups
	- [[Gary crew|Gary and cycling friends]]
	- My childhood friends from Ottawa
	- Couch reaction meme squad in Toronto
	- My discord server.
- Volunteering and communities
	- Santropol Roulant and Santropol velo

Most of my friends are scattered across the world. Many of them live in different cities. With that being said, I guess there are lots of individuals within Montreal itself. I think it's hard to say because I'm not really part of clubs or teams.

### Meaningful work

> [!question] Meaningful work
> What work do you do that you consider meaningful? What type of work do you do that makes you feel energetic and valuable?
>
> It may be your full-time job or volunteer work.

Work that is meaningful to me is something that helps benefit humanity. I feel like it should be kind of the work that stimulates me intellectually. I should be [[Learning new things is often difficult|learning new things]]. I should be helping connect people. I should be helping make things more efficient. I want to know that my work is having a meaningful impact and is helping out others around me. I don't like building things for the sake of building things and dealing with politics, where people have their own selfish intentions. I want to feel like I'm part of a community where I can have my own meaningful voice.
