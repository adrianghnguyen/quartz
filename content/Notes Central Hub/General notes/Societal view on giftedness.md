## Explaining society's taboo on high intellectual potential

Society has lacked a lot of research in this field, especially since the 80s as we switched to a model of 'no child left behind' which has focused on raising the floor at the expense of not considering the ceiling. Some of it is tied in western's society judeo-christian values of humility and modesty and to shun success and richness^[p.178 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]. As a result, some families experience tensions and may become ostracized by their peers or extended family when talking about their gifted child. This can become a source of shame for many.

Having a child with HPI ([[High intellectual potential overview]]) can be a wonderful gift as a parent ([[How to best raise a potentially gifted child]]). However, trying to discuss this with others may get you scorn - perceived as bragging or arrogance. As a result, it can become a taboo to approach this subject, similar to discussing salaries openly in society otherwise it's seen as showing off.

## Myths and facts about high intellectual potential

Myth | Veracity |  Additional comments
---| --- | ---
HPI is a synonym of superior [[Intelligence as a concept|intelligence]] or high IQ scores ([[IQ Test]]) therefore a gifted person will excel in all domains | False | See more on [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]
All children can be gifted or have the potential to become gifted | False |  [[Stages of talent development]]
All children could develop talent with enough effort or [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]] | False | [[Talent is dedication by few]]
A child who had early developmental milestones or had exceptional performance must be the result of overbearing and demanding parents | False | [[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI]]
Once gifted, always gifted. | False |
All gifted children are lucky and privileged by nature. They will automatically succeed in school and adulthood. | False | [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children]]
An intellectually gifted child will not have any learning difficulties | False | [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children#Twice Exceptionalism of HPI Aka Double Exceptionality]]
A gifted child has no need for particular accommodations and it would be unfair to do provide suitable adaptations | False | See support networks - [[Ingredients for HPI Development]] and [Gifted Education’s Failings](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330611534_Gifted_Education's_Failings)
It is dangerous to talk about the giftedness to the child or to the people surrounding them. They may become arrogant, judgemental of others, develop an air of superiority and be demanding. | False | See notes on emotional hypersensitivity and empathy ([[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children]])

I can see how these statements may be uncomfortable for people as it kicks in their [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defense mechanisms]] or it's a way of reducing their cognitive dissonance ([[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency]]). It would indeed hurt their self-esteem and perceived self-image through comparison ([[Why you should not compare yourself to others]])
