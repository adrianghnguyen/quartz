# Great work possesses traits of autonomy, creativity and impact

There are three main factors which will determine if we think our work is worthwhile. These go hand in hand with our personal [[Humans are motivated to grow|motivations]], an internal factor and external results (your output aka work).

It's something worth considering when [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|a career with a path towards increasingly better work]].

See also [[Purpose in life|Develop purpose in life by setting a personal ambition]]

## Creativity in our personal work

- Ability to explore interesting ideas to the person
- Ira Glass, for example, is pushing the boundaries of radio, and winning armfuls of awards in the process.

## Impact in our personal work

- Ability to drive worthwhile outcomes and results in one's work
- Ex: From the Apple II to the iPhone, Steve Jobs has changed the way we live our lives in the digital age.

## Control and autonomy in our personal work

One's autonomy over how they'll approach a problem while doing their job. It's having a say in what you do and how you do it. This is one of the most important traits to acquire with your [[Career capital|career capital]] when creating work you love.

It's closely related to the human need for [[Self-Determination Theory seeks to understand how we make motivations related to behaviour and personality|self-determination]].

> No one tells Al Merrick when to wake up or what to wear. He’s not expected in an office from nine to five.

> Instead, his Channel Island Surfboards factory is located a block from the Santa Barbara beach, where Merrick still regularly spends time surfing. ( Jake Burton Carpenter, founder of Burton Snowboards, for example, recalls how negotiations for the merger between the two companies happened while he and Merrick waited for waves in a surf lineup.)

### Traps for desiring control without the right foundations

1. Control acquired *without career capital* is not sustainable and cannot become part of your lifestyle. Example: quitting 9-5 job to become a lifestyle blogger without anything of substance to offer)
2. When you acquire enough career capital to acquire meaningful  over your working life, that’s exactly when you’ve become valuable enough to your current employer that *they will try to prevent you from making the change*. You will encounter resistance from friends, family who will wish for you to preserve the status quo.
	1. Example: In [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]], the QA lead asked her employer to reduce her work hours in order to do part-time studies. If she had asked when she was a junior at the company, they would've let her go.
	2. To sidestep the trap of control one should remember the [[Good ideas get paid|Law of financial viability]] - people will give you money if they think your ideas and execution is good.
