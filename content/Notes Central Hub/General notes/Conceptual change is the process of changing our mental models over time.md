# Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time

The process by which we develop and evolve our understanding of knowledge over time.

> **Conceptual change** is the process whereby [concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept "Concept") and relationships between them change over the course of an individual person's lifetime or over the course of history. Research in four different fields – [cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology "Cognitive psychology"), [cognitive developmental psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_development "Cognitive development"), [science education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_education "Science education"), and [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science "History of science") and [philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") - has sought to understand this process. Indeed, the convergence of these four fields, in their effort to understand how concepts change in content and organization, has led to the emergence of an interdisciplinary sub-field in its own right. This sub-field is referred to as "conceptual change" research.

## Origins of conceptual change

> Cognitive psychologists studied the process of conceptual change and its two counterpoints:
> 1. [Closed-mindedness][1]: The reluctance to consider ideas which conflict with one's own established beliefs.
> 2. [Belief perseverance][2]: The tendency to cling to such ideas even after they have suffered decisive refutations. For instance, in the 1950s, Festinger, Riecken, and Schachter[^1] [joined][3] a cult whose members shared the belief that the world would [end][4] on December 21, 1954. After the prediction failed, most believers still clung to their earlier [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|conceptual framework]]. Subsequent investigations confirmed and amplified the results of these initial experiments.[^2]

## Conceptual change requires feedback

In order to keep growing, we need to keep re-evaluating our [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] to see if they are beneficial to our world understanding of the world. If something doesn't seem right, there may exist friction friction, we may be lacking the right [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] - something I learned from the [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman|The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]].

Essentially, we need to perform [[Continuous feedback leads to change|continuous feedback loops]] to [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gain further information]] and then do some [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] to determine our path forward. This is not meant to be easy as we may experience [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]] as we have to admit that we may be lacking in knowledge, because it's outside our [[Recognize your circle of competence|circle of competence]], the [[Half-life of knowledge and its decay|knowledge is outdated]] or we simply need to [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gather additional information]].

Perhaps we are stuck in our ways because we have not examined our personal biases. This is something we can learn to improve through [[Preventing cognitive bias using cognitive forcing strategies|cognitive forcing strategies]] to engage in [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|critical thinking]].

## One of education's goals is to develop new ways of examining information

When trying to learn, the goal is to induce [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual change]] by helping the subject develop new ways of examining information by helping induce [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|critical thinking skills]]. In the [[Writing to learn|writing to learn paradigm]], the acts of producing knowledge units through the act of writing as well as interacting with the ideas is meant to stimulate this [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive process]].

> In educational technology, conceptual change is an issue that occurs at several levels:
>
> - At the system level (see [change management](https://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Change_management "Change management"))
> - At the teacher/informal workplace learner level
> - At the student/formal learner level
