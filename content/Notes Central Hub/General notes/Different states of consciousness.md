## Different states of consciousness

> [!warning] We still know little
> The study of consciousness remains a topic of ongoing research and debate, and there is much we still don't understand about its nature and mechanisms.

Consciousness is a complex and multi-dimensional phenomenon that can be understood in different ways. Some models of consciousness propose that there are different states of consciousness that vary in their level of awareness, attention, and self-reflection.

Here are some examples:

| Types of consciousness | Explanation of consciousness type |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
Waking consciousness |  This is the state of consciousness that we experience during most of our waking hours. It involves a high level of awareness of the external world and our own thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations.
Sleep and dream states | These are altered states of consciousness that occur during sleep. During deep sleep, our consciousness is typically characterized by a lack of awareness of the external world, while during REM sleep (the stage of sleep when we dream), our consciousness becomes more active and vivid.
Altered states of consciousness| These are temporary changes in consciousness that can be induced by various means, such as meditation, hypnosis, drugs, or extreme situations. Examples include trance states, mystical experiences, or psychedelic experiences.
Dissociative states| These are states of consciousness that involve a disruption or disconnection between different aspects of one's mental experience, such as one's sense of identity, memories, emotions, or perceptions. Examples include dissociative disorders or experiences of depersonalization or derealization.
Comatose or vegetative states| These are states of consciousness that result from severe brain damage or injury, where the person is not fully awake or responsive to external stimuli.
[[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|Mindfulness]] | State of consciousness that involves paying attention to the present moment with openness, curiosity, and acceptance. It is a form of conscious awareness that allows individuals to observe their thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations without judgment or reaction.

These are just a few examples of the different states of consciousness that have been described by researchers and philosophers.
