To complete the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] cycle, we need to reduce both our **accelerators and brakes** by grounding ourselves in the present using techniques such as [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]]. If we think back to the metaphor of the [[Invisible lions of stress|invisible lion]], we need to fight or run.

When we're stressed out by our job, our sex life, We can choose to exercise or [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|engage in self-care]] which are great [[REF Unifying Theory of Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|protective buffers against stress responses]].

However at the same, time, [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stress]] actually impairs our ability to exercise.^[Stults-Kolehmainen, M. A., & Sinha, R. (2014). The effects of stress on physical activity and exercise. Sports medicine, 44, 81-121.] What a vicious cycle.

> Inevitably, it’s more complicated than that. There is a brake that, in a healthy nervous system, is linked with the autonomic gas pedal, so that when life hits the gas pedal, the brake disengages, and when life relaxes the gas pedal, the brake reengages—the neomammalian vagus, or “vagal brake” as Stephen Porges describes it.

## Paying attention to patterns of self-inhibition

We should practice an amount of [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|self-awareness]] to discover our patterns of self-inhibition and [[Context matters to your well-being|identify places or people which give us safe spaces]] to discharge our stress.

We need to find places where there will be no judgement or we won't freak other people out.

## Tunnel metaphor for stress - you have to go through it

> [[Human emotions have an adaptive purpose|Emotions]] are like tunnels: You have to walk all the way through the darkness to get to the light at the end. I say this so often my students sometimes roll their eyes: “Not the tunnel again.” Yes, the tunnel again. Because it’s true.
