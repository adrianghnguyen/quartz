Sexual desire factors create romantic attraction by increasing our [[SES and SIS are stable individual traits|sexual accelerator]].

This is mainly for women but I would assume it would also apply to men to some extent. These are things which would increase one's "turn-ons" or sexual accelerators for women. However, at the end of the day, the most important is [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|how we feel about our feelings aka meta-emotions.]]

There are four general categories^[McCall and Meston, “Cues Resulting in Desire,” and “Differences Between Pre- and Postmenopausal Women.”] which were identified:

| Type of cue                     | Summary                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Love and emotional bonding cues | Feeling loved, desired, and supported          |
| Explicit and erotic cues        | Environmental cues suggesting sex              |

## What gets women in a sexual mood?

> [!NOTE] Source
> [[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-2866]]

1. Having an attractive partner who respects them and accepts them as they are
2. Feeling trusting and affectionate in their relationship
3. Being confident and healthy—both emotionally and physically
4. Feeling desired by their partner, being approached in a way that makes them feel special
5. Explicit erotic cues, like erotica or porn, or hearing or seeing other people having sex

## Detailed explanations of cues for romantic desire

### Love and emotional bonding cues

These are related to [[Human emotions have an adaptive purpose|emotions]] and feelings.

Particularly:
- Feeling a sense of love, security, commitment, emotional closeness, protection
- Feeling support in your relationship,
- Feeling a kind of “special attention” from your partner

>   Example: A woman told me the extraordinarily romantic story of a boyfriend who flew halfway around the globe to surprise her for their second anniversary of dating. Talk about closeness, commitment, and special attention.

### Explicit and erotic cues

These would be environmental cues concerning the act of sex.

- Watching a sexy movie, reading an erotic story,
- Watching or hearing other people having sex
- Anticipating having sex
- Knowing your partner desires you
- Noticing your own or your partner’s arousal.

> Example: A woman in her twenties told me of a time when she woke up in the middle of the night in her boyfriend’s apartment, to the sound of the upstairs neighbors having sex. The rhythmic squeaking and grunting sighs instantly turned her on. She kissed her boyfriend awake and they listened together, then had fast, intense sex.

### Visual or proximity cues

These seem to be proxies for partners with good 'potential value' which may be social, physical or reproductive markers.

- Seeing an attractive, well-dressed potential partner
- A well-toned body
- Lots of confidence, [[Intelligence as a concept|intelligence]], and class.

> Example: A friend once said to me rhetorically, “What is it about the white cuffs of a shirt peeking out under a suit jacket?” I suggested, “Maybe a marker of a social status?” And she added, “That, and grooming. A man with pristine white cuffs is a man whose skin will taste good.”

### Romantic or implicit cues

These seem to behaviors promoting [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]] or a high sense of intimacy.

- intimate behaviors such as dancing closely, sharing a hot tub or massages or other intimate touch (like touching the face or hair), watching a sunset, laughing or whispering together, or smelling pleasant.

>   Example: A woman in her thirties told me that she and her husband were saving up to remodel their bathroom, after they realized that a reason she was so keen for sex when they went on vacation was that they took long, hot (in every sense) baths together in the giant tubs at the B and Bs where they stayed. More baths, more sex.

## General trends in the sexual responses of genders

> - Women, as a group, have more [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sensitive brakes]] and less [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sensitive accelerators]], though there’s lots of variation.
> - To a greater degree than men’s, women’s [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual response]] is sensitive to external circumstances and internal brain state—to context.
> - Women are less likely than men to experience concordance between their genital response and their subjective arousal.
> - And more women than men experience responsive or context-sensitive desire.
>
> All of which may come as a surprise to the 10–20 percent of women whose [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]] is similar to the “standard narrative.”

### The paradox of fading romantic desire

- Perel begins by addressing a fundamental question: Why does good sex often diminish in couples who continue to love each other deeply?
- She challenges the common belief that intimacy guarantees a satisfying sexual connection and delves into the concept of wanting what one already possesses.
