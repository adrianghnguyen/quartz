## Process to fix bad permalinks

1. Try to publish multiple notes within Obsidian then it throws error
2. Open up Notepad++ and open up Obsidian directory
3. Right click on Notes Central Hub folder and click on "Find in filesâ€¦"
4. In find search bar, I can put in regex expression
	1. The one to catch permalinks that have permalink url without surrounding quotes is the following
		1. `dg-permalink: [\d?]`
5. Go and edit those files then save them

### Found regex solution string

`dg-permalink: [\d?]`

### Look for these watch variables within [[Debugging ElectronJS]]
