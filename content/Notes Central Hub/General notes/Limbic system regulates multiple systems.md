The limbic system is one of the oldest components of our brain and is often responsible for our unconscious thoughts and reactions. It's also often referred to as the 'lizard brain.' It is a complex network of brain regions that work together to regulate emotions, memory, and motivation.

The main components of the limbic system include:

1. The [[Amygdala helps process emotions such as fear and aggression|amygdala]]
2. [[Hippocampus|Hippocampus]]
3. [[Thalamus]] and [[Hypothalamus|hypothalamus]]
4. [[Cingulate cortex|Cingulate cortex]]
5. Basal Ganglia

We can also think of it as our [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|emotional nervous system]] and it directs enjoying, expecting and eagerness systems which directs our basic physiological needs. When the limbic system malfunctions or goes haywire, we might experience loss of emotions and become reactive, such as in the case of trauma.

## Emotional processing component of the limbic system

The limbic system is involved in multiple core cognitive functions such as
- automatic processing of emotions
- memory
- motivation

More sort of emotions live in a region deep within the brain called the limbic system, where we process stimuli automatically such as in the case of [[Priming effects|priming effects]].

The Limbic System sends the signals to the front part of your brain called prefrontal cortex:
- where it processes conscious thought
- where we process feelings and figure out how to express positive or negative emotions.

1. The right side of our prefrontal cortex is more active when we process unhappiness
2. The left side is more active when we are processing happiness.
