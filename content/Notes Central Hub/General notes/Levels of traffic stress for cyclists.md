## What is levels of traffic stress aka LTS?

> LTS promises an objective, data-driven approach to evaluating bikeways by matching up roadway design, traffic volumes, and motor vehicle speeds to individual perceptions of bicyclist comfort and a willingness to travel out of ones’ way to maintain that level of comfort.^[https://blog.altaplanning.com/level-of-traffic-stress-what-it-means-for-building-better-bike-networks-c4af9800b4ee]

It's a way of helping cities determine how likely the average person is to take a certain bike facility for a particular level of protection. It provides 4 levels of ranking from LTS 4  to LTS 1. Level of Traffic Stress 4 represent the capacity of the confident cyclist, likely to engage in vehicular cycling - which honestly sucks but I do it out of necessity^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpnZy7RrO3I]). Level of Traffic Stress 1 represents the separated bike lane infrastructure which is comfortable for entire families including children.

It's a way of framing the [[User experience design|user experience (UX)]] markers in cycling infrastructure. Cities should aim for an LTS score 2 as their [[Detailed summary of bicycle path treatments|bike treatment paths]] benchmark of infrastructure development.^[Design Primer: Central City in Motion Project. Portland Bureau of Transportation. (p.5)]

### What are the types of levels of traffic stress?

| Level of traffic stress | Suitable for                                        |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| LTS 1                   | Safe for children                               |
| LTS 2                   | Acceptable for most adults                          |
| LTS 3                   | Medium discomfort for most adults                   |
| LTS 4                   | Confident cyclists comfortable in vehicular cycling |
