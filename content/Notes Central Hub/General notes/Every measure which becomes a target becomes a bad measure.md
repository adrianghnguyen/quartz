## Goodhart's law

>  'Goodhart's Law' – That every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure – is inexorably, if ruefully, becoming recognized as one of the overriding laws of our times. Ruefully, for this law of the unintended consequence seems so inescapable. But it does so, I suggest, because it is the inevitable corollary of that invention of modernity: accountability.

When we use something to measure a specific objective, it no longer serves its original purpose as an indicator. Through natural behaviour, whether intentional intent or not, people may seek to optimize for said measure. One possible explanation would be [[Target Fixation|target fixation]].

## Chasing a fool's errand

I think it's mentioned in [[Measure What Matters by John Doerr]] about the chasing of OKRs or [[Measure progress using KPIs|KPIs]] can be a fool's errand. It's a way of overfitting - looking to confirm to what we expect our data. It's another form of the Hawthorne effect where being observed makes us conform to expectations rather than acting in an [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|authentic way]].

For example, if one seeks to determine the value of their worth as a person through personal net worth - then this becomes perverted in itself. We may become greedy.

## Overfitting

Can this be thought of as overfitting? When we try to over-optimize a solution where the form becomes obsessive over function?

Sometimes structure needs to emerge naturally - humans are not very good at [[Making decisions for the future can be challenging|long-term planning]]. The world is complex and [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organizing]].
