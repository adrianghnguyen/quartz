## Metaphor of the modern stressors as invisible lions in a nutshell

Back in the olden days, our predecessors had to fight off lions. As such, stress was a way of of creating the proper responses to being chased by a lion.

However, in our modern days, said lions are now invisible - incompetent bosses, dissatisfaction with work, etc. These [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|stressors]] can be [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|identifying stress]].

### Passage from [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski|Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

> Suppose the threat is a lion—the kind of threat we were dealing with in the environment where the mechanism evolved in our early ancestors. The [[Stress response system lifecycle]] notices the lion and shouts, “I’m at risk! What do I do?” A lion, your brain informs you in much less than a second, is the kind of threat that you are most likely to survive by trying to escape.
>
> So what do you do when you see a lion coming after you?
>
> You feel fear, and you run.
>
> And then what happens?
>
> There are only two possible outcomes, right? Either you get killed by the lion, in which case none of the rest of this matters, or you escape and live. So imagine that you successfully run back to your village and scream for help, and everyone helps you slaughter the lion, and then you all eat it for dinner, and in the morning you have a respectful burial service for the parts of the carcass you won’t be using, giving reverent thanks for the lion’s sacrifice.
>
> And how do you feel now?
>
> Relieved! Grateful to be alive! You love your friends and family!
>
> And that is the complete stress response cycle, with beginning (“I’m at risk!”), middle (action), and end (“I’m safe!”).

> Animals in the wild freeze and fall to the ground as a last-ditch effort to convince a predator they’re already dead; Stephen Porges has hypothesized that freeze is a stress response that facilitates a painless death
>
> If an animal survives such an intense threat to its life, then it does an extraordinary thing: It shakes. It trembles, paws vibrating in the air. It heaves a great big sigh. And then it gets up, shakes itself off, and trots away.
>
> What’s happening here is that freeze has interrupted the GO! stress response of [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|fight or flight]], leaving all that adrenaline-mediated stress to go stale inside the animal’s body. When the animal shakes and shudders and sighs, its body is releasing the brake, completing the activation process triggered by fight/flight, and purging the residue. Completing the cycle. It’s called “self-paced termination.”
