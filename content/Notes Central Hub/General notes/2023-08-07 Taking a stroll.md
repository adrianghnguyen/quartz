Related to [[2023-08-07]]

I feel like I am [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotionally suffering]] quite a lot today. I hadn't realized how far down the spiral I had gone - which is apparently something that can be quite difficult at times when we are in a [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination spiral]].

It came to mind when I was [[Social media is a poor cure for boredom|scrolling endlessly through social media]] and realized that I was looking to attenuate my emotional pain through any means as long as I could [[disassociation is tuning out as an adaptive response|tune it out]] and make these feelings go away by [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|dismissing them]]. But I know that's not necessarily healthy.

[[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|Emotional regulation and resilience]] is quite difficult. As a [[High intellectual potential overview|potentially gifted child]], I have the tendency to be [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitive to emotions]] and feel them much  more strongly - [[Neuroticism|neuroticism]].

I think being able to [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|name my feeling]] would be a good first start. At the moment, I feel weak, ignored and…unsure. I think one way to really describe is I feel emotionally fatigued and wish to [[Self-protection and anxiety avoidance|retreat into a cocoon]]. I decided to take the little step of going outside for a walk, since [[REF Unifying Theory of Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|exercise is highly effective for stress management]] and disrupting my current train of thought. I think one way is to say that I'm experiencing much anguish at the moment.

It's something which requires [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|willpower]] and sometimes it's better to [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|just do it]] before my mind changes topic.

If I have to think back closely, it's a continuation of my thoughts of [[2023-08-07 Sleepless at night|2023-08-07 Sleepless at night]].

I think I feel stuck in my feelings with the fact that my life does not seem to be progressing forward…have I moved forward? There's a hint of [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|hopelessness]] behind this feeling. Are things different than before? I do know that poor mental health leads to a multitude of [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions]] and prevents me from looking for the positive things in my life.

Perhaps taking a look at [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|what makes me happy]] is worth seeing and maybe there's [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|an action I can take]] to make myself [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|feel better]].

That's all for today. [[The experience of listening to music|Listening to music]] is helping with my sense of [[Loneliness and its negative impact on health|loneliness]].
