It means you're [[Incremental change|one step closer]] to getting it right. You can also think of them as [[Knowledge is a gift|giving you some knowledge, which can be accepted or discarded based on relevance]].

The [[Feedback loop|faster you can iterate through the feedback]], [[Fixed mindset|the more one can learn to grow as a person]].

## Various types of feedback

> [!ai]+ AI - Three main types of feedback
>
> 1. Outcome Feedback: This type of feedback focuses on the end result or outcome of a task or performance. It provides information about whether the desired goal was achieved or not. For example, in a sports competition, outcome feedback would be given based on the final score, indicating whether the team won or lost.
> 2. Informational Feedback: This type of feedback provides specific information about the quality, process, or execution of a task or performance. It focuses on providing details and constructive criticism to help improve future performance. For example, a teacher giving feedback to a student's essay may provide suggestions on how to improve the organization and clarity of their writing.
> 3. Corrective Feedback: This type of feedback is given in order to correct errors or mistakes in performance. It highlights what went wrong and offers suggestions for improvement. It is often used to address specific areas where improvement is needed. For example, a manager might give corrective feedback to an employee who made a mistake in handling a customer complaint, pointing out what should have been done differently and how to avoid similar mistakes in the future.

Corrective feedback is often the most difficult one to obtain, but also the most valuable. It helps us correct in real time, but requires some one who has a good level of knowledge and instruct us.
