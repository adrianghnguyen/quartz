## Overview of the mesolimbic pathway

> [!question] Also called mesolimbic cortex?
> Within [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]], she refers to it it as the mesolimbic cortex but most literature seems to call it mesolimbic pathway. She refers it to it as the one 'emotional center'

The mesolimbic pathway has multiple roles, such as assessing, planning, and management of [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|approach/avoidance behaviours]].  As a result, since it governs multiple functions,

> In the context of your emotional brain, the One Ring processes all of your emotional/motivational systems, including **[[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stress responses]]** (fear, aggression, and shutdown), disgust, **all forms of pleasure** from physical to artistic, love and [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|social connection]], and of course [[Dual control model of sexual response|sex]]. All these emotions function, all at once, all in the same place: in your emotional One Ring.

It's also involved in multiple aspects of our [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual arousal]], including but not limited to the pleasure aspect. But this can be a bit reductive, like calling it a "vagina" when we mean "vulva". At least that's how it's explained within [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]].

See also [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center]] for further details on how to conceptualize the various functions.

### Reward processing center of the brain

The mesolimbic pathway is involved in processing the rewarding properties of stimuli, such as food, drugs, and social interactions.

When we experience something pleasurable, such as eating a delicious meal or receiving praise, the mesolimbic pathway is activated, releasing dopamine into the [[Nucleus accumbens|nucleus accumbens (NAc)]]. This release of [[dopamine]] is what reinforces behavior and motivates us to seek out similar rewards in the future.

### Emotional processing of the brain

The mesolimbic pathway is also involved in emotional processing, particularly in the context of positive emotions. When we experience something pleasurable, such as winning a game or hearing a favorite song, the mesolimbic pathway is activated, causing a release of dopamine that contributes to the feelings of happiness and pleasure associated with the experience.

### Motivation processing center of the brain

The mesolimbic pathway is also involved in motivation, particularly in the context of goal-directed behavior. When we have a goal, such as obtaining a reward, the mesolimbic pathway is activated, driving us to take actions that will help us achieve that goal.

Is it related to [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|approach and avoidance behaviour]]?

## Role of the mesolimbic pathway within the brain

Mesolimbic pathway, which is a neural pathway in the brain that plays a critical role in the processing of reward and motivation.

Activation of the mesolimbic pathway can occur in response to various stimuli, including food, drugs, and social interaction. The release of dopamine in response to these stimuli reinforces the behavior and motivates the individual to seek out similar experiences in the future.

### Why is the mesolimbic pathway important

The mesolimbic pathway has been implicated in various disorders, including addiction, [[Depression|depression]], and schizophrenia. Dysfunction of the pathway can lead to alterations in reward processing, [[Theories of creativity and motivation|motivation]], and [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]]. Therefore, understanding the mesolimbic pathway and its function is important for understanding the underlying mechanisms of these disorders and developing effective treatments.

## Composition of the mesolimbic pathway

The mesolimbic pathway is composed of neurons that originate in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain and project to several areas of the [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]], including the [[Nucleus accumbens|nucleus accumbens]], amygdala, and prefrontal cortex. The pathway is responsible for the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is involved in the experience of pleasure and reward.
