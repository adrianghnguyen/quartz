# System 2 or explicit reasoning takes time to kick in

#status/done

Related to [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning]] which explains how our brains sometimes make quick heuristic decisions using [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] or uses higher level functions aka deliberate thinking. It helps us engage in [[Analytical thinking is first-principles based|analytical thinking]].

> System 2: This is the slow, deliberate, and analytical system that operates consciously and requires effort. It's responsible for our reasoning, logic, and problem-solving abilities, and it helps us to make complex decisions and engage in critical thinking.

> System 2 is evolutionarily recent and speculated as specific to humans. It is also known as the _explicit_ system, the _rule-based_ system, the _rational_ system,[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#cite_note-Evans-14) or the _analytic_ system.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#cite_note-Tsujii-19) It performs the more slow and sequential thinking. It is domain-general, performed in the central working memory system. Because of this, it has a limited capacity and is slower than System 1 which correlates it with general intelligence. It is known as the rational system because it reasons according to logical standards.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#cite_note-Tsujii-19) Some overall properties associated with System 2 are that it is rule-based, analytic, controlled, demanding of cognitive capacity, and slow.

> Daniel Kahneman provided further interpretation by differentiating the two styles of processing more, calling them intuition and reasoning in 2003. Intuition (or system 1), similar to associative reasoning, was determined to be fast and automatic, usually with strong emotional bonds included in the reasoning process. Kahneman said that this kind of reasoning was based on formed habits and very difficult to change or manipulate. Reasoning (or system 2) was slower and much more volatile, being subject to conscious judgments and attitudes.^[Wikipedia Dual Process Theory]
