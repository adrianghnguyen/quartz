## What is the theory of basic human values?

> The Theory of Basic Human Values is a theory of cross-cultural psychology and universal values that was developed by Shalom H. Schwartz. The theory extends previous cross-cultural communication frameworks such as Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory. Schwartz identifies ten basic human values, each distinguished by their underlying motivation or goal, and he explains how people in all cultures recognize them. There are two major methods for measuring these ten basic values:

## Third-order structural model of the theory of basic human values

This is the most up to date version of the model coming out in 2012.^[Schwartz, S. H., Cieciuch, J., Vecchione, M., Davidov, E., Fischer, R., Beierlein, C., … & Konty, M. (2012). Refining the theory of basic individual values. Journal of personality and social psychology, 103(4), 663.]

- There are 19 motivational domains
- Values on the opposing spectrums are polarities and may be in tension
- Those in adjacent domains are related while non-adjacent represent opposing domains
- We need to recognize that there are continuums of motivations rather than discrete entities.^["The circular arrangement of values represents a continuum of related motivations, like the circular continuum of colors, rather than a set of discrete motivations." (Davidov, Schmidt, & Schwartz, 2008, p. 424)]
- The other of the values represent the conflict/compatibility between people leading to polarities
	- Personal vs social focuses
	- Search for self-enhancement and [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] vs. search for self-protection and extrinsic motivation

> In a third stage, [Schwartz et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018372773#bib31) posited a total of nineteen motivational domains, as opposed to the seven and ten of prior versions. [Schwartz et al. (2012)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018372773#bib31) differentiated between three types of universalism (concern, nature and tolerance), two types of benevolence (caring and dependability), two types of self-direction (thought and action), two types of conformity (rules and interpersonal), two types of power (dominance and resources) and two types of security (personal and societal). Also, they introduced two new basic values: humility and face (or appearance). These nineteen domains again fit within a circular model ([Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018372773#fig3)), in which adjacent domains are related and those that are non-adjacent represent opposing domains. Additionally, the values’ order was based on the conflict or compatibility between them for people, giving [rise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/clotiazepam "Learn more about rise from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to two polarities: one between the personal and social focuses, and the other between the search for self-enhancement and intrinsic motivations, and the search for self-protection and extrinsic motivations.^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844018372773#bib31]

> Shalom Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values is one of the most commonly used and tested transcultural theories in the field of behavioural research. This theory has been refined since the 1980s to reach its most recent version, from 2012. The underlying reason for this theory's continuous evolution is that it assumes that values form a circular motivational continuum, meaning that the items do not have exact limits between the values and thus have a shared load on more than one, giving [rise](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/nursing-and-health-professions/clotiazepam "Learn more about rise from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") to [multicollinearity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/multicollinearity "Learn more about multicollinearity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Additionally, measuring as they do different aspects, each value is multidimensional, thereby reducing internal consistency coefficients. The refined version represents an attempt to reduce or even eliminate these problems.

## Personal commentary on theory of basic human values

I find it interesting that being able to leave our ego behind.  The value in being conservative is to learn how to protect yourself. However, Humans are prone to being anxious and fear danger which might prevent us from growing. I think the important key is to determine balance and know when there is actual danger versus when there simply anxiety.

The tricky part is that anxiety is actually a valuable feeling. It tells us that there might be potential dangers, and we have to learn how to balance this properly. Negative feelings indicate potential threats. Take into an extreme, though it and it is no longer valuable. They would be interesting to find the research on how likely are people to go on the risk reward curves.

For example, one of the precursors to flow states is risk taking. And in order to take risks, need to leave anxiety behind. Or at least embrace it fully.

What is the value in hedonism though? Having watched a video on the other day about how being liberal or being on the left means fighting for progress, It's interesting to think about conservative power structures. Conserve power structures promote stagnancy - but perhaps that's a value judgement in itself. To be fair, being progressive does not mean implementing every single idea. It is simply to recognize that things can be better. The quote which stands out to me is that, to criticize, is to show the ability to improve.

## Self-protection and anxiety avoidance

### Power structures stagnate into conservative viewpoints

The video below soft to explain how, what is eventually progressive, eventually turns into natural structures, which is the right. As things become accepted, they simply become the status quo. If we believe that humans should be pursuing self-growth, then why shouldn't our power structures not follow the same pattern?

## Refining the theory of basic individual values

---

We propose a refined theory of basic individual values intended to provide greater heuristic and explanatory power than the original theory of 10 values (Schwartz, 1992). The refined theory more accurately expresses the central assumption of the original theory that research has largely ignored: Values form a circular motivational continuum. The theory defines and orders 19 values on the continuum based on their compatible and conflicting motivations, expression of self-protection versus growth, and personal versus social focus. We assess the theory with a new instrument in 15 samples from 10 countries (N = 6,059). Confirmatory factor and multidimensional scaling analyses support discrimination of the 19 values, confirming the refined theory. Multidimensional scaling analyses largely support the predicted motivational order of the values. Analyses of predictive validity demonstrate that the refined values theory provides greater and more precise insight into the value underpinnings of beliefs. Each value correlates uniquely with external variables. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)
