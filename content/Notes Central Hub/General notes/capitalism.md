## What is capitalism?

> [!ai] AI
> Capitalism is an economic system in which private individuals, rather than the government, own and control the means of production and distribution of goods and services. In a capitalist system, the goal is to maximize profits, and prices are determined by supply and demand.
>
> Competition among businesses drives innovation, efficiency, and productivity. Capitalism is often associated with individual freedoms and the ability to accumulate wealth through private enterprise. However, critics argue that it can lead to income inequality, exploitation of workers, and environmental degradation.

## Capitalism rewards the pursuit of maximal growth and profit-chasing

> Capitalism rewards the pursuit of maximal growth for a number of reasons, which are rooted in the foundational [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|principles]] and characteristics of the economic system itself.
>
> Here are some key factors:
>
> 1.  Profit motive: At its core, capitalism is driven by the pursuit of profit. Businesses aim to maximize their profits, which often entails expanding their operations and increasing market share. This growth can lead to increased wealth for shareholders, higher wages for employees, and more opportunities for investment.
> 2.  Competition: Capitalism is characterized by competition, as businesses constantly strive to outperform one another. This competitive [[Personality is shaped our environment|environment]] incentivizes companies to grow, innovate, and increase efficiency, as they seek to maintain or gain market share.
> 3.  [[Economies of scale]]: As businesses expand, they can achieve [[economies of scale]], which refers to the cost advantages that come from producing goods or services on a larger scale. This can lead to lower costs per unit, which in turn can lead to higher profit margins.
> 4.  Consumer preferences: Consumers generally prefer to purchase goods and services at the lowest possible prices, and in many cases, larger companies can offer lower prices due to [[economies of scale]]. This demand from consumers can fuel the pursuit of growth, as businesses aim to become more competitive and attract more customers.
> 5.  Access to capital: Larger, more successful companies often have better access to capital markets, allowing them to raise funds for further growth and investment. This can create a [[Feedback loop|positive feedback loop]], as growth begets more growth.
> 6.  Innovation and technological advancement: The pursuit of maximal growth can lead to [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|innovation]] and the development of new technologies, as companies seek to create new products and services, improve efficiency, or enter new markets. These innovations can drive further growth, leading to even more rewards under a capitalist system.
>
> It's important to note that while capitalism can reward the pursuit of maximal growth, it can also lead to negative consequences, such as income inequality, environmental degradation, and market failures. As a result, there is ongoing debate about the merits of capitalism and the need for government intervention to address its potential drawbacks.

## Arguments against capitalism

### Is capitalism selfish?

> Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production, voluntary exchange, and the profit motive. Whether or not it is inherently selfish depends on one's [[Brains are biased by nature|perspective]] and interpretation of these principles. Here are two contrasting perspectives:
>
> 1.  Capitalism can be seen as inherently selfish:
> -   Profit motive: Capitalism is driven by the pursuit of profit. Business owners seek to maximize their profits, which can lead some to prioritize their own interests over those of their employees, consumers, or the environment.
> -   Competition: Capitalism encourages competition between businesses, which can lead to a focus on self-interest and a disregard for the well-being of others in the quest to outperform rivals and gain market share.
> -   Income inequality: Capitalism can lead to significant income inequality, with wealth becoming concentrated in the hands of a few. This can be seen as selfish, as the system allows some individuals to accumulate vast amounts of wealth while others struggle to make ends meet.
>
> 2.  Capitalism can be seen as not inherently selfish:
> -   Voluntary exchange: Capitalism is built on the principle of voluntary exchange, where individuals and businesses freely engage in transactions that they believe will benefit them. This can foster cooperation and mutual benefit, as people work together to achieve their goals.
> -   Wealth creation: Capitalism has been a powerful engine for wealth creation and economic growth, lifting millions of people out of poverty. By incentivizing innovation and efficiency, the system has enabled the development of new technologies and industries that have improved living standards for many.
> -   Corporate social responsibility: Many businesses today recognize the importance of balancing profit with social and environmental concerns, and engage in corporate social responsibility initiatives. These actions demonstrate that capitalism doesn't have to be inherently selfish, and that businesses can operate ethically and responsibly within the framework of the system.
>
> In conclusion, whether capitalism is inherently selfish depends on one's perspective and interpretation of its principles. The system has both proponents and critics, with some viewing it as a driver of prosperity and innovation, while others see it as a source of inequality and exploitation. It is important to recognize that the outcomes of capitalism can be shaped by factors such as government policies, social norms, and individual choices.

Several economic and social systems aim to reward altruistic factors and discourage selfish or self-preserving behaviors. Some examples of these systems, along with their key design motivators and safeguards, are:
