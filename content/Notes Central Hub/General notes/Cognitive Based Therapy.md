## Cognitive based therapy

The focus of this approach of therapy is to understand and **recognize the meaning** which we've personally assigned the trauma and then *challenging belief patterns* **within said meaning**. It also seeks to recognize the behavioral habits which we've learned as trauma responses and how we can learn to challenge those patterns.

Here are the general steps:

1. Identify the pattern or thought ([[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart]])
2. Develop skills to replace the patterns with new habits
3. [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|Feel the feels]] to [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|complete the stress response cycle]]
4. Begin practicing the new patterns of behaviours instead of engaging in old habitual [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|self-defensive patterns]] 
5. 
Through this process, the residual trauma will emerge but it's important to understand that we are in a safe setting and the context has changed.
