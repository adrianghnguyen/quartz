# Acquisition centrality is mistakenly believing that materialism leads to happiness

Related to [[Module 5 Worldly Rewards]]

> Acquisition centrality is the idea people are motivated, whether it consciously or subconsciously, to acquire money and material possessions as indicators of success and as functional steps towards achieving happiness.

Based on academic research on personal well-being and material possessions, materialism is not a path towards happiness.^[Dittmar, Helga, et al. "The relationship between materialism and personal well-being: A meta-analysis." Journal of personality and social psychology 107.5 (2014): 879.]

We should understand that [[Spend money on other people and valuable causes to increase happiness|spending money on others is a a better way  to increase our happiness]] rather than hoarding it or being part of the [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|hedonic treadmill]].

Many of these things are due to our [[Cultural roots of shame|cultural messages]] and personal upbringings - whether intentional or not.

## Materialism most likely lowers happiness

Placing value on acquiring money and possessions is called materialism.

> Researchers have discovered that materialism has varied negative effects on our well-being. In 2014, researchers at the University of Sussex in the UK collected over 150 studies into a meta-analysis and found that there is no evidence of positive associations between materialism and well-being, regardless of culture, age, sex, or social status. In fact, most studies show a negative effect on well-being from materialism depending on how much value was placed on acquiring money and possessions. From all these studies, the message is clear:Â _materialism cannot raise your happiness, and probably lowers it._
