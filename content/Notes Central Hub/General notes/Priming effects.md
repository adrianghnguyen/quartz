# Priming effect

## Reflections

> _Priming_, or, the _Priming Effect,_ occurs when an individual’s exposure to a certain stimulus influences his or her response to a subsequent stimulus, without any awareness of the connection. These stimuli are often related to words or images that people see during their day-to-day lives.

As a result of the mechanisms of semantic priming, it's important to be selective in how we choose our words. For example, when suggesting to someone a course of action, your word choice can have a great impact on their cognitive interpretations.

"You should do this?" will trigger authoritative schemas versus "Have you considered this?" might promote someone to use

their logical reasoning instead.

It has a big impact on how we retrieve information ([[Memory is processed information]]) as it begins stimulating thoughts.

> ### Why the priming effect happens
>
> Psychologists have found that units—also referred to as schemas—of information are stored in our [[long-term memory]]^[Cherry, K. (2020). How Priming Affects the Psychology of Memory. https://www.verywellmind.com/priming-and-the-psychology-of-memory-4173092.]. These schemas can be activated by sights, smells, and sounds. When these schemas are activated, our memories become easier to access. Priming suggests that certain schemas are activated in unison, which in turn leads related or connected units of information to be activated at the same time. Once related schemas are activated and more accessible, it becomes easier for us to draw related information into memory more quickly, and we can thus respond faster when the need arises. For example, the schemas related to rainstorms and slick roads may be linked in our memories. As a result, when we drive and it is raining, the memory of slick roads comes to mind, leading us to slow down and take precaution.

> ### The types of priming effects
>
> ##### Positive and negative priming
>
> This form of priming influences our processing speeds. **Positive priming** makes us process information faster and reduces the time required for memory retrieval. **Negative priming**, on the other hand, slows down information processing in our minds.
>
> ##### Semantic priming - why wording matters
>
> Semantic priming occurs when we associate words in a logical or linguistic way. The early example of the connection between doctor and nurse provides an explanation for this form of priming.
>
> ##### Repetition priming
>
> This variation of priming occurs when a stimulus and response are paired repeatedly. Due to pairing, we become more likely to act or think a specific way each time the stimulus appears.
>
> ##### Perceptual priming
>
> Perceptual priming takes place when stimuli have similar forms. For example, the word ‘goat’ will provoke a fast response when it is near the word ‘boat’ because the two words are perceptually similar.^[https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/priming]
