This is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|conceptual model]] to help understand how trauma manifests itself in the body and impacts our somatic sensory experiences. Connect to findings from [[The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel A Van der Kolk|The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel A Van Der Kolk]] as this is more current information.

> Although the manifestation of trauma in the body is a phenomenon well-endorsed by clinicians and traumatized individuals, the neurobiological underpinnings of this manifestation remain unclear.
>
> The notion of somatic sensory processing, which encompasses vestibular and somatosensory processing and relates to the sensory systems concerned with how the physical body exists in and relates to physical space, is introduced as a major contributor to overall regulatory, social-emotional, and self-referential functioning.
>
> From a phylogenetically and ontogenetically informed perspective, trauma-related symptomology is conceptualized to be grounded in brainstem-level somatic sensory processing dysfunction and its cascading influences on physiological arousal modulation, affect regulation, and higher-order capacities.
>
> Lastly, we introduce a novel hierarchical model bridging somatic sensory processes with limbic and neocortical mechanisms regulating an individualâ€™s emotional experience and sense of a relational, agentive self. This model provides a working framework for the neurobiologically informed assessment and treatment of trauma-related conditions from a somatic sensory processing perspective.

> This article is about how trauma can affect the body and the brain. It explores the idea that our senses and how we perceive our physical body in space are important for our overall well-being. The article suggests that problems with these sensory processes, which start in the brainstem, can lead to difficulties in regulating our emotions and other higher-level functions. The article also introduces a new model that connects these sensory processes with other parts of the brain responsible for our emotional experiences and sense of self. This model could be useful for assessing and treating trauma-related conditions from a sensory perspective.

> - Individuals who have experienced trauma may develop a disconnect between their brain and body, leading to physical symptoms and an increased risk for trauma-related disorders.
> - The somatic sensory system, which includes the nerves and receptors that transmit sensory information throughout the body, may play a key role in trauma-related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
> - [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|]] can lead to changes in the somatic sensory system that disrupt the body's ability to process and regulate sensory information, resulting in physical symptoms such as [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|pain]], gastrointestinal distress, and numbness or tingling.
> - Somatic sensory interventions, such as mindfulness-based interventions, yoga, and body-centered therapies, may be effective in treating trauma-related disorders by addressing the somatic sensory changes that occur as a result of trauma.
> - Interdisciplinary approaches that address both the physical and psychological aspects of trauma are important for promoting healing and recovery.
> - A better understanding of the somatic sensory system and its role in trauma-related disorders may lead to more effective treatments and interventions for individuals who have experienced trauma.

This text discusses the relationship between the body and the brain in the context of trauma-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It highlights how alterations in the neural pathways involved in somatic sensory processing can lead to persistent sensory and emotional overwhelm. These alterations can result in symptoms such as hyper- or hypo-responsivity to sensory input, as well as derealization and depersonalization. The text also explores the impact of trauma on the integration of sensory information and the sense of self. Overall, it provides a neurobiological perspective on how somatic sensory processing contributes to trauma-related symptoms.

This would help explain the possible hypersensitivity theories associated with [[Neuroticism|neuroticism]] and possibly be linked to mechanisms of [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitivity in gifted children]].
