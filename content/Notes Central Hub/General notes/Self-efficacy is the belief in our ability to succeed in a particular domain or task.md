# Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task

#status/done

- Related to [[Self-perception refers to the way individuals perceive and interpret themselves]]

## Self efficacy is the belief that we can achieve specific outcomes

> Self-efficacy refers to **an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments** (Bandura, 1977, 1986, 1997). Self-efficacy reflects confidence in the ability to exert control over one's own motivation, behavior, and social environment.^[https://www.apa.org/pi/aids/resources/education/self-efficacy#:~:text=Self%2Defficacy%20refers%20to%20an,%2C%20behavior%2C%20and%20social%20environment.]

It is our belief that we have the **ability** to achieve specific outcomes and is closely tied with [[Self-confidence|self-confidence]]. It is the opposite of learned helplessness. If I don't know something - okay I'll go figure out how to achieve it. It's related to the [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]] in a specific domain.^[https://www.excelatlife.com/articles/selfesteem.htm] It is the belief that one has the necessary skills, knowledge, and resources to achieve desired outcomes.

Self-efficacy is strongly linked to motivation and performance as individuals with high levels of self-efficacy are more likely to set challenging goals, exert effort, and persevere in the face of obstacles. They have a strong sense of [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]].

That's why [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|expertise]] can be so fulfilling. After all, [[Humans are motivated to grow|humans are motivated to grow]].

## How to increase your sense of self-efficacy

- [[My core values define what matters|Pursue mastery]] and [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|becoming an expert]]
- *Vicarious experiences of social models* aka '**[[Growth mindset|Seeing someone who similar succeeding at something which we believe was difficult]]**'
- Belief in success and having [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-esteem]]

### Belief in our own capacity to succeed enhances our self-image

**Believing that one has the ability to succeed** enhances/affects your self-efficacy aka your self-image in that aspect. Those who believe that they have the ability to accomplish a task are more likely to keep being persistent at accomplishing it. This also lowers our self-doubt.

As someone in the [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|support network]] of the person, try and place them in opportunities where success is possible. Placing someone in a situation that is too challenging, or outside of their reach will undermine self-efficacy^[Bandura, Albert (2010), "Self-Efficacy", The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology, American Cancer Society, pp. 1–3, doi:10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0836, ISBN 978-0-470-47921-6, retrieved 2021-03-20]

Sounds similar to how we cannot enter [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow state]] if the challenge is too high. Needs to be the right balance.

## What are the characteristics of self efficacy?

Source: [The Pillars of the Self-Concept: Self-Esteem and Self-Efficacy](https://www.excelatlife.com/articles/selfesteem.htm)

How can we tell if someone has high self-efficacy?

- They are people who are [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|confident in themselves]].
- They are able to evaluate themselves accurately - this can be difficult at times when we are struggling with our self-image due to our mental health as a result of [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions]]
- They are willing to take risks by [[Curiosity as my worldview|trying new things]]
- They have a high sense of accomplishment, viewing [[View challenges as opportunities|making mistakes as opportunities to learn and improve]]

### 1) **Self-confidence.**

One of the most obvious characteristics of high self-efficacy is self-confidence. They approach tasks or situations with a sense of their ability to be successful. This self-confidence tends to lead to more experience which increases their ability which leads to greater self-confidence. This positive cycle lends itself to increasing self-efficacy even further.

See [[Feedback loop]]

### 2) Accurate self-evaluation

Individuals with high self-efficacy tend to be able to accurately evaluate their performance. They are neither overly-critical nor overly positive but are able to examine themselves realistically in order to pursue self-improvement.

See [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]]

### 3) Willingness To take risks

Those with high self-efficacy are willing to take risks because they understand that taking calculated risks increases the chances of success. As they are not fearful of failure or mistakes, reasonable risks can only increase self-efficacy.

See [[Curiosity as my worldview]]

### 4) Sense of accomplishment

Generally those with high self-efficacy feel a sense of accomplishment because they are often more successful due to the willingness to take risk and to pursue interests. Even if they fail or make mistakes they feel a sense of accomplishment because they view mistakes as opportunities to improve themselves.

See [[View challenges as opportunities]].
