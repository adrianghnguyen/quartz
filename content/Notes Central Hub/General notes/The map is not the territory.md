Simplified model of how things actually work which is only a helpful [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] of how things work until stuff gets more complicated where we need to apply another more complicated model.

This is to get the knowledge framework ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) in place so we can even understand the complexities, similar to the black box method of thinking ([[Black Box method]]).

> In general, when modeling phenomena in science and engineering, we begin with simplified, incomplete models. As we examine things in greater detail, these simple models become inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. The [[Substitution model in computer science|substitution model]] is no exception.^[https://sarabander.github.io/sicp/html/1_002e1.xhtml#g_t1_002e1]

## 'good enough' for decision-making

NASA when performing calculations uses the value of pi at 3.141592653589793 with 15 digits of precision in order to do their calculations^[https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need/]. The key is to realize when we have enough information and expending resources to ensure additional information gain no longer has a benefit. We can also relate this to the [[Pareto principle]] on the efficient use of our mental power.

The concept of mental models needing to be good enough approximation is also discussed more widely within [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]]. I'll need to add in notes concerning this.

The only times we should think of slowing down to gain additional information ([[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.]]) is when there is something which is life-threatening or critically important to our life goals or values. It's important to establish a cut off of when we should [[Make quick and decisive actions|move into action]] ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]]) rather than succumbing to [[analysis paralysis]].
