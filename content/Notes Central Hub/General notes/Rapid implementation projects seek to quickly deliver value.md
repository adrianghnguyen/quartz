# Rapid implementation projects seek to quickly deliver value

Related to [[REF Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver]]

Cities across Canada and the world have shifted to delivering bikeways using "rapid implementation" projects (RIP) or a "quick build" approach. Its aim is to build safe and [[Levels of traffic stress for cyclists|comfortable cycling infrastructure]] by delivering value in faster cycles and at lower costs than traditional planning approaches. It also requires less bureaucracy, procedures, and topographic surveys as a result of its 'light' construction nature.

This seems to me like agile methodology by implementing [[Minimum viable products|minimum viable products (MVP)]]  as applied to biking or generalized infrastructure. If the rapid implementation proves successful, the government should begin seeing if there is desire from its constituents to make a permanent project/design solution.

The key pillars of this design philosophy are the following:
1. Fast -> Implemented in timelines of months or less
2. Low cost -> User of lower cost materials and occur within available space than additional capital construction
3. Flexible -> Recognizes that proposed solutions will need to be [[Continuous feedback leads to change|continuous feedback loops]]

Do note that this not mean that rapid implementation is inherently 'cheap'.

## Rapid implementation process in a nutshell

![[Pasted image 20230413224321.png]]

## Key design features in rapid implementation projects

1. Implemented within curb to curb width aka re-allocating existing space
2. Use adaptable and relatively low cost materials in order to do rapid iterations
3. Shorter timelines within days to months rather than years
4. Easily modified throughout its lifespan
5. Incorporates aesthetic designs in order to bring liveliness to the infrastructure - they refer to this as placemaking elements. I guess it means that the place should be inviting and 'delighting the user' similar to [[User experience design|UX design]]

## Reasons for rapid implementation

- Promotes community engagement by integrating their inputs and making the community feel heard as part of the process - taking their status of stakeholder into account
- With its faster implementation approach, it helps us take urgent action on climate change.
- Improving [[Modal share aka percentage of transportation usage|modal shares]] of  low-emissions transportation options rapidly
- Improve road safety by reducing the amounts of cars on the road by increasing the [[Modal share aka percentage of transportation usage|share of trips]] made by car alternatives
- Improve public health through [[active transportation has multiple benefits|active transportation]]
- Economically competitive and cost-competitive in restricted economic resources for local governments - they need to do more with less which can hamper positive progress on infrastructure projects.
- Getting over the chicken or egg problem by getting the infrastructure rolling in terms of network formation
- Can help convert [[Minimum viable products|proof of concept projects]] into semi-permanent structures such as the case with the Beach Avenue Safety and Design Upgrades helping exceeding over 10, 000 trips per day^[TransitLink.

I truly believe that if we can envision the possibilities, we can dream of a better future. I'm an [[Optimism is needed for long-term success|optimist]] - we just have to see what's possible here today and eke out small victories.
