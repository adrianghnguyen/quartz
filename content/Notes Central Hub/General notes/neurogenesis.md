# Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons

#status/done

While most neurons are already present at birth, there is evidence supporting the notion that neurogenesis continues throughout life.

Neuroscientists have differing opinions on the frequency and quantity of new neurons formed in the brain.

> Many neuroscientists disagree about how many and how often new neurons are created in the brain. Most of the brain’s neurons are already created by the time we’re born, but there is evidence to support the theory that [neurogenesis](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-life-and-death-neuron#neurogenesis) is a lifelong process.
>
> Neurons are born in areas of the brain that are full of neural stem cells, or precursor cells. Stem cells have the potential to make most, if not all, of the different types of neurons and glia found in the brain.
>
> Neuroscientists have observed how neural stem cells behave during experiments in the laboratory. Although this may not be exactly how these cells act when they’re in the brain, it gives us information about how they might function when they’re in the brains of humans or other animals.
>
> The science of stem cells is still very new and could change with additional discoveries, but researchers have learned enough to be able to describe how neural stem cells create the other cells of the brain. The way that stem cells can become other types of brain cells is similar to the idea of a family tree.

> Neural stem cells increase by dividing in two. Then they can become either two new stem cells, or two early progenitor cells (parent cells to new neurons or glia), or one of each.
>
> When a stem cell divides to produce another stem cell, it is said to self-renew. This new cell has the potential to make more stem cells.
>
> When a stem cell divides to produce an early progenitor cell, it is said to diﬀerentiate. Diﬀerentiation means that the new cell is more specialized in how it’s formed and what it can do.
>
> Early progenitor cells can make other progenitor cells, self-renew like stem cells, or can change in either of two ways. One way will make new astrocytes. The other way will make neurons or oligodendrocytes.

In the 1980s, scientists began discovering that it is possible to grow further neurons, even in later stages of life such as adulthood. It was common evidence that children were able to grow new neural circuitry at age, but we believe that it was fixed with age.

This would be evidence that the [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]] is wired within our brain - we are not inherently limited and are product of [[Continuous process and cycles|constant self-evolving cycles]].

This would explain that [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplasticity]] can occur even in later stages of life - as long as we choose to keep learning.

## Evidence of neurogenesis was observed in bird mating seasons

Birds generated new neural circuits during mating seasons demonstrating neurogenesis,

> Fortunately, in the early 1980s, a scientist trying to understand how birds learn to sing began to see how neurogenesis in the adult brain might make sense. In a series of experiments, Fernando Nottebohm and his research team showed that the numbers of neurons in the forebrains (areas controlling complex behaviors) of male canaries dramatically increased during the mating season, when the birds learn new songs to attract females.
>
> Why did these bird brains add neurons at such an important time in learning? Nottebohm believed it was because newborn neurons helped store new song patterns within the pathways of the forebrain; these new neurons made learning new songs possible! If birds made new neurons to help them remember and learn, Nottebohm thought the brains of mammals—like humans—might too.

When scientists research bird mating patterns, they were able to discover that the ability to generate new neural circuits can be observed in nature.
