## Perception can influence our mood

The same sensation under difference contexts will lead to different perceptions.^[Aubrey, “Feeling a Little Blue.”] Mood would be one of the driving factors behind one's perception. How we perceive something is affected by our current state of mind, such as stress levels, pleasure, etc. It's the organization identification and partition of sensory information in order to understand said information. It's a combination of physical stimuli processing but also what has occurred cognitively (such as memories, expectation, attention).

Written as a formula, perception can be represented as the following:

$perception=sensation+context$

Within [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]], she uses the example of tickling. If we're in a bad mood, tickling may enrage us but if we are in love, in an intimate moment it will be perceived as playful. This would extend to all our senses like taste - which may be a reason why [[Depression|depression]] makes the world feel and taste grey.

See also [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center]] to understand the expectation system.

## Basic human senses

- Thermoreception: Ability to feel temperature and heat differences
- Equilibrioception: Sense of balance
- Nociception: Sense of pain
- Chronoception: Sense of time which is affected by our sense of [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow]]

Are there others I'm missing?

## Perception can cause physiological effects

If we spend extended time on a cruise, our brains would re-learn perception of movement and feel as if we are wobbly even after our return to land as related to **equilibrioception**.

Those who have experienced severe [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|pain]] in the past develop future higher pain tolerance.^[Ariely, D., & Jones, S. (2008). Predictably irrational (pp. 278-9). New York: HarperCollins.]

This also applies to [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|sexual stimuli]], within the [[Dual control model of sexual response|dual control model]].

## Perception of emotional safety affects sexual desire

In [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]], she explains that there's mounting evidence that [[Context affects midbrain response to stimuli|context can affect how our brains respond to stimuli]]. For example, with the [[REF Emotional environments retune the valence of appetitive versus fearful functions in nucleus accumbens|rat experiment]], it's been demonstrated that emotional context affects our [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|approach and avoidance behaviours]] within the [[Dual control model of sexual response|dual control model of sexual response]].

> “Context changes how your brain responds to sex,” doesn’t just mean, “Set the mood,” like with candles, corsets, and a locked bedroom door. It also means that when you’re in a great sex-positive context, almost everything can activate your [[Curiosity as my worldview|curious]] “What’s this?” desirous approach to sex. And when you’re in a not-so-great context—either external circumstances or internal brain state—it doesn’t matter how sexy your partner is, how much you love them, or how fancy your underwear is, almost nothing will activate that curious, appreciative, desirous experience.
