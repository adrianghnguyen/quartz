# Third places allow communities to gather and develop

The “third place” is a term coined by US sociologist Ray Oldenburg in his 1989 book [_The Great Good Place_](https://amzn.to/2ZQylZt)_._ It describes a place outside your home or work where you can relax and hang out.

1. Your **first place** is your home, a private and domestic space.
2. Your **second** place is your work, a structured social experience and where you likely spend most of your time.
3. A **third** place is an anchor of the community and usually a public setting that hosts frequent and informal gatherings of people.

Most people are loyal to their third place and return regularly to unwind and socialize. It’s best if it’s located close to your home or work.

Examples of third places:
- Public spaces
	- Local parks, skate parks
	- Café, bars and libraries
	- Places which offer workshops such as universities
- Clubs (maybe the cycling one?)
- Community centers
- A location which *encourages* social activities and conversations
	- Gyms or local cafes tend to be places where people are solitary or don't necessarily wish to engage in social bonding

For me personally, maybe it's the biking club, or Santropol Roulant, a volunteering place.

## Third places allow people to develop identity outside of the work and home

A third place allows us to **[[The need to belong is the root of social connection|restore social connection]]** , give us an [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|identity outside of the home and work]], [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|creates a supportive network such as friends]] and allows us to be our [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|genuine self]]. It is a place which can give us a [[Sense of Place|sense of place]].

If you’ve noticed yourself feeling [[The philosophical source of boredom|bored]], withdrawn, [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|lacking purpose]], or you just [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|feel like your life is off track]], try seeking out a third place.

From easing [[Loneliness and Isolation]] and [[Make more friends by expanding our network of friendships|building friendships]], to adding color to our lives, a third place holds the answer to almost every struggle we face.

[[Loneliness is a widespread epidemic]]

## Virtual worlds can behave as third places

With the prevalence of technology, there' been a shift in the rise of virtual third places due to their similarity to physical places. Online multiplayer games, communication platforms such as Discord allow people to develop new social connections virtually.

## Traits of the third place

	- You are not obligated to be there
	- In the first and second place, there are time commitments and they need to be structured

## Finding a meaningful third place

This will differ from person to person due to individual differences and needs. It's about finding a place which allows us to be our [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|authentic self]].
