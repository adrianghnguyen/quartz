> Fixed mindset is the belief that our abilities and intelligence are fixed traits that cannot be changed, while growth mindset is the belief that our abilities and intelligence can be developed through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate effort]], continuous learning, and perseverance.

Do you believe that intelligence is something we are born with or someone which can be learned and is malleable through [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|our growth and personal development]]? To be fair, [[Intelligence as a concept|Intelligence is still ill-defined and poorly understood as a concept.]]

The following theories of entity and incrementalism are the **formal scientific definitions** of fixed vs [[Growth mindset|growth mindset]].

There's little evidence to show that we cannot keep learning new things as explained by the phenomena of [[Neurogenesis|neurogenesis]] and [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplasticity]]. This applies to trauma, skills and abilities. 

## Competing theories about baseline intelligence levels

> Many studies carried out in the academic area show that students who hold an entity theory of intelligence (ie they consider intelligence like a stable quality) have a strong tendency to attribute their failures to a fixed trait. They are more likely to blame their intelligence for negative outcomes and to attribute failures to their bad intellectual ability.
>
> In contrast, students who hold an incremental theory of intelligence (i.e, they consider intelligence as a malleable quality) are more likely to understand the same negative outcomes in terms of specific factors: they attribute them to a lack of effort.
>
> This differential emphasis on traits versus specific mediators in turn fosters different reactions to negative events.^[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15627050/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20an%20entity%20theory%20of,underlying%20intelligence%20remains%20the%20same.]

I wonder how this plays out with [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] and if we have poor [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] or a low level of [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]]. Wouldn't this be evidence of the [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|as if principle]] as applied to intelligence?

### Entity theory of intelligence states that intelligence levels are fixed at birth

> Entity theory of intelligence isÂ **the belief that intelligence is a fixed trait, a personal quality that cannot be changed**. Students who subscribe to this theory believe that although people can learn new things, their underlying intelligence remains the same.^[[[Role of the implicit theories of intelligence in learning situations] - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15627050/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20an%20entity%20theory%20of,underlying%20intelligence%20remains%20the%20same.)]

I think the question becomes, [[Intelligence as a concept|how do we define intelligence]]? Often times, it's searching for the elusive [[General Intelligence Factor|General intelligence factor (g)]].

### Incremental theory of intelligence explains that intelligence can be developed through efforts and experience

> Incremental theory of intelligence is the belief that intelligence is a malleable quality that can increase through efforts. The identification of these two theories allows us to understand the cognition and behavior of individuals in achievement situations.^[[[Role of the implicit theories of intelligence in learning situations] - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15627050/#:~:text=Thus%2C%20an%20entity%20theory%20of,underlying%20intelligence%20remains%20the%20same.)]

See also [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|high intellectual potential]] to understand the nuance or a branch of this facet. It would also explain some aspects of [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]].
