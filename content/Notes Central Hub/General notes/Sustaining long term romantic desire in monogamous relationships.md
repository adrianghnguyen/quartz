## There are different perspectives on creating long-lasting romantic desire

> [!ai] AI
>
Esther Perel and John Gottman have two different perspectives on sustaining long-term desire in monogamous relationships.
>

>
> Gottman, on the other hand, believes that building intimacy through emotional connection is the key to sustaining desire in long-term relationships. He emphasizes the importance of [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|open communication]], empathy, and understanding each other's needs to build a strong emotional bond that can sustain desire over time.

### Maintain mystery to create desire says Esther Perel

> [!NOTE] Keep a comfortable distance
> In her book "Mating in Captivity," Esther Perel highlights a [[Embrace contradiction with an open mind|contradiction]] in modern relationships: the opposing forces of familiarity and novelty, stability and mystery. While we seek love, which is about safety and security, we also desire passion, which is about risk, adventure, and novelty. Love is about having, while desire is about wanting, and we can only want what we don't already possess.
>
> Perel suggests that the solution to this problem is maintaining autonomy and preserving a space of eroticism within oneself, creating enough distance to allow wanting to emerge. The key is to sustain a little bit of dissatisfaction, without falling into frustration or despair, and nourishing one's curious and "moving-toward" energy.
>
> Perel explains that desire involves wanting a bridge to cross, which requires intentionally adding distance and creating an enjoyable sense of edgy instability and uncertainty.
> \-[[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

Our society tends to emphasize this a bit more. It's a higher adrenaline method and is similar to a itch-scratch-relief-itch cycle. As humans, though, it's harder to understand the experience of wanting from the experience of liking. Similar to [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|non-attachment]].

>
> In her exploration of desire and relationships, Perel delves into the allure of forbidden acts and the erotic charge they can bring. She highlights the paradox that while sex leads to procreation, it can also spell disaster for couples in terms of maintaining desire. Perel's central theme revolves around reconciling the human needs for security and adventure in committed relationships.
>
> She explains how contemporary couples seek emotional security and passionate love, a combination that was historically contradictory. The crisis of desire in modern relationships, according to Perel, often stems from a crisis of imagination. She differentiates between love and desire, emphasizing that desire involves wanting an "Other" who remains mysterious and elusive.
>
> Additionally, Perel stresses that desire requires space and independence, contrasting it with caretaking which can hinder desire. Drawing from her international research, she reveals that people are most drawn to their partners when they see them in their element, apart from themselves, and when they experience novelty and laughter together.
