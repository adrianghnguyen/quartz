[[My core values define what matters|Curiosity is one of my core values.]] [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|Curiosity is a basic motivation for the human experience]]

The etymology of the word philosophy comes from the word "lover of knowledge." It's interesting that [[Rachel Cao]] made the comment after showing her my Obsidian writing that if I were in another world, another life, perhaps I would've been a philosopher. With my current knowledge, it seems like many scientists on [[Knowledge convergence|converging]] on [[REF-What Is Consciousness|understanding consciousness]] explored through means such as [[REF - Intersection of AI and Neuroscience by Fridman and Huberman|artificial intelligence]].

At a [[Personal reflections on my childhood|young age]], I felt like I was made to think that I was too many questions and should be shamed for it. I remember that [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] in a moment of anger told me to stop asking why.

So I learned to [[Shame and guilt are inherited|hold onto the message]] that I should [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|suppress my curiosity]]. This developed into [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|anxiety]] where I felt restrained in my thought processes. This was reinforced [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my teenage years]] when she relayed an offhand comment ([[Be succinct when communicating]]) by [[Tim Trinh|my stepdad]] that he feels like I'm a know it all. Arrogant. Sais-tout. He was probably right and that part of my overconfidence came from a place of low [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] as a way to [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|protect my ego]] but also it may involve some of his [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|own personal projections]]. %%See also [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others]].%%

Interestingly enough, this is also why I think my friends enjoy spending time with me. [[Rachel Cao]] made the comment that I'm naturally very curious and [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|want to understand]] [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|why things are the way they are]]. While talking with my friends, there was often a [[Dealing with our inner critic|little voice in the back of my head]] wondering why do my thoughts jump all over the place. I would find it difficult to explain how seeing a random thing led to my mind making 3 jaunts over to make me [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|laugh at silly things]].

It turns out that maybe [[The various ways of loving yourself|I am]] [[Natural and acquired competencies|pretty decent]] at making connections between unrelated [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|concepts]]. Perhaps due to a strong [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|associative memory]]. I do know [[Types of Potential Talent|abstracted thinking]] was always linked my level of [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creativity]]. So it leads me to here where I am falling into a binge of writing after [[Why I write in Obsidian|discovering Obsidian]], a [[Reduce mental load through cognitive offloading strategies|note taking]] software focused on [linked thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/download-lyt-kit). It's exemplified by [Andy Matuschak in his writing style](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), one my favourite [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|second brains]].

I may have the ability to enter [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow]] more easily than the average person - a trait shared by people with [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]].

The goal of this exercise is to partially examine where my curiosity stems from, through [[Writing is the medium by which we think|introspection]]. After all, [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values guide behaviors]].
