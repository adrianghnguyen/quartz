# Natural and acquired competencies

#status/done

---

Competencies are the ability to do something successfully or efficiently. For [[High intellectual potential overview|those who are gifted]], they may possess above-average competencies in certain areas.

There are two main types:
- Natural competencies
- Acquired competencies

## Natural competency

Exceptional ability which emerges during childhood which will develop with the person. It is important this this implies that it is not innate (endogenous?) and is mutable.^[p.26-27 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.] It is the most commonly associated trait of HPI in our societal psyche.

## Acquired competencies

Acquired competencies are defined as the ability to acquire knowledge ([[Transform information into knowledge]]) and to methodically develop an ability in multiple human activities such as academic, artistic, sports, music, etc. ^[p.28 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

It's what is commonly meant by exceptional competencies (general/specific) in modern conversations. It's important to note that mere presence of giftedness is not related to adult success. HPI requires effort ([[Talent is dedication by few]]).
