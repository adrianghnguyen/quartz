The ultralearning philosophy is a [[Think strategically|thinking strategy]] for acquiring skills and knowledge through self-directed intense study aka cramming. It was first presented in [[Ultralearning by Scott Young|Ultralearning by Scott Young]]. It was first introduced to me as a [[Think strategically|strategy]] from the [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|accelerated learning philosophy]].

It follows some of the principles behind [[Learn new skills through projects|project-based learning]]. It relies on mechanisms of [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] and [[Continuous feedback leads to change|continuous feedback]]. [[All learning is dependent on feedback|All learning is dependent on feedback.]]

> Ultralearning is a [[Think strategically|strategy]] for acquiring skills and knowledge in a self-directed, intense way. It’s about deciding what you want to learn, then committing to a period of deep, [[Focus your learning by removing distractions|focused learning]] activities that push you to your limits. That’s the best way to get in flow and compress your learning into the shortest possible time.
>
> The ability to learn quickly is probably one of the most critical skills for success in our fast-changing world. Not only can you advance your career (or switch careers) easily, you can also master anything you’re interested in, to become more confident, productive and fulfilled.

It's important to note that this is a strategy, and there are alternatives such as traditional schooling/formal schooling and certifications. With that being said, this is useful for people who enjoy their [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal autonomy]] in self-directed education.

## The goal of ultralearning is deep skill mastery

Ultimately, ultralearning is meant to help us achieve rapid and profound mastery or expertise in a specific skill or subject matter through highly focused and efficient self-directed learning. It's part of the toolkit for [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|becoming an expert with a unique set of skills]].

## The 9 principles of ultralearning

There are 9 main principles which guide the ultralearning philosophy:

1. [[Build a metalearning roadmap|Metalearning begins with a roadmap.]]
2. [[Focus your learning by removing distractions|Concentrate on learning with complete focus.]] 
3. [[Apply skills directly to learn|The best way of learning is to dive right into the subject and apply the skills directly.]]
4. [[Improve weaknesses relentlessly|Improve on weaknesses by working on them relentlessly]]. 
5. [[Test your ability to recall knowledge|Test your knowledge often to improve your memory.]]
6. [[All learning is dependent on feedback|All learning is dependent on feedback]]
7. [[Improving our memory|Improve memory by using strategies to increase information retention.]]
8. [[Master a subject to develop intuition|Master a subject to develop intuition.]]
9. [[Develop mastery by getting uncomfortable|Learn beyond what is comfortable to develop mastery]]

## Personal reflections on ultralearning

[[2023-08-30]] As for myself, I think this is a good fit since [[Curiosity as my worldview|I'm intensely curious]] and school is a bit more rigid in terms of education structure. Perhaps going back to graduate school is something I could revisit at a later time. I prefer being able to study at my own pace which may be more intense at times.

[[2023-09-01]] I think it can be highly beneficial in helping me move along in my [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|career journey]] and being one step to [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|finding meaningful work]] It's a a great way to rapidly [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|grow as a person]] and moves me one step closer to developing an [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|expert mentality]].
