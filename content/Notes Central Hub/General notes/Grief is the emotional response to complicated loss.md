![[Grief is like the ocean#^de4820]]

Grief is an [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|emotional response]] to loss and tends to be accompanied by feelings of intense sadness, sorrow and [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|feelings of pain]]. The source of loss can come from [[Examples of life transitions|multiple sources of life transitions]] such as the death of a loved one, end of a significant relationship, loss of a cherished dream or [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|ruined expectations]].

## Personal reflections on grief

I need to be careful at times - to be vigilant about my [[Mental illness|mental illness]] and recognize that perhaps it's pointing to other sources of unexplored grief. I think it's okay to accept the circumstances of my childhood - I feel a sense of guilt and shame when it comes to accepting that it may have been difficult.

I feel guilt over feeling bad for my poor childhood. A vicious circle perhaps. I keep telling myself that I shouldn't compare myself to others since I had many privileges in its upbringing. I think [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|staying with my emotional center of gravity]] means being able to accept it without judgment - to take them as serious as they are.

Maybe a [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|better way]] of looking at it is the way [[Reparenting ourselves is the process of giving what our inner child lacked|a gentle parent]] would soothe a child. To tell them, it's okay to feel such a loss so deeply. When I put it into words, perhaps that is why I feel culpable for my feelings. I learned in recent times, in my family therapy sessions %% with [[Marleen MacDonald|Marleen MacDonald]] %% that after [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|his passing]], no one took the time to [[Personal reflections on my childhood|tell little Adrian]] that he was gone, to leave through the door and with a final goodbye.

I think learning to let go of [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood]] and making my happiness independent of [[Tran Huynh|my mom]]'s emotional progress would be a form of letting go of expectations.

[[Nature promotes connectivity|Nature promotes connections]] which is perhaps why the loss of connection may be so painful. Think of a tree being robbed of soil, fish from water, a human from a significant person in their life. Perhaps it is why grief is such a complex feeling of [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional suffering]].

[[2023-12-01]] I am wondering if the breakdown of [[2023-11-30|yesterday]] was related to surfacing feelings of loss, whether it be related to [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my father]] or that of [[Personal reflections on my childhood|the sadness of my childhood]]. But I should look towards the [[Learned optimism is a skill|bright side of things]]




### A message to myself and my personal grief

So here's what I would like to [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|tell myself]]:

> You've had a [[Personal reflections on my childhood|difficult childhood]] and there were few people to surround you and shower you with love. The external circumstances which led to your upbringing are not alone for you to bear - you do not need to feel guilt for having such complicated feelings.
>
> Growing up without a father is difficult. No one talking to you about his departure would understandable leave an open hole in one's heart. Too many big feelings for such a small little boy.
>
> It's okay to let yourself be sad, be angry at the opportunities which were robbed. It's okay to recognize that you had many privileges in some ways and in other ways things may have been more difficult. The world is sometimes unfair like that. It's also okay to remember that it's not a competition misery - it's okay to feel the way that you do and to treat them in all its seriousness.
>
> Your mother was not in a position to be there for all your needs - she had her own battles to deal with. You can feel loved and comforted by the fact that she's trying to understand. It may not change the past - but perhaps it can lead to a better future.
>
> Don't feel so alone in your feelings. I would like to be there for you. I will give you all the [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|love and warmth]] which you need. So [[Self-confidence|trust in me okay]]?
