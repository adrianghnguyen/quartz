The better questions to ask are the following:

- This child may be gifted or potentially gifted in *what area or domain*?
- What [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences|forms of intelligence]] or [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies seem potentially above average]]  for this **particular** child?

In a nutshell, here's a shortlist:

- Physical/motor/artistic talent
- Social or introspective talents
- Intellectual/logic/reasoning talents

## Determining if your child has potential for talent

The first step is to determine what kind of giftedness to the child may possess. Only then can we determine the appropriate course of action to support the child.

You should look to examine their behaviors and consult professional psychologists or neuropsychologists. Consider the relationship your child will have with these professionals as it may impact their results^[Silverman, 2018].

It is possible to spot HPI at first sight if you are a trained professional and clinical experience, including only qualitative assessments.^[p.145 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

### Principles to follow in identifying gifted child's potential for talent and their assessments

1. Be careful and understand the subtexts of the way [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|talent is defined]] by the assessments and its interpreted scores
2. Assessment should take into account what resources are available for the gifted child post-evaluation
3. The quality of the psychometric assessments matters
4. Using multiple measures of assessment tends to be more reliable and should include a mix of quantifiable (IQ test, Weschler/WISC test) and qualitative observations (clinical interviews, portfolio analysis, general observation)
5. The professional's judgement should be the final deciding factor overriding assessments in determining HPI in the child
6. Assessments should be repeated more than once to ensure validity and reliable - not a one time thing

### We can determine talent or HPI at any point in time, including birth

Never too early or never too late. It can be as early as around birth and during all [[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI|developmental milestones of gifted children]]. As a result, it's possible to begin evaluating at a very early age.

Interestingly enough, IQ test scores amongst children with HPI only tends to stabilize at around 9 years old - holding constant until adulthood.^[Schneider et al. 2014]
