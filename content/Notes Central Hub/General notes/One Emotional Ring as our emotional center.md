## Our emotional center is a complex system of older brain organs

> [!quote] The One Ring
> “One hedonic brain system to mediate them all.”
> \- Kent Berridge and Morten Kringelbach

There are multiple brain components, located within the the **[[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system aka lizard brain]]**,  which play a role in our processes of **enjoying, expecting, and eagerness**. These three also form the basis of pleasure, learning and motivational processes.^[Berridge, K. C., & Kringelbach, M. L. (2013). Neuroscience of affect: brain mechanisms of pleasure and displeasure. Current opinion in neurobiology, 23(3), 294-303.]

### The emotional center consists of multiple involved brain organs

- Ventral pallidum (also known as the VTa)
- [[Nucleus accumbens]]
- Amygdala
- Brain stem parabrachial nucleus
- More…unmentioned

> For those of you who keep a map of the midbrain on your wall and would like to follow along at home, the organs involved in these systems are the ventral pallidum, the nucleus accumbens body and shell (this is the part from the Iggy Pop study), the amygdala, and the brain stem parabrachial nucleus, among others. (There’s a great tidbit for cocktail parties—nothing like the phrase “brain stem parabrachial nucleus” to impress sexy singles over a dirty martini.)

> The thing is, these are not really the “pleasure centers”—or not just pleasure centers.
>
> What we often describe as the pleasure centers or reward centers of the brain are in fact crucially more subtle and interesting than that. To call it “reward” or “pleasure” is like saying “vagina” when you mean “vulva”: Pleasure is part of it, certainly, but only part, and to deny the other parts their names is to deny their significance and misunderstand the nature of the multifaceted beast.

## Overview of Emotional Ring Processes

> [!quote] One ring to govern our emotions
> When I say “One Ring” for the rest of the book, I mean this cluster of **enjoying, expecting, and eagerness**, where all your emotional responses—sex, stress, love, disgust, etc.—compete and interact and influence each other.
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

The one ring processes all of our emotional and motivational responses which also includes the following:^[ [[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-61615]]]

- stress responses (fear, aggression, and shutdown)
- disgust
- all forms of pleasure (ranging from physical to artistic, love and [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|social connections]], [[Dual control model of sexual response|sex]])

There are **three core processes** in regards to emotional responses:

1. Enjoyment aka reward
2. Expecting aka is linked current stimuli to future outcomes (like Pavlov's dog)
3. Eagerness aka approach/avoidance behaviour

## Relationship to Human Sexuality and Arousal

> How do these systems work in human sexuality? If something activates your sexual accelerator—say, your partner kissing you—expecting has done its job. Like the rats with a lemon fetish, your accelerator has learned that kissing is sexually relevant. Expecting is neutral, neither nice nor nasty, just … relevant. But when the cue that activates expecting is not only sexually relevant but also nice (which often depends on context), it activates enjoying, too. And when it’s nice enough, it gives rise to eagerness.
>
> The sequence works this way: Something sexually relevant happens, and your brain goes, “Hey, that’s sexually relevant.” That’s expecting. And if the context is right, your brain also goes, “Hey, that’s nice!” That’s enjoying. And if the stimulus is nice enough, your brain goes, “Ooh, go get more of that!” That’s eagerness.

Later on [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]] will talk about how the [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one emotional ring]] is linked to [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension|orgasm]] and pleasure. Research within this field is still early on.
