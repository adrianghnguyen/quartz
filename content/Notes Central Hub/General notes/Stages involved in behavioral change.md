Related to [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time]]

## Stages of change theory overview

“The Stages of Change theory maintains behavior change is a process that unfolds over time through a sequence of stages. There are five stages in the 1992 version of the Stages of Change model.

There are specific strategies for each stage to promote an individual behavior to the next stage, and prevent a relapse to a previous stage” (Prochaska et al, 1992). ([Campbell et al. 2009](http://www.editlib.org/p/32454))

This was first developed while studying how smokers quit smoking out of their own will and led to long-term behavioral change (6+ months).

Some people may decide to not change their behaviours because they believe that our personalities are fixed and innate. Instead, adopt a [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset to learn to adapt]] However, [[Neuroplasticity|our brains are surprisingly adaptable]].

### Stages of [[Behavioural change is difficult|behavioural change]]

1. Precontemplation - (Not thinking about change)
2. Contemplation - (Thinking about change, weighing pros and cons)
3. Preparation - (Intending to take action within next month)
4. Action - (Actively involved in change)
5. Maintenance - (Have maintained change for six months, working to prevent relapse)
