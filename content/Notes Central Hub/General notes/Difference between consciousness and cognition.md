[[Consciousness is the state of being aware and alive]] and cognition are two separate but related concepts in psychology.

- Consciousness refers to the **state of being aware** of one's surroundings, thoughts, and emotions,
- Cognition refers to **the mental processes** involved in thinking, perceiving, and understanding.

For example, a person may be conscious of their surroundings but may not be cognitively processing or understanding what they are seeing or hearing. Conversely, a person may be cognitively processing information without being fully conscious of their actions or surroundings.
