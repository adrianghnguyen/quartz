> Positive self-talk refers to the practice of using affirming and encouraging language to oneself. It involves creating a positive internal dialogue that promotes self-belief, resilience, and [[Learned optimism is a skill|optimism]].
>
> By consciously replacing negative thoughts with positive ones, individuals can improve their self-esteem, manage stress, and foster a more constructive mindset.

Positive self-talk is creating positive internal dialogue which can help us overcome the [[Dealing with our inner critic|inner critic]]. Engaging in this personal habit can help me [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe perspective]], [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|overcome feelings of hopelessness]] and help me deal with [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|difficult moments in life]].

[[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|Emotional pain]] can be difficult and sometimes we need to take a break from it. So we may choose to [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|numb it instead or ignore it completely]]. Self-compassion is learning to be patient in this [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional healing process]].

> Embracing positive self-talk can have numerous benefits, including increased resilience, greater self-confidence, improved problem-solving skills, and enhanced overall well-being. By consciously cultivating positive self-talk habits, individuals can better navigate challenges, build a healthy self-image, and develop a more [[Learned optimism is a skill|optimistic outlook]] on life.

In order to [[Happiness requires action|be happy]] and emotionally mature, we should seek to [[Dealing with our inner critic|change our negative inner voice]]. Remember that [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|you are enough and worthy of love as you are]]. I'm thinking of Harimu from Street Woman Fighter 2. Just as [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|Yuqi]] believes in her capabilities, I should shout from the rooftops [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|how much I love myself]].

The best inner voice is gentle, kind, and unhurried. It should offer support and understanding, like a sympathetic friend, devoid of harsh judgments and panic. I should adopt a [[External friendly voices|friendly external voice]] when mine becomes overly critical - it's about [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-love]].

## How to talk to myself positively

Remember that [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation]].

We can learn to internalize helpful and constructive voices over time, such as those of [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|real friends]], therapists, or authors, which eventually become our own thoughts. That's part of how I can learn to [[Building resilience requires self-acceptance|build resilience.]] These are some positive mantras to help rmeember.

Positive talk is one of the key facets in learning how to [[REF Learning to Forgive Ourselves|forgive myself]]. It's also learning to cope with my [[Dealing with our inner critic|inner critic]] and mastering the [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|Monkey mind]]. I feel like I never learned [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|this skill]] as a [[Personal reflections on my childhood|child]].  %% It's tough when I have a lot of [[Unloving parents generate self-hatred in their children|self-hatred due to lack of parental love]]. %%

However, if I can learn to build this habit, I can come closer to finding the [[Life significance is having an appreciation for how our life has inherent value|inherent value]] in my life. There are many positive messages which I felt were lacking in my early life, but with the help of [[Adult relationships can cure childhood wounds|adult relationships]], I can learn to rebuild [[My struggles with self-esteem|this self-image]] with [[External friendly voices|friendly external voices]].

### Personal mantras

I think there's a lot of beauty and power in personal mantras - they require less cognitive effort and can help us escape from repetitive thought loops by branching off to a healthier thought pattern. If we think of it as a labyrinth, it provides with a door to escape to more positive thoughts.

> [!question] I wonder how this techniques works with [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)]]
>
> It most likely serves as a challenge against our negative thoughts - similar to the [[Use the disputation strategy to overcome pessimism through facts|the disputation strategy for pessimism]]

It can take many forms such as:
- Reciting positive affirmations about myself such as
	- [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|"I am capable"]]
	- "I am deserving of success"
	- [[Building resilience requires self-acceptance|"I am strong and resilient"]]
- Providing myself with self-encouragement and words of motivations during [[Dealing with failure and mistakes|challenging situations]] or [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|perceived failure]]
	- "I can do this"
	- [[Show up and at least try your best|"I will give it my best"]]
	- "I have dealt with difficult situations in the past and I can do it again!"
	- ["There is no shame in defeat so long as the spirit is unconquered"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXH0C7Qo2GQ) %% from [[My love letter to Starcraft|Starcraft]] %%
- [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|Positive reframing]] by changing my perspective and interpretation of a situation by focusing on the positive aspects or opportunities for growth
	- Thinking [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|"I learned valuable lessons from this experience"]] instead of [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|"I failed"]]
- [[The various ways of loving yourself|Giving myself love]]
	- [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|“I am enough, just as I am.”]]
	- “I deserve love and respect, just like everyone else.”
	- “I am capable of growth and change.”
	- “My mistakes and flaws do not define me.”
	- “I am strong and resilient.”
- Remind myself that [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|I am not alone]]
	- "There are many people who appreciate and love you"
	- "You have many friends and people who show up because you are a [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|worthy human being]]"
	- "[[Asking for help requires strength|Asking for help is not a sign of weakness]] but takes [[Daring greatly is to embrace vulnerability and face life with courage|immense courage]]"
- [[Not everything needs to be shared|"I am honest and transparent, even when I don't share every detail."]]
