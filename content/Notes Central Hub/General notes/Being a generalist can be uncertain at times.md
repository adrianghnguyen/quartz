Related to [[Being a generalist means having a broad set of skills and interests]]

Being a generalist can be uncertain at times as our [[Job crafting|career trajectory]] will be more uncertain since there is no clear defined path. This is opposed to that of someone who decides to become a [[Cult of specialization|specialist]].

> In his book [[Range by David Epstein|Range]], author and researcher David Epstein quotes art historian William Wallace who estimated that the world-renowned artist Michelangelo left roughly two-thirds of his sculptures unfinished (Range, 164). He followed the aphorism “I know who I am when I see what I do.” Epstein writes:

> "It [specialization] is attractive because it is a tidy prescription, low on uncertainty and high on efficiency….Experimentation is not a tidy prescription, but it is common, and has its advantages, and it requires more than the typical motivational-poster lip service to a tolerance for failure….[[Understanding the complexity of life|Approach your own personal voyage]] and projects like Michelangelo approached a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go, and [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|even to abandon a previous goal and change directions entirely should the need arise]]."
