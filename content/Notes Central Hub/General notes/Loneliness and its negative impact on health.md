# Loneliness negatively impacts our long-term happiness and health

#status/done

Related to [[Module 4 Love and Relationships, Part 2]]

[[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone]] which differs from solitude. The first thing to understand is the difference between loneliness and isolation. We can be surrounded yet feel lonely. Conversely, we may be isolated from others but not feel lonely.

Loneliness plays a significant role in our [[Habits for creating long-term happiness|long-term happiness]] as well as our physical health.

According to Dr. Aparna Atluru, practicing psychiatrist, there's a body of research which shows that loneliness has negative repercussions on life expectancy as well as causing a "low-level inflammatory responses, increases in [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] and other [[Cortisol is the stress hormone]]". Essentially, it can cause [[Types of stress|chronic stress]]. 

For example, loneliness has similar negative effects to heavy smoking including effects such as a compromised immune system, lessened impulse control, heightened risk for [[metabolic syndrome|metabolic syndrome]] which can make it more difficult to control our weight (?) and increases our likelihood for death.

It can cause [[Types of stress|chronic stress]], low-level inflammatory responses, and increases in [[Cortisol is the stress hormone]]. [[Loneliness and its negative impact on health|Loneliness]] also alters the neurochemistry of the brain, specifically [[dopamine|dopamine neurons]] , making it harder to feel joy even with triggering inputs. This can potentially lead to depression or anhedonia. The content highlights that loneliness is typically studied more in older adults but can affect individuals across their lifespan.

## Loneliness creates psychological vulnerability

When we are lonely and longing for social connection, we enter a vulnerable state in which our [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|decision making is impaired]].  One of the ways people seek to fill the void of loneliness is by using [[Social media encourages loneliness|social media which can create false isolating relationships]].

[[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|Our natural instincts can pull us in the wrong direction. It can be a good time to employ the opposite signal strategy to avoid isolating ourselves.]]

According to Arthur Brooks. a lot more people are being afraid of being objected than ever before. There's less people in love in their 20s today than previously. He says that people are more afraid to engage in [[Entrepreneurial love is taking risks with the heart|entrepreneurial love]] as a result of a cultural shift.

We need to overcome this fear [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|to do what is uncomfortable]] by [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|reaching out to others, developing our social muscles]] instead of pulling back. Move towards [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|making connections]] instead of letting the [[Fear of rejection|fear of rejection]] hold you back from making [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|meaningful connections]].

## Loneliness is linked to reduced overall brain volume

> The people with the lowest amount of social contact had overall brain volume that was significantly lower than those with the most social contact. The total brain volume, or the sum of white and grey matter, as a percentage of the total intracranial volume, or the volume within the cranium, including the brain, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid, was 67.3% in the lowest contact group compared to 67.8% in the highest contact group. They also had lower volumes in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and amygdala that play a role in memory and are affected by dementia.^[ [SOCIAL ISOLATION LINKED TO LOWER BRAIN VOLUME](https://www.aan.com/PressRoom/Home/PressRelease/5099)]

New evidence seems to show that loneliness is associated with brain atrophy and decrease in brain mass. They also have a lower volume in the areas of hippocampus and amygdala which play a role in our memory and would possible increase one's susceptibility to dementia.
## Loneliness can alter the neurochemistry of the brain

Loneliness can change the neurochemistry of the brain and turn off [[dopamine|dopamine]] neurons, making it harder to feel joy even if there are inputs that would normally trigger it.

This can persist even after prolonged periods of loneliness, and can increase the likelihood of mild cognitive impairment transitioning into dementia.

Research shows that this is typically studied more in older adults but can affect individuals across the lifespan.
