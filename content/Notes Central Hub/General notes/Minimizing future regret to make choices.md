# Make choices which minimize future regret

> [!NOTE] Nikiv's advice on minimizing regret
>  [Minimizing regret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwG_qR6XmDQ) is always a good [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] for choosing problems to solve. Will I still be worried about this a year from now? If so, it's probably important and worth worrying about and solving.

>  If not, let it go and move on. Better side on [making decisions](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/psychology/decision-making) and reversing in light of new knowledge than falling victim to fear or risk.

It's often better to simply [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|Do the thing]] and simply pick a [[Narrow your scope of work|pick a scope and run as far as I can]]. It's okay to fail or [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|re-assess and change directions]].

## Most people regret not making big life decisions earlier

> I often think of Andy Grove's observation that everyone wishes they'd made most of their [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|big decisions]] 6 mos earlier — job changes, breakups, firings… The natural conclusion is that you should make the big changes extremely fast — shortly after you first think of them.

Most people wish they underwent the [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|major life changes]] at an earlier time rather than later. So when it comes to [[Examples of life transitions|common life transitions]] such as breakups, job changes, etc. it's [[Make quick and decisive actions|better to pull the trigger earlier]] and accept that the next period of [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transition]] while will be a bit rocky. 

## How to decide if a decision is important or not

Perhaps it's worth putting time in [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|decisions which will have a great impact on our future]]. Often times, we have [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|forks in the road]] and we need to look deeply within us to know what the correct path is. However, humans are not very great at looking at the big picture nor looking into the future since it's often unpredictable.

One of the ways to decide if a decision is important is if it'll cause us to have regret.

- Will it cause us regret? If so, [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|pick a path which will minimize regret]].
- Will it harm other people?
- What are [[Second order thinking|second order consequences]] of the decision?
- Is it a choice which is a reflection of our personal character? Is it in line with our personal values? Make an [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|authentic choice]].
- Will it cause others to see us differently?


Sometimes, we need to look at what our gut is saying - it serves as a good negative feedback indicator, but it's important to recognize [[Gut feelings|its limitations]].
