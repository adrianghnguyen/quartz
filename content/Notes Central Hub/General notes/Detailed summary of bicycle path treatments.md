# Detailed summary of bicycle path treatments

Related to [[REF Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver]]

These are the associated costs with building out bicycle path lanes and their various types of protection levels.

I find it interesting that in the maintenance costs, they use wording which seem to imply that vehicle striking the protection and the protection needing to be reinstalled as a possible con. Shouldn't we consider that maintenance as part of the cost of a [[Value of statistical life in making cost benefit analysis of safety regulations|statistical life]]? Most of these would probably provide an ROI >$10M fairly easily.
