## Why do humans like jazz?

This is one of the most fascinating videos I've ever seen. And it has cute birds!

Here are my main takeaways:
- Music is a learned human habit with an evolutionary purpose to train us to process difficult information
	- Jazz is essentially throwing the kitchen sink of information at our brain hence why it is 'complex'
- The goddamn [[Fourier transform|Fourier Transform]] haunts me everywhere I go and is done a biological apparatus in the cochlear

## General transcript of the video

> [!ai] AI
>
> - Jazz and pop culture have made it clear that jazz is an acquired taste.
> - Music has become more chaotic and abstract in the last 100 years, breaking away from classical music's structured and organized form.
> - Charles Darwin believed that early humans used music to attract mates, but Stephen Pinker believes that music is a byproduct of our linguistic ability and our ability to process sounds.
> - Music acts as a kind of moral education, such as drumming traditions of the away people in West Africa, which rely on complex polyrhythms.
> - Pythagoras carried out experiments with a monochord and concluded that simple frequency ratios sound good while high integer ratios sound dissonant.
> - The cochlea performs a [[Fourier transform]], separating audio signals into different frequencies that are each connected to a neuron which sends a signal to the brain saying that it heard this frequency.
> - Neurons communicate primarily through electrical signals when they receive neurotransmitters from sensory cells or other neurons. This triggers ion gates which move positively charged potassium and sodium ions inside and outside of the neuron, creating a flow of current into the neuron. This turns the neuron into an RC circuit where the key value is the voltage across the membrane. Once this reaches a certain threshold, it'll trigger voltage-gated ion channels to discharge the neuron, sending neurotransmitters to the next neuron.
> - The entropy of neural signals reaching your brain is low for consonant low integer chords and high for dissonant high integer chords. This makes sense because our brain prefers unambiguous cases.
> - Listening to music might be our way of training for processing difficult information.

## What is entropy of music

> [!ai] AI
>
> Key concepts related to entropy of music:
>
> - [[Entropy|Entropy]] is a measure of disorder or unpredictability in a system.
> - In the context of music, entropy can be used to measure the degree of randomness or complexity in a piece of music.
> - Some researchers have suggested that there is an optimal level of entropy that makes music enjoyable for listeners.
> - However, others argue that too much entropy can make music sound chaotic and unappealing.
> - Entropy can be influenced by various factors such as rhythm, melody, harmony, and timbre.
> - Understanding the relationship between entropy and musical structure may help composers create more engaging and meaningful music.
