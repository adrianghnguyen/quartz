Related to [[2023-08-07]]

It's 4am at the moment and there are many thoughts spiraling in my head at the moment. I'm uncertain to say if it's rumination or something else to be quite honest. It feels like I'm stuck within my own mind and I'm not sure what it's trying to tell me.

In terms of recent emotional incidents, the primary one I can think of is unloading to my mom about [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood experiences]]. And I guess it's somewhat in a limbo not knowing what she's crying about.

I recently finished watching king the land and the male protagonist also dealt with an absent mom. I empathize with his angerâ€¦but I'm not sure if I've learned to forgive my mom. I still think there's a difference between accepting our hurt while if someone wishes to [[Successful relationships follow a cycle of rupture and repair|repair a relationship]], it takes them to understand and communicate.

Part of me feels like it's endless frustration and two steps forward, one step back in terms of her growth. Just talk to me like an adult please.

It's complicated because the other woman in my life came back, %%[[Melodie Zhou|Melodie Zhou]]%% and I see her struggling. And I guess both of these things would be bringing back [[Use powerful emotions towards constructive ends|strong feelings]] and a heightened state of arousal. Do I [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|feel threatened]]?

I know at this hour that [[Negative thoughts are highest at night|negative moods are highest at night]]. I know lack of sleep is probably not helping me much unless I think about [[Pause and do a self-check in|HALT]].

But the exercise in [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] is helping me out I believe. It's giving my inner conscience a chance to explore itself and let itself out rather than living as [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|endless mind chatter]].

The next day, after some more rest, perhaps I can engage in [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|cognitive reframing]] and have a fresh perspective on things.

I always found it easiest to write at night because there seems to be less of a filter and the words simply slip from my thoughts. At times, I've reviewed my wording which has felt some ethereal or written by another - it is not the voice I hear during the day. Perhaps there is less stimulation, less [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|mind suggestions]] since it's a [[Create a distraction-free environment|distraction-free environment]].

Me, my computer and the screen. Words to flow by the keyboard. What to do with it all? I'm unsure - but I'm hoping to have a clearer thoughts the next day. [[Show up and at least try your best|Showing up]] and [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] is already a positive victory [[Strategies for behavioural change|and worth celebrating the habit]].

Tomorrow will be a new day, we'll see what awaits me.
