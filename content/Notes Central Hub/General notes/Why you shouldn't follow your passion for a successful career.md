# Career fulfillment does not come from passion necessarily

 #status/done

> [!quote] Skill mastery is the predecessor to passion
> Most passionate employees are **not** those who followed their passion into a position, but instead those who have been around long enough to become [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport|good at what they do]].

There are two main approaches as to how one can approach their career: a passion-driven mindset and the [[Why you shouldn't follow your passion for a successful career|craftsman mentality]]. A passion-driven mindset is a poor approach to career fulfillment - opt for the [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsman mentality]] instead according to [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport|So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]].

The passion hypothesis claims that the key to occupational happiness is to first figure out what youâ€™re passionate about and then find [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|a job]] that matches this passion. The basic tenet is that the passion hypothesis, although widely believed, is both wrong and potentially dangerous.

A passion mindset is an approach to your working life in which you focus on the *value your job is offering you*. The passion mindset ultimately leads to **chronic dissatisfaction** and **daydreaming about the better jobs** you imagine existing out there waiting to be discovered.

With that being said, we should seek [[Use harmonious passion to find greater happiness|harmonious passion in our work which is a healthier mindset.]]  How do I reconcile this with [[My career mission|my career mission]]? I guess it's about being flexible to not be obstinate about the particular details but rather about the value which I can provide.

My personal takeaway is that we should have a big north star when it comes to our [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]], but we shouldn't be obsessed above the particular detail or specific work in terms of getting there.

## Courage not enough for a dream career

In social media, many authors and commentators promote that the only barrier between you and your dream job is building the courage to step off the expected path. This is a bad myth as it underplays the importance of also having [[Career capital|career capital]] to back up your [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career aspirations]]. It has led many people to *quit their current job and to end up in a new situation where they are much worse off than before*. ^086a52
