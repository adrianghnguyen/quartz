[[The Happiness Equation|Happiness is crucial to our well-being and can be defined through enjoyment, satisfaction and meaning.]]

We can consider happiness like an investment portfolio which requires a balanced mix of multiple factors [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|to make it easy to understand]]. We need these factors to be balanced in order for our happiness to grow in a sustainable way.

None of them can make happiness on their own, but all need to be nurtured to various extent.

The happiness portfolio does not control our happiness entirely.

We can think of it as the following breakdown:
1. **50% of happiness is inherited** in sense of our health at birth, early childhood conditions, etc.  %%Thank you [[Jessica Ly Ngo]]%%

> [!quote] The Dalai Lama on genuine happiness
> "Achieving genuine happiness may require bringing about a transformation in your outlook, your way of [[Writing is the medium by which we think|thinking]], and this is not a simple matter… It requires the application of so many different factors from different directions. You shouldn’t have the notion, for instance, that there is just one key, a secret, similar to taking proper care of the physical body; you need a variety of vitamins and nutrients, not just one or two. In the same way, in order to achieve happiness, you need a variety of approaches and methods to deal with and overcome the varied and complex negative mental states."
