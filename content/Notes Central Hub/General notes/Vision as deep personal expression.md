> Vision allows us to tap into what is [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|already moving within us at a deeper level, already asking for fuller expression]]. With vision, we are better able to recognize what resources, [[Stages involved in behavioral change|behavior changes]], and relationships we will need in order to reconnect with what is more important to us.

> When we have a clear vision, we feel more [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connections]]  to the world, more alive. The gap between our thought and action, our internal world and external world vanishes and we more fully occupy our "self".
