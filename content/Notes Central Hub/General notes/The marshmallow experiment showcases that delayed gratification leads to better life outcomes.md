Psychologist Walter Mischel from Santford University studied the ability to defer gratification and its relationship to success later in life. Those who had greater capacity for [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|self-control]] and able to delay their gratification were more likely to be successful in life.

## Findings from the marshmallow study

- In his experiment, Mischel gave young children a marshmallow and promised a second one if they waited to eat it.
- The goal of the study was to understand how children are able to resist temptation
- Some children waited and were rewarded with a second marshmallow, while others gave in and ate the first one.
- Years later, it was found that the children who were able to wait were more successful in various aspects of life.

## An addendum on the Marshmallow Test

> New studies done by [Dr. Mischel and his original team](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268119302641?via%3Dihub), as well as [other research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6050075/) that followed a much more diverse group of preschoolers, have found that the marshmallow test does not alone predict later measures of academic achievement or mid-life capital formation. However, as one of the key researchers, Dr. Daniel J. Benjamin, explains: “Getting people to pay attention to the marshmallow test was valuable because he believed, as I do, that what it aims to measure—self-control—is central to understanding human psychology and behavior.” Read [the study from the Anderson Review at UCLA](https://anderson-review.ucla.edu/new-study-disavows-marshmallow-tests-predictive-powers/) for further explanation.
