> Sexual desire refers to the natural, instinctual feeling of wanting to engage in sexual activity. It is a complex combination of physiological and psychological factors that drive individuals to seek sexual pleasure and intimacy. Sexual desire can vary greatly among individuals and can be influenced by factors such as hormones, personal experiences, and cultural influences. It is an essential aspect of human sexuality and plays a significant role in forming and maintaining intimate relationships.

 Sexual desire lives on a spectrum between spontaneous desire and responsive desire (only want sex when there are [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexual cues]] going on). It is not a 'hunger'. It dictates how as a person, how we respond to sex and our desire for it.

Some people can suddenly want sex (spontaneous desire) while others only respond to [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexual cues]] and then begin wanting sex in response.

> [!NOTE] Sexual desire summary from [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]
>
> - About 15 percent of women have a spontaneous desire style—they want sex out of the blue. Thirty percent experience responsive desire—they want sex only when something pretty erotic is already happening. The rest, about half of women, experience some combination of the two, depending on context.
> - Sex is not a drive, like hunger. It’s an “incentive motivation system,” like curiosity. So . . . stay curious.
> - When sex feels like a drive, it’s because of the little monitor in your emotional brain, whose job is to reduce discrepancies. The monitor motivates you to pursue novelty, pleasure, ambiguity, etc.
> - To increase sexual desire in a relationship, increase novelty, pleasure, ambiguity, and intensity (increase your heart rate!). See the worksheet on [this page](javascript:void(0)) to find out how.

is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions. It isn't the differential itself, but it's how the couples interact and manage it. Fights in couples and the problematic dynamics happen when there are different levels of desires. And one believes that their partner is the one that's wrong.

We can improve this by improving the [[Sexual context influences our arousal]].

> For example, let’s say Person A has a spontaneous desire style and Person B has a responsive style. In this scenario, Person A may feel rejected and undesirable because they almost always do the initiating, and then Person B may start to feel pushed and will resist more. Person A asks and asks and asks and feels rejected and hurt and resentful because Person B keeps [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|saying no]], no, no; and Person B feels defensive but also guilty and hurt because just being asked makes Person B feel like there must be something wrong. Meanwhile Person A may even start to wonder, “Am I broken? Do I want sex too much? Am I sexually obsessed or compulsive?” It’s a mess.
