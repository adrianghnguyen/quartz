## Sexual personality traits tends to be stable over our lifespan

Our propensity for [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|SES]] and [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|SIS]] are traits which tend to be stable over time similar to [[My MBTI|personality traits]] which can vary between individuals.^[ [[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-32069]]]

## Sensitive sexual accelerator and low sexual brake

### Sensitive sexual accelerator and low sexual brake means more risky behaviour and out of control feeling

People with [[Sexual Excitation System or Accelerator|sensitive accelerators]] and not so sensitive [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sexual brakes]] tend to engage in sexual risk taking and compulsivity.^[ [[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-37970]]]  It's because we're easily stimulated by [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|sexual stimuli]] so becoming highly motivated to pursue sex while the brain mechanisms of [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|SIS]] are not engaged in stopping the risky behaviour. As a result, during [[Stress response system lifecycle|stressful periods]], the brake would be minimal during this period of time.

- You're more likely to have more sexual partners
- use less protection
- feel less in control
- More likely to want [[Broken attachment driven sex|sex when stressed]] (called "*redliners*")

This is in contrast to other women who may be '*flatliners*' where they lose sexual interest when stressed.

## Sensitive sexual brakes

Those with sensitive [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sexual brakes]], regardless of [[SES and SIS are stable individual traits|accelerator]] are likely to have sexual dysfunctions of many kinds and it is **one of the strongest predictor of sexual problems**.^[  [[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-26959]]]. Since their inhibitions are so high, it's hard for them to get in a pleasurable state of mind.

Here are examples of sexual problems or challenges:

- Low interest in sex
- arousal difficulties
- [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension|orgasm]] difficulties
