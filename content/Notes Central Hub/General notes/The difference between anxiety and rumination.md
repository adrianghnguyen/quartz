# The difference between anxiety and rumination

> [!NOTE] Summary
> Anxiety and overthinking are two different things. Anxiety is a disorder characterized by fear, worry, and nervousness. Overthinking is a [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive process]] where a person gets stuck in their thoughts.

The difference between anxiety and overthinking is that

- **[[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]]** is when you’re worrying about something that *may happen* and often accompanied by physical symptoms, like racing heart, sweating, and feeling lightheaded.
- **[[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|overthinking]]** is when you’re obsessively thinking about something that has *already happened* may not have any physical symptoms but can still make you feel mentally exhausted.

For example, if you’re anxious about an upcoming test, you may be overthinking it if you can’t stop thinking about a test you took in the past and did poorly on. Both anxiety and overthinking can lead to distress and affect your daily life, but there are ways to manage both.

Overthinking can be a sign of anxiety, but the two are not the same. Sometimes there maybe be a fine line between the two, but it’s important to understand the difference so you can manage both in healthy ways.
