Mental flexibility can come under many terms such as cognitive flexibility, mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, [[task switching]], task shifting and attention switching, attention shifting.^[Wikipedia]

> Cognitive flexibility is here understood as the human ability to adapt cognitive processing strategies to face new and unexpected conditions and is intrinsically linked to attentional processes (Cañas, Quesada, Antolí, & Fajardo, 2003). As mindfulness meditation is dependant on the (re-)investment of attention on a moment by moment basis, mindfulness training should hypothetically lead to increased cognitive flexibility and an increased ability to respond in a non-habitual fashion.

In my eyes, an educated mind can example problems from a variety of perspective, learn to draw upon a [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|diverse pool of knowledge]], ability to draw from a multitude of [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|decision-making models]] being able to [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|consider various perspectives]] when it comes to a subject.

It is the ability to know when one needs to change gears cognitively (cognitive shifting) to apply a different concept, use a different strategy or [[Preventing cognitive bias using cognitive forcing strategies|use cognitive bias avoidance techniques]]. It would also include the capability to re-center one's self and notice when one is drifting away from the task - it could also apply to re-examining one's personal values and grand objectives to auto-evaluate.

One can summarize it as the following:
1. Ability to undergo [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual change]]
2. Learning when and how to develop adaptive strategies
3. The capacity to ingest new ideas and evaluate it against prior information and determine its validity and congruency in the global schema of one's mind - or the ability to forge said connections through associative thinking
4. In the absence of information, one can [[Think strategically|develop strategic thinking]] by asking the right questions to begin [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gathering information]] and turn said [[Transform information into knowledge|information into knowledge]]
5. [[Build a latticework of mental models to develop grey thinking|Adopt a mindset of grey thinking]]

### Mental flexibility has many names



## Psychological theories explaining cognitive flexibility

Mental flexibility involves the ability to apply or modify one's mental models in the face of ever-changing situations. According to scientific theory, it is a component of executive functions which are higher-order cognitive processes. Higher order cognitive processes have evolved later in the human brain's history. These types of [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]] help us [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|manage our emotions through self-regulation]] as well as thoughts and actions in order to  [[Purpose in life|achieve our goals]] .

### The multiple theoretical frameworks seeking to explain cognitive flexibility

There are multiple theoretical frameworks trying to explain it:
- the **cognitive flexibility theory** suggests that mental flexibility arises from the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and *activate alternative responses* based on feedback and context.
	- This seems very interesting, like to examine this a bit more. It seems related to [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual process model]].
- The **set-shifting theory** proposes that mental flexibility involves the ability to disengage from a current set of mental operations and switch to a new set of operations.
	- Would it be the ability to learn when to apply different [[_MOC Mental Models|mental models]]?
- The **task-switching theory** suggests that mental flexibility arises from the ability to activate and maintain multiple task sets and switch between them.

## Why is mental flexibility important?

Mental flexibility is important because it allows us to adapt to new situations, solve problems and make creative ideas. It allows us to [[Mental cost of context switching|shift our attention]], change our [[Stages involved in behavioral change|behavior]] and adjust our mental models as necessary. According to scientific evidence, mental flexibility is a correlated to a wide range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes such as academic achievement, social skills and [[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health|mental health]].

See associated papers to [[REF Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility - PubMed]].

## Mindfulness can grant cognitive flexibility

According to [[REF Meditation, mindfulness and cognitive flexibility - PubMed|the paper "Meditation mindfulness and cognitive flexibility"]], one can learn to cultivate the capability for [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] through [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] which would allow someone to develop the capacity for [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|non-judgement]].

## The opposite of mental flexibility is being close-minded

Being close minded means the opposite of being mentally flexible. It is someone who **is resistant to new ideas, perspectives or experiences**. Some people may even define themselves as stubborn or hide under the veil of [[Skepticism is keeping the door open to new ideas|skepticism]] in order to resist [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]].

### A person may reject new ideas for multiple reasons

However, one possible explanation of what is perceived as being close-minded might be a difference in [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|communication]]. Perhaps I am not speaking their language and using the appropriate metaphors. [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|Don't be so critical]].

Some people may not be in a position to be open to new ideas or it may not be aligned with their [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values]].

### Close-mindedness makes it difficult to accept new ideas

A close-minded person may have a [[Fixed mindset|fixed mindset]] and be reluctant to having their thoughts challenged or revise them in the face of [[Learning new things is often difficult|new information]]. Often the best ideas are learned when one is able to challenge one's preconceptions including [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|biases]].  An educated mind would understand that [[Knowledge is a gift|knowledge is a gift]]. And that the best ideas are often found on the cutting [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|edge of knowledge]] - what may seem common, uncommon, contradictory or paradoxical - but that is how [[science progresses through the principles of falsifiability|science progresses through the principles of falsifiability]]. We move forward and

I somewhat understand this perspective though due to [[Data Explosion|information explosion]]. It can be more comfortable and simply reject new ideas and cling to what we currently believe. However, with  [[Half-life of knowledge and its decay|information decay]] and the [[Firehose of Falsehood|firehose of falsehood]] - it's just overwhelming.

### Little time to gather information and learn

But we also know about [[Information overconsumption|focus on high quality information]] rather than avoiding it outright. I don't know why but it seems surprising to people that in general, I prefer consuming non-fiction books over fiction. Some have even criticized me that I may be leaving the arts and my emotional side behind by pursuing said reading. Or perhaps it is not of high quality. What's the alternative I ask?

### Prioritizing being correct over finding truth

### Learning to change an ingrained belief requires time and patience

According to the video on [[Skepticism is keeping the door open to new ideas|skepticism]], it might take about two years for someone to reevaluate a deeply  ingrained belief.

## Cognitive or mental flexibility as a cognitive ability

> Mental flexibility is a cognitive ability that refers to the capacity to switch one's thinking between different concepts, perspectives, or strategies in response to changing situational demands. In scientific theory, mental flexibility is often considered as a component of executive functioning, which involves higher-order cognitive processes that help individuals regulate their thoughts, actions, and emotions to achieve their goals.
>
> Mental flexibility is crucial for adapting to new situations, solving problems, and generating creative ideas. It allows individuals to shift their attention, modify their behavior, and adjust their mental sets as necessary. Research has shown that mental flexibility is related to a wide range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes, such as academic achievement, social skills, and mental health.
>
> Several theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain the cognitive mechanisms underlying mental flexibility. For example, the cognitive flexibility theory suggests that mental flexibility arises from the ability to inhibit prepotent responses and activate alternative responses based on feedback and context. The set-shifting theory proposes that mental flexibility involves the ability to disengage from a current set of mental operations and switch to a new set of operations. The task-switching theory suggests that mental flexibility arises from the ability to activate and maintain multiple task sets and switch between them.
>
> Overall, mental flexibility is a complex and multifaceted cognitive ability that plays a critical role in various aspects of human functioning, and its study is an active area of research in cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and related fields.

### Mental flexibility is the antithesis of being close-minded

> Mental flexibility is opposite to being close-minded. Being close-minded means having a rigid or inflexible mindset that is resistant to new ideas, perspectives, or experiences. A close-minded person tends to have a fixed belief system that is not open to challenge or revision, and may be dismissive of views that contradict their own. This can lead to a lack of curiosity, a resistance to change, and an inability to see things from different angles or consider alternative solutions to problems.
>
> In contrast, mental flexibility involves the ability to consider different perspectives, weigh the evidence objectively, and adapt one's thinking as [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|new information]] becomes available. It requires a willingness to consider new ideas and experiences, to question one's assumptions and biases, and to be open to change and growth.
>
> In summary, being close-minded is the opposite of mental flexibility, as it refers to a rigid and inflexible mindset that is resistant to new ideas and perspectives, while mental flexibility involves the ability to adapt one's thinking and behavior in response to changing circumstances.

## Difference between being close-minded and skepticism

> While being close-minded refers to having a rigid and inflexible mindset that is resistant to new ideas, skepticism refers to a questioning attitude or a critical evaluation of claims and evidence. Skepticism involves the willingness to consider alternative explanations and to withhold belief until there is sufficient evidence to support a claim.
>
> In other words, skepticism is not the same as being close-minded, because it is a rational and evidence-based approach to evaluating information, rather than a rigid and dogmatic mindset that is resistant to new ideas. Skepticism involves a healthy dose of doubt and critical thinking, but it is also open to new information and willing to revise its conclusions based on evidence.
>
> To further differentiate between being close-minded and skepticism, consider the following examples:
>
> -   A close-minded person might reject a new idea or claim without considering any evidence, simply because it contradicts their existing beliefs or worldview.
> -   A skeptical person, on the other hand, would carefully evaluate the evidence for the new idea or claim, and withhold belief until there is sufficient evidence to support it.
> -   A close-minded person might dismiss alternative viewpoints or perspectives without considering their merits, simply because they are unfamiliar or uncomfortable.
> -   A skeptical person, in contrast, would be willing to consider alternative viewpoints, and evaluate them based on their evidence and logic.
>
> Overall, while being close-minded and skepticism can both involve a degree of doubt and critical thinking, they differ in their willingness to [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|consider alternative perspectives]] and evidence. Skepticism is a more open-minded and evidence-based approach to evaluating information, while being close-minded involves a rigid and inflexible mindset that is resistant to new ideas.

## Rejecting ideas without gathering further information

> A person who always rejects ideas without being fully informed because they have not seen the methodology can be described as closed-minded or skeptical in a negative sense.
>
> While skepticism can be a healthy and rational approach to evaluating ideas, a person who consistently rejects ideas without being fully informed is not engaging in constructive skepticism. Instead, they may be demonstrating a bias or a lack of willingness to [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|consider alternative perspectives]], which can limit their ability to learn and grow.
>
> Such a person may also be described as dogmatic, which means holding onto a belief or idea without being willing to consider alternative viewpoints or evidence. Dogmatism can be a hindrance to critical thinking and open-mindedness, as it prevents a person from considering new ideas and revising their beliefs based on evidence.
>
> In summary, a person who always rejects ideas without being fully informed because they have not seen the methodology can be described as closed-minded, skeptical in a negative sense, or dogmatic. These terms reflect a lack of willingness to [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|consider alternative perspectives]] or evidence, which can limit their ability to learn and grow.

## Practice mental flexibility

### Eli5 explanation of of the passage of an educated mind

When it comes to the nature of certain fields, we should try to keep that in mind when trying to determine the truth. Some fields which are more abstract, or depend less on 'objectivity' (see also [[The impossibility of conveying objective truth]]) require us to consider their vague nature while others should have a higher burden of proofs to make a point.

An educated person should be able to critically think (see [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]]) and adjust expectations based on the subject we're dealing with.

### Complex explanation of the passage of an educated mind

In Book I, Chapter 3 of Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle aims to establish the appropriate level of precision that one should expect from different fields of study or disciplines. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing that the level of exactness or certainty that can be achieved in each subject is determined by the nature of the subject itself.

Aristotle argues that it is the mark of an educated person to seek precision in each discipline only to the extent that the subject allows. He provides two examples to illustrate this point:

1.  It would be foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician because mathematics is a field that relies on exactness and rigorous proofs. In mathematics, one should expect precise and demonstrable results.
2.  Conversely, it would be unreasonable to demand scientific proofs from a rhetorician, as rhetoric is a discipline that deals with persuasion and argumentation, where absolute certainty is not always achievable. In rhetoric, one should expect persuasive arguments that appeal to probability rather than strict proof.

In essence, Aristotle is encouraging intellectual discernment and an understanding of the limitations and strengths of different disciplines. An educated person should be able to determine the appropriate level of certainty or proof required for a given subject and adapt their expectations accordingly. This demonstrates a flexible and nuanced approach to knowledge, allowing individuals to engage with various fields of study effectively and responsibly.

## The original passage of an educated mind

> [!NOTE] Book I, Chapter 3
> Our discussion will be adequate if it has as much clearness as the subject-matter admits of, for precision is not to be sought for alike in all discussions, any more than in all the products of the crafts. Now fine and just actions, which political science investigates, admit of much variety and fluctuation of opinion, so that they may be thought to exist only by convention, and not by nature. And goods also give rise to a similar fluctuation because they bring harm to many people; for before now men have been undone by reason of their wealth, and others by reason of their courage. We must be content, then, in speaking of such subjects and with such premisses to indicate the truth roughly and in outline, and in speaking about things which are only for the most part true and with premisses of the same kind to reach conclusions that are no better. In the same spirit, therefore, should each type of statement be received; for it is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs.
>
> Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a good judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that occur in life, but its discussions start from these and are about these; and, further, since he tends to follow his passions, his study will be vain and unprofitable, because the end aimed at is not knowledge but action. And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living, and pursuing each successive object, as passion directs. For to such persons, as to the incontinent, knowledge brings no profit; but to those who desire and act in accordance with a rational principle knowledge about such matters will be of great benefit.
>
> These remarks about the student, the sort of treatment to be expected, and the purpose of the inquiry, may be taken as our preface.

This is considered one of the most accurate translations.

### The educated mind passage is often too simplified

> [!quote] The mark of an educated mind
> *"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it"*
> \- (Supposedly )Aristotle
>
> Turns out it's a [bastardization](https://sententiaeantiquae.com/2018/09/22/nope-aristotle-did-not-say-it-is-the-mark-of-an-educated-mind-to-entertain-a-thought-without/) of Book 1, chapter 3 of "Nicomachean Ethics" by Aristotle and doesn't fully capture the idea.

> [!AI] Chat-GPT4
> Aristotle's quote about entertaining a thought is often paraphrased as "It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it." However, this exact wording does not appear in any of Aristotle's known works. The quote is a loose interpretation of a passage from his work "Nicomachean Ethics," specifically Book I, Chapter 3. In this passage, Aristotle discusses the importance of considering different opinions and recognizing that exactness is not always possible.
>
> Here is a more accurate translation of the relevant passage from Nicomachean Ethics (translated by W.D. Ross):
>
> "It is the mark of an educated man to look for precision in each class of things just so far as the nature of the subject admits; it is evidently equally foolish to accept probable reasoning from a mathematician and to demand from a rhetorician scientific proofs."
>
> This passage highlights the importance of understanding the limitations of different fields of knowledge and adjusting one's expectations accordingly. Although not an exact match to the paraphrased quote, it still conveys the idea of appreciating different perspectives and not blindly accepting every argument presented.

That can be okay…it provides a mental model and [[The map is not the territory|simplifying]] something isn't necessarily bad - as long as it's actionable.
