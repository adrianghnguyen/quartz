# Disabilities and developmental gaps in gifted children

Gifted children or those with HPI who have developmental struggles, such as ADHD,  may suffer from twice/double exceptionalism which leaves them at great risk of falling behind or struggle in society.

If there is an environmental gap between the child and their environment, we may refer to these as asynchronicity. This can occur at the family, school or social level.

## Twice exceptionalism of HPI aka double exceptionality

### Combination of developmental issues along with HPI

> [!NOTE] Twice Exceptionalism in French
> ["Double exceptionnalité"](https://ciddt.ca/double-exceptionnalite/)
HPI without 'difficulties' is a source of strength.

However, those with very high HPI and *double exceptionalism* ([[ADHD]], learning difficulties, autism spectrum disorder, mental health issues such as [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]], [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] and depression) are more susceptible to risks of *academic difficulties as well as psychological issues*. As a result, [[Personal reflections on HPI|HPI]] may become a source of vulnerability. HPI can become a double-edged sword in this scenario for these children.

## Developmental gap between multiple spheres of development in gifted children

### Asynchronicity in gifted children

When there's a delay between multiple spheres of development in gifted children. These tend to happen at the [[Personality is shaped our environment|environment]] level.

- Academic settings gap
- Social gap
- Familial gap

I didn't bother explaining social or academic setting gap as it isn't relevant to me.

#### Familial gap in gifted children and their family explained further

One of the most important protective factor for the HPI child. It's where the [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]], talent, passion, etc. is most developed.

If the **familial environment is poor**, which can be common in immigrant families with [[generational trauma]], it may lead to issues concerning [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|one's identity]], [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] and [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]].
