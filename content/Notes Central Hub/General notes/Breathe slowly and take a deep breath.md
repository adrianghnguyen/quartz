# Breathe slowly and take a deep breath.

#status/done

Related to [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness]]

I remember with my previous therapist, she made me use this breath measuring device.

From what I recall, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxious people]] perceive constant threats and may engage in shallow breathing, most likely part of their [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stress response getting ready to deal with the threat]].

## Slow breathing is one breath per 6 seconds

It can also be known as the boxed breathing technique:

- They've observed links between the [[Mind-body connection|brain-body]] interaction during [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] and relaxing practices of slowing down one's breath
- We haven't yet been able to establish physiological mechanisms explaining how there are psychophysiological mechanisms of slow breathing techniques
- Slow breathing is defined as <10 breaths per minute, or **one breath per 6 seconds** is an important practice in [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] techniques
	- Breathe in for 4 seconds
	- Breathe out for 4 seconds

See [[REF Psychophysiological effects of Slow Breathing]] to learn more about current research on the topic.

> [!question]
> Any links to mindful breathing affecting [[HRV Frequency Measurements|HRV]]? I think it slows down our heart rate. Is this a two way process? Using higher level thinking and executive functions, we can regulate our heartbeat in order to soothe the [[Sympathetic Nervous System|sympathetic nervous system]].

## The joy of breathing slowly brings me contentment

I feel that when I breathe slowly and I really focus on the movement of the breath, it brings a sense of peace and contentment, similar to [[The Happiness Equation|happiness]], and I feel like it helps me [[Stay grounded and maintain perspective|stay grounded in the moment]] rather than going over to anxious thoughts. It's also helping me [[Somatic therapy|connect with my body]] a bit more.

After a short while of engaging in this exercise, I feel like a sense of calm washes over me. My brain does feel like it is switching modesâ€¦perhaps moving closer to [[Unification of mind|unification of consciousness]]?
