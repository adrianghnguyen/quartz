It is based off this research paper called [Strengths of character, orientations to happiness, and life satisfaction: The Journal of Positive Psychology: Vol 2, No 3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760701228938) that was published in 2007.

Virtue is important for a good life and flourishing. Marty Seligman and Chris Peterson identified six domains of character virtues with around 24 character strengths.

Aristotle thought that personal flourishing required eudaimonia, but this research shows that there might be another way for us to achieve it through aligning our work with our virtues.
