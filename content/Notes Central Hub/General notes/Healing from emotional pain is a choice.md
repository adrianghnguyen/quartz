![[_HL Come as You Are by Emily Nagoski#^ref-32804]]

As we go through everyday life, there are many things which are going to [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|hurt our feelings]]. However, we can change our [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|attitude towards these feelings of pain]], and this affects our mood or perception. In order to get over it, we need to practice an attitude of mindfulness or [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|being kind towards our feelings]].

This can be difficult at times when we've experienced trauma which distorts how we perceive the world and it will [[Perception aka Mood|affect our mood]] as a consequence. [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|We might feel ourselves becoming very defensive]] and [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|perceiving many things as threats, leading to high stress]].

But it's important to be kind towards ourselves in this time and realize that when we heal from the pain, it can lead to [[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|post-traumatic growth]], which has many benefits of making us a stronger person and learning new coping skills.

When it comes to [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|early emotional wounds]] such as those from our childhood, [[Adult relationships can cure childhood wounds|adult relationships can help us overcome early emotional pains experience in early life]].

## Knowing we are healing from the past 

We have healed from the past when becomes information becomes neutral and we are no longer as reactive. There's distance and time to look calmly as what has happened. We can accept the hurt, but we are able to see that it no longer defines our personal futures. 

If I understand the goal of therapy and healing from trauma correctly, past traumatic memories have hijacked or [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|intuition (or system 1) thinking]] responses. We are then learning to [[Neuroplasticity|rewire these neural responses]] using present experiences using [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|System 2 or explicit reasoning]].

> “You are on a path of healing when your past becomes information with nonneutral energy, and it doesn’t define you,” says Monroe.

This can be challenging we are stuck in our [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|internal narratives]] of [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional hurt]] to know if we are healing from the past. I still deal with many remnans of the past in terms of [[Attachment wounds and trauma|attachment trauma]] and my [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|early emotional wounds]]. 

But apparently, here's how to tell when I am [[Moving on from the past|moving on from the past]]:
- I feel safe in my body - there is no constant state of high anxiety, dread or fear
- I can set [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|personal boundaries]]
- I can learn to trust [[Gut feelings|my intuition]]
- My personal behaviour is consistent with my personal values and beliefs - see also [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|Values guide our behaviour like a lighthouse.]]
- I respond rather than react to situations - there is [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]] in play
