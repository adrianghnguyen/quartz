## Curiosity is a fundamental need and can be interrupted by stress

"[[My core values define what matters|Curiosity]] (or “Exploration” or “Seeking”) is, like sex, a basic biological [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|motivational system]]."^[In comparative psychology, the phenomenon of curiosity is studied as “Exploration,” per Toates, Biological Psychology, 404–6, or “SEEKING,” per Panksepp and Bevin, Archaeology of Mind, chapter 3.] as said in [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]. [[Working memory is limited|Working memory is limited]] and when we are [[Stress response system lifecycle|stressed out]], curiosity and our ability to engage in creativity also becomes limited.

When we are [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxious]] or [[Depression|depressed]], we will become less curious about novelty, and we will seek interest in becoming comfortable or familiar environment instead. As a result, some people may choose poor coping [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|responses]] in order to re-establish the familiar^[Toates, Biological Psychology.] similar to the [[REF Emotional environments retune the valence of appetitive versus fearful functions in nucleus accumbens|iggy pop experiment with rats]].

When we are calm, most things will make us curious and think of the question, **"what's this?"**. We will learn to explore. On the other hand, when we are in a [[Stress response system lifecycle|stressed state of mind]], nothing will make us curious.
