# Expedient friendships are transactional and utility-based

#status/done

Related to [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function]]

Expedient friendships are friendships based on utility. These are people we call upon with a specific need, whether it be business, career or a specific ambition.  The core benefit of the relationships is more than camaraderie but they also bring the least to our overall well-being and life quality.

In this type of relationship, the emotional bonds are weakest and the happiness benefits are lowest. These types of friendships are based on utility to each other in work or social life. We might be people who are colleagues, superiors or partners to a transaction, or people who can do favors for one another.

According to [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|Aristotle]], they are the lowest [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|level of friendship]] and are based on give and take.
