## What is oxytocin?

It's a key neuropeptide, a type of neurotransmitter and hormone, within the the brain, involved in [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|trust]], love and [[Human cooperation theory|cooperation]]. [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Dr. Paul Zak]] helped found the field of [[neuroeconomics helps us understand how brains make decisions|neuroeconomics]] and is one of the leading researchers on the subject of oxytocin.

### What is a neuropeptide?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> A neuropeptide is a small protein molecule that functions as a neurotransmitter in the brain and nervous system. Neuropeptides are involved in a wide range of physiological processes, including pain perception, appetite regulation, and social behavior. They are synthesized in neurons and released into the synaptic cleft to bind to specific receptors on target cells, where they can modulate cellular activity and influence behavior. Oxytocin is one example of a neuropeptide that is involved in social bonding, trust, and happiness.

## Neuroscience of oxytocin

It's an ancient chemical that's developed in the brainstem and is outside of conscious awareness, a common characteristic of mammals. It's linked to behaviors of breastfeed and childbirth which are initiated in the [[peripheral nervous system|peripheral nervous system]]. Essentially, human brains have a nerve anatomy, which is developed to promote social living.

We have many of these receptors for oxytocin within the frontal cortex %%(same thing as [[Prefrontal Cortex|Prefrontal cortex]]?)%%  which allows humans to be unconscious and acutely aware of those with whom we want to be around, associate with and wish to avoid such as [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict people]].

As a result, oxytocin plays a big role in deciding in which [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|communities in wish we wish to embed ourselves in to increase our life satisfaction]]. When we find someone interesting, it's the release of oxytocin which makes us want to spend time with and get to know the other person more. The larger the network of oxytocin activation, the greater our sense of empathy.

> Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the pituitary gland. It plays a crucial role in social bonding and maternal behaviors, including childbirth, lactation, and maternal-infant attachment. It is also involved in sexual pleasure and [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension|orgasm]], as well as social behaviors such as trust, [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|empathy]], and generosity.

> Oxytocin levels increase during physical touch, especially during skin-to-skin contact with a partner or baby, and can have calming effects on the body and mind.

## Oxytocin is released during physical and eye contact

Research shows that oxytocin is released when we make eye contact and physical contact with one another. It requires an embrace of about 20 seconds to maximize its effect. It does not need to be romantic or even human.

It also applies to pets - Research shows that canines and humans evolved in parallel making us feel love in the same way neurochemically.

This would help explain the [[Baby Rhesus Monkey Experiment|baby rhesus monkey experiment]] and how lack of emotional touch/love from one's parent can be so damaging.

## Benefits of oxytocin release

It helps counteract the effects of [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stressful experiences]] where [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] may be release and helps create sensations of relaxation, [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|trust]], and [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|bonding]].

> 1. Increased feelings of love and bonding: Oxytocin is often referred to as the "love hormone" because it plays a crucial role in promoting social bonding and attachment. When released, it can increase feelings of trust, empathy, and affection towards others.
> 2. Reduced stress and anxiety: Oxytocin can also help to reduce stress levels by lowering cortisol production, the hormone associated with stress. This can lead to a greater sense of calm and relaxation.
> 3. Improved sexual function: Oxytocin is also involved in sexual arousal and orgasm. When released during sexual activity, it can enhance feelings of pleasure and intimacy.
> 4. Enhanced social skills: Oxytocin has been shown to improve social skills such as communication, empathy, and [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional intelligence]]. This can lead to stronger relationships and better overall mental health.
> 5. Pain relief: Oxytocin has been found to have pain-relieving properties, particularly during childbirth. It can also help to alleviate other types of pain by reducing inflammation.
> Overall, the release of oxytocin has numerous benefits for both physical and mental health, promoting feelings of love, trust, relaxation, and well-being.

## Monitoring oxytocin levels to understand trust

According to the research by [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Paul Zak]] in [[neuroeconomics helps us understand how brains make decisions|neuroeconomics]], they discovered that we could monitor oxytocin levels to understand how likely we are to a cooperate or trust a stranger.
This would allow us to gauge if someone is trustworthy or safe to interact with - aka lower [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response]] levels.

That helps us understand the good side of human behavior, such as why we connect, why we sacrifice to help strangers, why we care about others. It was something that was poorly understood for a while.

## What increases levels of oxytocin in the body?

Humans are emotional creatures and as such social connections and activities cause us to emotionally connect with others and release oxytocin. This runs along a continuum, so the proximity of the relationship or the closeness of the relationship affects how much we release it.

Oxytocin has a short half-life as a signaling molecule. Extended release would cause us to misidentify threats such as a robber.

### Factors affecting level of oxytocin release

1. Our level of unconscious attachment to the other person. A close loved one like a family member would make us a lot more happy than an acquaintance.
2. Our level of stress. when we are [[Stress response system lifecycle|stressed out]], we are in a mode of survival and are most likely releasing testosterone which is an inhibitor to oxytocin release
3. Activities with high levels of competition - particularly with groups of males. We will often see less bonding, less cooperation according to [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Paul Zak]]. This is heightened in young males who are more likely to commit crime.

We should remember to [[Treat poor behaviour with kindness|be kind to others having a bad day]].

## Loneliness and oxytocin

Related to [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|need to belong]]

The sense of loneliness is felt when we feel uncomfortable, or we do not have enough oxytocin.

The opposite of oxytocin release would be a de-adaptation and causes us to turn inwards towards selfish behaviours - seems like something which is supported by the [[Theory of basic human values|theory of basic human values]]. It causes us to have more difficulty on building social connections.

Loneliness degrades our quality of life, but also degrades our health. One of the primary factors with drive long term life satisfaction and happiness is our ability to gain benefits from social interactions.

People who have many social connections get the opportunity to have oxytocin release, which helps reduce their stress response and improves our immune system. As as a result, they are happier but also physically healthier.
