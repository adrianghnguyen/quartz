# Rumination also known as negative repetitive thoughts

Rumination is engaging in a repetitive negative thought process loop. This can be distressing, difficult to stop and involves **repeating a negative thought or [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|trying to avoid a problem]].** It is an unobservable internal process.

This can be bad for one's mental health as it places a burden on one's [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|ability to concentrate]]  It tends to be co-occurring with [[Depression|depression]] and [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]].

Also see: [[The difference between anxiety and rumination|The difference between anxiety and rumination]].

This feeling also means you might start to doubt yourself and your decision-making ability. It can be hard to concentrate or make decisions when you’re overthinking, as your mind is constantly racing. It also might stop you from taking risks or trying [[Learning new things is often difficult|new things]], as you’re so worried about what could go wrong.^[https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/anxiety-and-overthinking/]

[[The philosophical source of boredom|Restlessness]] is your mind trying to outpace your body gathering additional information or [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|processing its sensations of stress]]. Perhaps there is a relationship with the [[Mind-body connection|mind-body connection]] which is being hijacked through overstimulation of threats and [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]]. In order to help resolve the [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|source of the problem]],  we need to pinpoint the source of distress of our [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feelings]].

## Examples of rumination

- Worrying about a **future** event
- Replaying a past scenario
- Trying to predict how something will play out
- Feelings of [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|worthlessness]]

 - “How do I find more meaning if nothing has any purpose?"
 - "If nothing is meaningful, then why do anything at all?"
 - "Why are we even really alive?” ^why-alive

These are all examples of [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological impasse]]. If nothing seems meaningful, perhaps we need to search for our [[Vision as deep personal expression|personal vision]]. Remember that [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|we derive meaning in moments of suffering]].

## Why do we ruminate?

It is a form of mental compulsion - the mental equivalent of OCD where it is an [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|intrusive thought]] or obsession due to a certain distress factor. It can feel like it is out of control, like it is occurring within the moment. Often one cannot tell they are ruminating until they are in the rabbit hole. This requires deep [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|personal insight]] to realize when we are within this pattern[^1]

## How to get out of a rumination spiral?

1. Identify themes of the [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] spiral
2. Accept the themes as unknowable answers or repetitive patterns and recognize it as part of the [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]]
	1. “This is a familiar pattern; I tend to over analyze past social situations. I can’t possibly know what someone else was thinking so it’s not helpful to keeping replaying this”
3. Recognize that rumination is not problem-solving.
	1. Problem solving and planning are [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|active mental health coping strategies]]
	2. Remove [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|sources of stress]]
	3. [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|Be proactive when it comes to stress]]

Dr. Martin Seligman believes we should be called Homo prospectus because [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|we can think and plan for the future.]]  Planning can be important for family life, business, and personal success and happiness. However, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|Thinking too much about the future]] can prevent us from [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|being present in the moment]] and enjoying life.
