> Mental models are frameworks or representations that individuals use to understand and interpret the world around them. They are like internal maps that shape our thoughts, beliefs, and actions. Mental models help us make sense of complex information by simplifying it and organizing it into categories or patterns. They influence how we perceive and interact with reality, as well as how we problem-solve and make decisions. Developing and refining our mental models can enhance our understanding and ability to navigate the world effectively.

Mental models are a way of representing how something work using your existing knowledge as integrated into our [[Brains organize information into schemas|personal schemas]]. It can be multiple things which we've learned such as concepts, theories, frameworks or beliefs which **help us understand the world**.

However, mental models can often be reductive because they don't capture the nuance of a complete concept but that's missing the point. [[The map is not the territory|The map is not the territory.]]. It's a tool for making decisions and help us boil down complexities of the world as human processing information is [[Working memory is limited|limited by our working memory]].

They don't need to be perfect, they just need to be good enough because [[Half-life of knowledge and its decay|knowledge keeps evolving]] and thus our mental models need to evolve to compete with an everchanging world. That's why [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|a philosophy of accelerated learning philosophy]] can help us remain competitive.

## Make better decisions by choosing the right mental model and slowing down thinking as appropriate

The only times we should [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.|think of slowing down]] to [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gather information]]  is when there is something which is life-threatening or critically important to our life goals or values.

It's important to establish a cut off of when we should [[Make quick and decisive actions|move into action]] and [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|Do the thing instead of passive learning]]. Otherwise, it is easy to succumb [[analysis paralysis]].

However, at other times, we need to [[Being patient leads to better decisions|practice patience to make better decisions]].
