> [!quote] Heisenberg uncertainty principle
> The position and the [velocity](https://www.britannica.com/science/velocity) of an object cannot both be measured exactly, at the same time, even in theory. The very concepts of exact position and exact velocity together, in fact, have no meaning in nature. This is a theory presented by [Werner Heisenberg](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Werner-Heisenberg)
