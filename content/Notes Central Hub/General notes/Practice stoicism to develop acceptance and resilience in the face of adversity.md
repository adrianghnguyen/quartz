Stoicism is a philosophy that emphasizes that we should learn to [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|control our emotions]] to [[The Happiness Equation|lead a happy life]]. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is often filled with uncertainty]]. It is quite similar to the [[Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happen|Eastern philosophy of acceptance aka Wu-Wei]].

According to the [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|happiness portfolio model]], 25% of how happy we are is through our direct choices while the remaining 75% is born out of circumstances.

The foundational beliefs of stoicism are the following:
1. [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|Acceptance in the face of life]]
2. Pursue a life in accordance with virtue rather than [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|pleasure or material success]]
3. Emotions should be guided by reason rather than [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|instinct or impulse]]. We always have the [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|opportunity to step back]] and examine how we wish to reaction.

The goal of such scholars such as [[Meditations by Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] is to help us learn develop a mindset of less reactivity and increasing our [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional resilience]]. In the modern world, there are often [[Invisible lions of stress|invisible lions of stress]] and these mental development practices can help us [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|let go]] of [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|unnecessary stress and frustration]].

Practicing stoicism can help us develop [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional intelligence]], [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|self-discipline to develop our willpower]], and [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|approach life with gratitude]]. It can help us let go of [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|negative thoughts and emotions]] and focus on [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]].

It's quite similar to the Eastern philosophy message of [[Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happen|Wu-Wei and the art of letting things happen]].

According to Stoic philosophy, we should strive pursue a [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaningful life]] rather than that of [[The Happiness Equation|mere pleasure]].
## Practice stoicism to deal with difficult situations and feelings

### Accept difficult feelings

Difficult feelings are a normal [[Understanding the complexity of life|normal part of life]] so stoicism recommends that we approach it with acceptance and [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|accept them as inevitable]]. It is not the events in themselves which cause [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|suffering]] but rather our attitude and subsequent actions towards them. 

Maybe treating ourselves with compassion can help us [[Tong-Len philosophy is exchanging hurt for empathy|exchange hurt for empathy]] when it comes to difficult feelings as a result of other people.

### Control your reactions

We cannot always control external events but we do have [[inner locus of control|control over our own thoughts and actions]]. It can be as simple as learning to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|acknowledge emotions]]. It can also mean that from there, we can use an [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive coping style]] to respond to difficult feelings and [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|sources of stress]].

### Practice mindfulness to understand the nature of our emotions

We should [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|practice mindfulness to observe and understand our emotions]] [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|without judgment]]. From there, we can [[Building resilience requires self-acceptance|cultivate resilience by accepting the origins of our feelings]].

### Engage in perspective shift

Stoics advise taking a broader perspective on life in realizing that emotions are [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|impermanent]] within the [[Understanding the complexity of life|bigger picture of life]].  This too shall pass. [[View challenges as opportunities|View challenges as opportunities]].

We can learn to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe our perspectives]].

### Negative visualization

Negative visualization: Stoics recommend practicing negative visualization, which involves deliberately contemplating worst-case scenarios to gain perspective on one's fears or anxieties. By preparing for hardships mentally, individuals can reduce the impact of difficult emotions when they actually occur.

### Pursue a life with the pursuit of virtue ethics

Virtue ethics: Stoicism places significant importance on living a virtuous life. By focusing on cultivating virtues such as wisdom, courage, justice, and self-control, individuals can develop resilience in dealing with difficult emotions.
