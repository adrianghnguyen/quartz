PERMA is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|model]] of well-being by Professor Martin Seligman, who is one of the founders of [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]]. The PERMA model allow us to focus our attention and [[Habits for creating long-term happiness|engage in positive habits]] in specific areas.

He suggests that [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]] is made up of five different pillars which spells out PERMA:

1. Positive emotions - This is more than happiness and includes emotions such as hope, joy, love, etc. which are core components of [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]]
2. Engagement
3. Relationships
4. Meaning
5. Accomplishments

This [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] is useful because it helps us identify concrete areas of [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal improvement]] and what we can improve when we are [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|designing our happiest life]]. Oftentimes we are told that when we are not doing well in life, we should go and do something which [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|makes us feel better]] - but that's ill defined or unclear or makes us feel lost.

## P – Positive Emotions

> Positive Emotion is much more than happiness. Positive emotions include hope, joy, love, compassion, amusement, and gratitude. Positive emotions are a prime indicator of [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|flourishing]] (Fredrickson, 2001) and can be cultivated. However, this does not mean we need to [[Emotional suppression and denial|repress negative emotions]]. Instead, we can [[Emotion coaching is accepting all feelings and working through them|accept all emotional experiences]] but [[Happiness requires action|expose ourselves to situations where positive emotions arise naturally]].

## E – Engagement

> According to Seligman, engagement is being one with the music (2012). Engagement is similar to the [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|concept of flow]]. It refers to a loss of self-consciousness and complete absorption in an activity. It is mindfully focusing on the task at hand.

## R – Relationships

> Relationships encompass all the interactions individuals have with partners, friends, [[The value of family|family members]], and their community at large. This part of the model refers to feeling supported, loved, and valued by others.

## M – Meaning

> Meaning is defined as belonging and serving something greater than ourselves. Having a purpose helps individuals focus on what is important in the face of significant challenges or adversity (Seligman, 2012).
