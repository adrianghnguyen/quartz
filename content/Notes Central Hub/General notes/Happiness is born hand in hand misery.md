It's a common misconception that removing negative feelings will lead to an increase in positive feelings. The mere absence of misery leaves one empty as a person.

The truth is that happiness is not the absence of misery. If we focus on getting someone get rid of their sadness, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] and [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|anger]], we do not get a happy person. Rather, we just get someone who is empty (possible relationship to [[Running on Empty by Jonice Webb|Running on Empty by Jonice Webb]]?).

Researchers have found that [[Happiness and unhappiness are processed in different parts of the brain|happiness and unhappiness are processed in different parts of the brain]].
