## Mindfulness helps us process trauma

> Without ever addressing the [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] directly, you can simply begin practicing [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]], and gradually the trauma will work its way out, like shrapnel from an old wound.
>
> There are spectacular books on the practice of mindfulness. One of my favorites is The Mindful Way through Depression by Mark Williams, John Teasdale, Zindel Segal, and Jon Kabat-Zinn. Don’t let the “through depression” part throw you; it’s a practical guide to managing [[View challenges as opportunities|any uncomfortable emotional experience]].

## Trauma-informed mindfulness

> “Trauma often lives on in the mind and body in painful ways,” Treleaven says. “We might have [intrusive thoughts or memories](https://psychcentral.com/lib/coping-with-flashbacks) of a trauma, or painful sensations that just don’t go away.”

This is an approach to mindfulness which encourages people to sustain direct attention towards the trauma and experiences that come out of it. It can help individuals cope with [[post-traumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]] by taking a [[Approaches to therapy|sideways based approach to therapy]]. 

However, it's important to note that this can exacerbate feelings of distress and anxiety in people because it brings up a lot of strong emotions. So in a way, it can worsen our symptoms and cause triggers if we are not cautious.

> I don't think the advice was as pertinent to me. The main takeaway of this trauma informed mindfulness seems to be about not triggering the patient and making them feel overwhelmed by using grounding techniques. I'm not sure if this is really relevant to me since I don't really feel overwhelmed with feelings necessarily.

## How to practice mindfulness

From [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

Here’s the short version of how to [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|practice]] mindfulness:

| Summary                                                                                                            | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start with two minutes.                                                                                            | For two minutes a day, direct your attention to your breath: the way the air comes into your body and your chest and belly expand, and the way the breath leaves your body and your chest and belly deflate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Let your mind wander - which is normal                                      | That’s normal. That’s healthy. That’s actually the point. Notice that your mind wandered, let those extraneous thoughts go—you can return to them as soon as the two minutes are up—and allow your attention to return to your breath.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Return your focus when you see it wander and focus on your breath | It’s not so much about paying attention to your breath as it is about noticing what you’re paying attention to without judgment, and making a choice about whether you want to pay attention to it. What you’re “mindful” of is both your breath and your attention to your breath. By practicing this skill of noticing what you’re paying attention to, you are teaching yourself to be in control of your brain, so that your brain is not in control of you. |

> This regular two-minute practice will gradually result in periodic moments throughout the day when you notice what you’re paying attention to and then decide if that’s what you want to pay attention to right now, or if you want to pay attention to something else. What you pay attention to matters less than how you pay attention.
>
> This is a sideways strategy for weeding trauma out of your garden. It’s a way of simply noticing a weed and then deciding if you want to water it or not, pull it or not, fertilize it or not. The weed of trauma will gradually disappear as long as at least half the time you choose not to nurture it. And the more you choose to withdraw your protection from the trauma, the faster it will wither and die.
>
> Mindfulness is good for everyone and everything. It is to your mind what exercise and green vegetables are to your body. If you change only one thing in your life as a result of reading this book, make it this daily two-minute practice. The practice grants the opportunity to “cultivate deep respect for emotions,” differentiating their causes from their effects and granting you choice over how you manage them
