> In the context of [[Dynamic systems theory|dynamic systems theory]] and related approaches, self-organization refers to the process by which complex patterns of behavior or structure emerge spontaneously from the interactions between multiple factors. **Self-organization can be thought of as a kind of "bottom-up" process, in which complex behavior or structure emerges from the interactions of many simple parts or processes.**

> Self-organization is thought to occur when *a system is far from equilibrium*, meaning that it is not in a steady state or at rest, but is instead [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|constantly changing]] and evolving over time. In this state, the system is sensitive to [[Incremental change|small changes]] in its environment, and even small perturbations can lead to large changes in the behavior or structure of the system.

> Self-organization is a ubiquitous phenomenon that can be observed in many different domains, including physical systems, biological systems, and social systems. For example, the formation of snowflakes, the behavior of flocks of birds or schools of fish, and the emergence of language in human societies are all examples of self-organization.

> Self-organization is an important concept in dynamic systems theory and related approaches because it suggests that complex behavior and structure can emerge spontaneously from the interactions between multiple factors, **without the need for a central controller or designer**. This has important implications for understanding the emergence of behavior and structure in a wide range of domains, and for developing interventions or policies that can support self-organizing systems.
