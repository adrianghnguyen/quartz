# Understanding passionate vs erotic love (ask vs sevgi in turkish)

This is one of the disadvantages of English. In Turkish, there are 2 words for love: aşk and sevgi.

## Ask is is romantic and passionate love which may wither

Aşk means romantic and erotic love, the one that is filled with passion and lust for a partner. However aşk is **limited**. The flames of passion die out after a while. According to the [[Common cultural myths about love|cultural myths about love]], it is not everlasting.

## Sevgi is unlimited love which does not die out

Sevgi is the type of love you feel towards a lot of things and not in erotic way. You can have sevgi towards your family, parents, pets, your nation, nature, plants, a toy, and again your romantic partner. However, sevgi is **unlimited**.

***It does not die out unless the image of what you love is shattered in some way.***

You know how elderly couples seem very cute together and love each other? You wouldn't say their love seems erotic and passionate anymore like the love of a younger couple. But even if they are wrinkled and maybe can't walk anymore, those couples love each other beyond what is attractive. In those relationships, the passion of erotic love might have died out but sevgi remains the same. It is unconditional, it is not about looks, and it is beyond physical love or aşk.

## Understanding the difference between ask and sevi

In Turkish, when we first say to someone we like them and date with them, we say "seni seviyorum". It means I love you, but it is said using "sevgi". We also say I love you in form of "sana aşığım" which is said using "aşk" this time.

But the reason we usually use sevgi for first time love declarations, is because we mean "I love you and I am interested in you, not just in your looks and attractiveness, but you. I want to spend a lifetime with you."

We usually say "sana aşığım" using aşk when we specifically mean we desire the person passionately, and this one is only said to [[Love is the pursuit of our emotional home|romantic partners]]. Seni seviyorum can also be said to your very close ones such as immediate family. But, yeah that is the distinction.

## What does love mean?

Based on [Kierkegaard, on love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oIDVxTHsUA)

"It is true love when we can look at someone who appears misguided, lazy, entitled, angry or proud and instead of labelling them as despicable, we can perceive the lost, [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerable]], or hurt or child that must lie somewhere within the perplexing or dispiriting adult"

It means that when we say we love someone, we see them with all their troubles and difficulties as a whole.

Learn to love on the [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|basis of shared humanity]].  Am I [[Be less critical of others by taking a pause to reflect|too picky]] in what I love?
