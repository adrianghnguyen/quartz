# Evergreen note titles are like apis

#status/done

When [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) are factored and titled well, those titles become an abstraction for the note itself. The entire note’s ideas can then be referenced using that handle (see [Concept handles, after Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5vA4vw86DKNq22xt6pRWhumeRmSzwV6hxRHE)). In fact, this property itself functions as a kind of litmus: as you develops ideas in notes over time and improve the “APIs,” you’ll be able to write individual notes which abstract over increasingly large subtrees (e.g. [Enacted experiences have incredible potential as a mass medium](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6oXuXLZ7Wq1eBqskyfph2wz9gjohQUKSBFzx), [Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be)).

Some effective note “API design” techniques: separation of concerns ([Evergreen notes should be atomic](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1)), sharp titles ([Prefer note titles with complete phrases to sharpen claims](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KmNj3oKKSTJfqdfSEBzTQiCVGoC4GfK3rYW)), and positive framings ([Prefer positive note titles to promote systematic theory](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8T6sLNco2benUMgcXUXeJh35eW2obP48DoPp)).
