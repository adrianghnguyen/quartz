## Difference between information and knowledge

> [!quote] On the difference between information and knowledge
> "Knowledge is the knowing of something, and information is what you can (or can't) know."^[https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eb/qa/Knowledge-and-Information#:~:text=Knowledge%20is%20awareness%2C%20understanding%2C%20or,or%20can't\)%20know.]

[[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]

Can information be objective ([[The impossibility of conveying objective truth]])? It's impossible to *know (ie. knowledge)* all information so we must use heuristics ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]]) to simplify information in a way that is digestible and makes sense ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]). However, one must design the system in a way that one isn't providing an excess of inputs beyond our processing capacity ([[Information overconsumption]]) as it will reduce our ability to make decisions ([[Brains are biased by nature]])

Information bottlenecks are related to [[Deep Learning]]. Although I don't understand this at the moment.

> [!NOTE] Difference between information and knowledge
> The points given below are important, so far as the difference between information and knowledge is concerned:
>
> 1. Information denotes the organised data about someone or something obtained from various sources such as newspaper, internet, television, discussions, etc. Knowledge refers to the awareness or understanding on the subject acquired from education or experience of a person.
> 2. Information is nothing but the refined form of data, which is helpful to understand the meaning. On the other hand, knowledge is the relevant and objective information that helps in drawing conclusions.
> 3. Data compiled in the meaningful context provides information. Conversely, when information is combined with experience and intuition, it results in knowledge.
> 4. Processing improves the representation, thus ensures easy interpretation of the information. As against this, processing results in increased consciousness, thus enhances subject knowledge.
> 5. Information brings on comprehension of the facts and figures. Unlike, knowledge which leads to the understanding of the subject.
> 6. The transfer of information is easy through different means, i.e. verbal or non-verbal signals. Conversely, the transfer of knowledge is a bit difficult, because it requires learning on the part of the receiver.
> 7. Information can be reproduced in low cost. However, exactly similar reproduction of knowledge is not possible because it is based on experiential or individual values, perceptions, etc.
> 8. Information alone is not sufficient to make generalisation or predictions about someone or something. On the contrary, knowledge has the ability to predict or make inferences.
> 9. Every information is not necessarily a knowledge, but all knowledge is an information.
