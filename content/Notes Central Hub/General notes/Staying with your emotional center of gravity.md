This is a technique shared in [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]. It's essentially feeling your feels without rejection of being emotional - emotions are a normal and healthy reaction coming from our [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one Emotional Ring]].

It means the following and is further elaborated in Emily Nagoski's other book *Scientific guide to successful relationships:*
1. [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|owning your feelings]]
2. [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|listening]] to them
3. being responsive to your [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|feelings]]

## Creating space for our emotions

It means creating space for emotions and honoring them. It's one of the primary ways of developing positive [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|meta emotions]].

The opposite of this would be running away from our emotions, an [[Stress response system lifecycle|incomplete stress response]] or trying to shift your emotional center of gravity onto your romantic partner. Instead, [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|Do what is uncomfortable]] and engage in a [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|new habits]] to improve yourself and your relationships.

### Identify the emotion you are feeling

[[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|Identify what you are feeling]].

"Right now I feel jealous/angry/hurt/etc." It is normal to have multiple feelings at the same time and they can even be conflicting at times.

### Welcome the Feeling

Don't run away from the feeling, and don't judge, shame, or get angry at it. Sit still with it, treating it like a welcome guest.

Perhaps it's worth considering if I wish to [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditate]] with the thought. Practice [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|non-judgment]].

### Take Responsibility for the Feeling

- If you feel fear or anger, consider how the [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|perceived threat]] can be managed.
- If you feel sadness, hurt, or grief, think about how you can heal the loss.

As you take responsibility for your feelings, ask yourself what will help. 

Sometimes there won't be anything you can actively do, except [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|allowing the feeling to discharge and complete its cycle]]. Sometimes, we simply need to ride it out and [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|let the thoughts go by]].

### Communicate the Feeling and the Need

[[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|Express your feelings in a non-violent manner]] by saying, "I feel x, and I think what would help is y."

For example, you could say, "I feel threatened by the time you spend with your coworker, and I could use some kind of plan that will give me reassurance." Or, "I still have this hurt about that time you did x, and what I need is some time to go through that emotional tunnel so I can get to the light at the end."
