## Attention and optimal performance within flow state

> Another connection between attention and optimal functioning is suggested by the work of Holcomb (1977)^[Holcomb, J. H. (1977). Attention and intrinsic rewards in the control of psychophysiologic states.
> Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, 27, 54–61]. He has found that people who tend to be motivated by intrinsic rewards need fewer papillary fixation points to reverse an ambiguous  visual image. It seems that the ability to find enjoyment in any situation is correlated with the ability to manipulate information internally, with less reliance on external cues.^[p. 10 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15]

Those who have high [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] may be able to manipulate information, form new ideas and connections more easily? That's the correlation? Without need for external stimuli?

Those who are able to find [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|internal motivators]], such as biofeedback signals may receive intrinsic rewards for their effort, which leads to development of more flow…in a [[feedback loop]]? Essentially, they can find internal motivators.

### Explaining the relationship to flow state between attention and intrinsic motivation in details by ChatGPT

> The study "Attention and intrinsic rewards in the control of psychophysiological states" has implications for the concepts of flow and attention.
>
> Flow is a state of optimal experience where an individual is fully immersed in a task, feeling focused and energized, and losing track of time. Attention plays a crucial role in achieving flow, as it allows individuals to focus their energy and effort on the task at hand, while ignoring distractions.
>
> The study suggests that attentional focusing and intrinsic rewards can enhance the regulation of psychophysiological states, which can lead to improved overall well-being. In other words, individuals who are able to focus their attention on the physiological signals that are relevant to achieving flow and receive intrinsic rewards for their efforts may be better able to achieve a state of flow.
>
> **For example, if an individual is trying to achieve flow while engaging in a physical activity like running, they may benefit from focusing their attention on their breathing, heart rate, or other physiological signals that are relevant to their performance**. By using biofeedback training to monitor and regulate these signals, and by receiving intrinsic rewards like positive feedback and encouragement for their efforts, the individual may be more likely to achieve flow and experience greater satisfaction and enjoyment from the activity.
>
> Overall, the study suggests that attentional focusing and intrinsic rewards can play an important role in achieving optimal experience and overall well-being, including the state of flow.^[ChatGPT]
