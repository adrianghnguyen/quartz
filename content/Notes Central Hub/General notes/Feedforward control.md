## Definition of feedforward control

> [!tip] Nuance between feedback and feedforward
> Holy shit, I just realized that it's feedBACK and feedFORWARD. That makes it a lot more simple to understand.

- Feedback control is based on examining the gap between planned outputs and actual outputs **retroactively** (ex-post facto).
- Feedforward is focused on minimizing the difference between planned outputs and actual outputs ahead of the moment of incident **proactively** (ex-ante)

Feedback control | Feedforward control
---| ---
Focuses on the end **result** fixing the system equilibrium | Provides guidance to the system **before** it encounters the disturbance

Another way of putting it: While feedback focuses on the end result fixing the system equilibrium, feedforward provides guidance to the system before it encounters the disturbance - trying to avoid it by pre-emptively giving 'advice' or feedback. If it makes a bad prediction, similar to the hunting methods of dragonflies ([[Learning from dragonflies]]), **control action is taken well before the actual result.**

### Formal definition of feedforward control

> The basic concept of feedforward control isÂ **to measure important disturbance variables and take corrective action before they upset the process**. It takes proactive control actions and can provide better control.^[https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/feedforward-control#:~:text=The%20basic%20concept%20of%20feedforward,and%20can%20provide%20better%20control.]

## Relationship to positive and negative feedback

Control theory is centered around those two arms of mechanisms to adjust a system. Feedback ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]) is one of its key mechanisms while feedforward is the other.

It's interesting because positive and negative feedback are ways by which we learned that behaviors can be altered within psychology. Maybe that's why it's so important to be well-versed in multiple domains, a polymath.

Great artists steal. I made that quote by the way.

### Positive feedback

Positive feedback means that the output has achieved or even *exceeded the plan*.

### Negative feedback

The output was below the plan or *below expectations*

Is there a relationship to [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] ([[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones]])? If you are a perfectionist, because humans are driven to always become better ([[Humans are motivated to grow]]), then your expectations would always be set high. As a result, you will often be more disappointed than happy. Perhaps practicing gratitude ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]] ) allows us to re-adjust set expectations.

## Feedforward control relationship to alternative domains

Based on a quick google search it seems like it's related to neural networks ([[Neural Network]]) as there was a mention in one of the search hits. It's related to feedback and is its inverse ([[Inversion as a mental model]]).

First learned about this within [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]]. It's a part of [[Control Systems Theory|Control Theory]].

## Personal implications of feedforward control in my daily life

I often write notes reflecting what I think I'll think about. This is pattern prediction and is an attempt to alleviate future [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information]] ([[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information]]) through avoiding recall. We have limited active memory ([[Working memory is limited]]) so we should take positive actions towards the future while it remains salient. This is like timing pushes in StarCraft?

Making a checklist and adjusting the checklist ahead of time would also be an example of feedforward control I think.

### Leaving breadcrumbs is feedforward control

I often write notes reflecting what I think I'll think about, as part of the getting things done process ([[Getting Things Done by David Allen]]. This is pattern prediction and is an attempt to alleviate future [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information]] through avoiding recall. We have limited active memory so we should take positive actions towards the future while it remains salient. This is like timing pushes in StarCraft?
