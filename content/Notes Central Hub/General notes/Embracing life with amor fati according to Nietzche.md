# Embracing life in its entirety with amor fati according to Nietzche

#status/done

It's embracing [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|stoicism]] in regard to one's fate. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life can be complicated after all]] where we'll face many [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transitions]]. We'll also get [[Many lifetimes to live|many opportunities through our many lifetimes]] so [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure should not hold us back from trying]].

We'll meet many wonderful people along the way, and some of those will bloom into [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|real friendships]] which will create beautiful memories for which we can reminisce. To be happy, we must also [[Happiness is born hand in hand misery|embrace misery]] to live a wholehearted life [[Love is the pursuit of our emotional home|filled with love]].

It's also about avoiding grass is greener thinking.

1. Nietzsche's concept of amor fati, or love of one's fate, encourages embracing and adoring every aspect of life.
2. It entails accepting and loving one's past, present, and future without regret or resistance.
3. Nietzsche's philosophy suggests that every decision made and every condition of [[Understanding the complexity of life|life is inevitable]] and the best possible outcome.
4. Resenting or fighting against the past or present only intensifies [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|suffering]] and adds to the misery.
5. Amor fati is a challenging ideal to strive towards, but it offers the opportunity to find beauty and affirmation in all aspects of existence.

At times, life may not seem so good but *perhaps the journey was worth having after all*.
