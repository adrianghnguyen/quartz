> **Could you give us a sense of what your** [**longer-term career paths**](https://80000hours.org/career-planning/process/longer-term-paths/#what-should-a-longer-term-plan-look-like) **might be****? ***


Despite having selected multiple causes, I know that deep down, mental health is the problem for which I want to create social impact with my career. With the ballooning mental health epidemic, and a shortage of mental health resources, I believe that there is a role where I could bring my unique skillsets to deliver something good for the world - especially since my undergraduate background is in psychology.

I've completed the 80 000 hours career planning template and have reviewed some career paths which may be a good fit for me, under the theme of mental health. Here are two from my document. I'm reaching out to 80 000 hours since I think that I could use some help on how experts on career knowledge may have a better take.

 1. Develop impactful technologies for democratizing mental health through either data analytics, programming or product management
	- Pros: Prior experience working in tech sector, flexible opportunities depending on how I wish to grow my skillset
	- Cons: Growing industry which is still not mature in its ability to provide impact - many companies are developing apps for examples but I feel like our understanding of how much it helps people is still limited.
2. Research mental health and cognitive sciences (and envision potential technology applications - such as AI?)
	- Pros: Ability to drive the theoretical work which impacts downstream applications, may be a good career fit in terms of interesting in research  
	- Cons: Requires advanced studies, disconnection from applied work/impact, limited personal experience in this area
3. Organizational policy/building in mental health - something I haven't researched as much
	- Pros: Ability to directly influence institutional resources and actions, helping organizations become more effective/optimize processes (something I enjoy and interests me)
	- Cons: Possible distance to 'action', lack of starting career capital

> Tell us about any interest or involvement you’ve had in effective altruism.

I've stumbled across forum posts here and there but did not know that there was an actual movement focused on maximizing our social impact for the good not only of humanity but general well-being. I'm happy to have been recommended this organization as it helps formalize a lot of what I have been researching in terms of my career next steps.


## How I found out about this organization

I was recently chatting with my friend %% [[Davis Ly Ngo]]%% and he recommended that I check out 80 000 hours, an organization focused on helping people develop their careers for those who care about social impact.

From my quick cursory reading, the service is free and it helps kickstart the careers of those looking to re-orient themselves by connecting them with mentors or organizations within job boards.

Maybe looking through it will affect [[My career mission|my career mission]]. As part of the [[Traits defining great work|traits of great work]], I wish to have a personal impact and drive worthwhile outcomes. I think [[Effective altruism is a philosophy of maximizing personal impact for the well-being of others|effective altruism]] is important for [[My career reflections and planning|my career]].
