# Types of cycling facilities in rapid implementation projects

#status/done

Related to [[REF Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver]]

There are two primary types of which are applicable for these kind of projects:
1. Protected bicycle lanes
2. Neighbourhood bikeways

They can be built in a range of materials with different benefit/cost ratios.  As we can see in the chart below, they are approximately ranked in terms of safety and cost, with higher levels of protection being more expensive.

Some options includes:
-   Painted buffers
-   Flexible delineator posts
-   Modular plastic curbs
-   Planter boxes
-   Pre-cast concrete curbs
-   Extruded curbs
-   Concrete barriers

## Protected bicycle lanes

They're bicycles with physical protection. People say, like providing horizontal and often vertical separation from motor vehicles using a variety of treatments and materials. Different [[Detailed summary of bicycle path treatments|bicycle path treatments]] will offer different types of protection.

## Neighborhood bikeways

> Neighbourhood bikeways are streets with *low traffic volumes and speeds* that are [[Levels of traffic stress for cyclists|comfortable for people cycling]] to share the road with motor vehicles. Signage, pavement markings, and intersection treatments are used to enhance these facilities and provide wayfinding.

These are very common in Montreal. Neighborhood bikeways provide a combination of traffic diversion (volume reduction), as well as traffic calming (speed reduction) features.

### Examples of traffic diversion features which focus on reducing the volume of cars

- Full road closures
- Conversion to one-way
- Diagonal diverters
- Median islands

These are examples of modal filtering by using obstacles to help redirect or prevent cars from entering certain areas. It's to help ensure that traffic stays at the neighborhood level - preventing pass-through traffic.

### Traffic calming aims to reduce car speeds
