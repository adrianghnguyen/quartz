# Creating long term happiness requires key habits

Related to [[Happiness is the result of love]]

In the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|Harvard course on happiness]],  one of the key objectives is to learn the best practices of people are well and healthy and what we *can control* within our lives to increase our capacity for happiness.

A lot of it can be attributed to luck or just things that are outside of our control, as outlined in the [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|happiness portfolio]]. We can't control what parents, or our biological health, etc. Here, we are focused on things which are [[Make the future you want with personal agency|within our control]] such as habits and behaviour. [[Happiness requires action|Happiness requires intention.]]

## Take care of your body

This is somewhat common sense, but it's still important to highlight - think of the [[Mind-body connection|mind-body connection]]. It's crucial to take care of our personal health.

- Eat well
- Don't abuse drugs and avoid tobacco
- Exercise regularly - it helps reduce stress by [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|completing the stress response cycle]] which was confirmed by this [[REF Unifying Theory of Effects of physical exercise on anxiety, depression, and sensitivity to stress|Study on the Effects of Physical Exercise on Anxiety]]
- Try and get a decent amount of [[Sleep is important|sleep]] and [[Maintain sleep hygiene|make it regular]]

These are all bedrocks for better physical well being, which predicts healthier aging and a longer life.

## Build strong long-lasting relationship and be connected to others

According to Robert Waldinger, this was a more surprising finding of the [[Harvard and Boston longitudinal studies on adult life development|longitudinal studies on adult life]]. People who are better connected to other people would stay healthy longer and be happier. Apparently many people pay lip service today idea that the [[Mind-body connection|mind and body are connected]].

According to the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|Harvard course on happiness]], we should have a close council of five people such as [[Traits and qualities of strong relationships|close friendships]] who we wish to nurture our happiness and [[Choose social circles wisely|invest in them]] since [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|personal energy is limited]].

## 7 Habits for happiness

Here are seven key habits which is measured within the [[Seven habits scale to evaluate well-being|Seven Habits Scale (SHS)]] we should maintain to be happy and well, according to Dr. George Vaillant. Maybe it's important to integrate it into my [[My personal principles|my personal principles]].

> 1. Do not smoke.
> 2. Do not abuse alcohol.
> 3. Maintain a healthy body weight.
> 4. Maintain daily exercise.
> 5. Develop an [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive coping style]] (this means that you have good conflict-resolution practices).
> 6. Foster a [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]] (invest in education or the practices of lifelong learning).
> 7. Maintain stable, long-term friendships and loving relationships.

## Reversing the habits which tend to make us unhappy

When times feel difficult and I want to go back to my [[Change your default behaviours|default behaviour]], I can learn to practice the [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|opposite signal strategy]] to overcome non-beneficial behaviours and encourage [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplasticity]]. Another way of trimming things which don't add to my life is to use the [[Use the reverse bucket list strategy to create sustainable joy|reverse bucket list strategy]] to create sustainable joy.

There are a couple of key habits to avoid if we wish to avoid [[Minimize sources of unhappiness|unhappiness]], as presented in [[REF 7 Ways to Maximize Misery ðŸ˜ž|REF 7 Ways to Maximize Misery ðŸ˜ž]]. I've adapted it to be things I would like to do if I wish to [[Self-Determination Theory seeks to understand how we make motivations related to behaviour and personality|take control]] of my personal happiness:

1. Engage in exercise which can help us release [[Endorphins enhance mood and act as painkillers|endorphins]] - it has [[Benefits of exercise|many benefits]]
2. Expand my physical and psychological space by visiting rather than only staying in my bedroom
3. Create a [[Maintain sleep hygiene|regular sleep schedule]] otherwise it becomes a vicious cycle of insomnia and increases susceptibility of disrupted mental health
4. Minimize the time I spend on digital devices by practicing [[Digital Minimalism|digital minimalism]] and only using them when they are beneficial/necessary. It's easy to succumb to [[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism|superficial boredom]].
5. Stay away from sources of negative emotions - such as rage-bait content, doomer headlines, etc.
6. Make [[Create effective goals|effective goals]] which concretize objectives and move us closer to our [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|ideal life]]
7. Follow habits which will increase the [[The Happiness Equation|likehood of happiness]] rather than chasing it directly using techniques such as a [[Happiness checklist to keep what is good and remove the bad|happiness checklist]]
