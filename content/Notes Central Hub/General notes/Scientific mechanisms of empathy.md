## The role of oxytocin within empathy

[[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|Oxytocin—the hormone in the brain that is involved in human trust]] also plays a big role. The ability to a higher sense of empathy would seem to be linked to the ease/size of the activation effect of oxytocin networks.

Is that perhaps an explanation as to why [[High intellectual potential overview|gifted children]] may possess a higher sense of empathy - more neuronal connection related to their [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitivity]]?

## How empathy occurs neurobiologically

Mirror neurons means we are recreating the [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|feelings]] of the other through mirroring their body language and their state of mind. Studies have shown that when another person is being inflicted [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|pain]], the subject also has brain activity in the same sector via the mirrored neurons.

When you [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|practice gratefulness]], you allow yourself to reconstruct happy [[Memory is processed information|memories]] such as [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|happiness nuggets]] which is like re-experiencing the [[Neurochemistry of love|pleasure and associated happiness]] at the time.

## Sociology of empathy

### Socio-demographic factors impacting empathy

> Socio-demographic and academic factors including gender ([Toussaint and Webb, 2005](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B66); [Schulte-Ruther et al., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B60)), year in school ([Coulehan and Williams, 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B13)), and future career preference ([Li et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B43)) affect medical student empathy. Psychological factors such as personality traits ([Song and Shi, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B62); [Abe et al., 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B1)), sense of power ([Garden, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B20); [Toto et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B65)), stress, and burnout ([Rosen et al., 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B58); [Gleichgerrcht and Decety, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B21); [Yuguero Torres et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/#B75)) are also influential factors. Several studies worldwide have also shown that women have higher empathy levels than men.

### Empathy allows humans to be more effective social animals

- [[Evolutionary Moral Psychology Theory|moral cooperation theory]]
- [[Human cooperation theory|human cooperation theory]]
- The ability to have higher empathy would promote cooperation and trust in humans who are social creatures. As a result, impeded oxytocin release - one of the neurotransmitters within this process - would reduce the sense of cooperation that perhaps. I wonder if that's explained in the neuroscience of psychopaths.
