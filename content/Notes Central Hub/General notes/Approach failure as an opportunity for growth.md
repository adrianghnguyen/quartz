It brings out harrowing thoughts of [[Self-confidence|self-doubt]], [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] and invokes [[Dealing with our inner critic|the wrath of the mind's accuser]].

We tend to set [[Perfectionism|set unreasonable standards]] or forget to [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|celebrate small victories]] by immediately replacing the afterglow with bigger ones.
