## The selfish nature of attachment

*Attachment is selfish* in its concept because assumes ownership of the other's nature. The other in turn is now responsible for you. Thinking about the golden rule, we hold no responsibility for the other and so in turn should expect nothing less. *Expectations are but a form of attachment*.

When we are grateful, we *choose to [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|honour the bond]]* between us and the other such as an experience, object, person or the metaphysical. We choose to *see it as distinct to ourselves*, yet we get the privilege of sharing a moment in time with the other in this universe. We recognize the *nonlinearity of the concept of time and space* and see the past, the present and the future of the experience with it leaving its mark one way or another.

By [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being grateful]], we are [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|empathetic]]. We recognize that just as we have been touched by the lineage of the beginning of time until this present moment, so has everything led up to the other. Just as we may have scars and [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|happy moments from the past]], so will have they.

With grace, we [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|practice mindfulness]] to enjoy the full [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|gift of the moment]] and choose to let it go back to its natural resting state, in whatever way it will become intertwined in our lives or lead it along a separate path.

## Buddha taught us that enlightenment is learning to let go of attachments

The reasons why attachment can be harmful to ourselves and create [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|human suffering]] is better explained i[[Human suffering stems from personal attachment]]original sayings of the Buddha]]. We should learn to let go. To be attached is to suffer, because we cannot control things.

## Letting go of attachment and expectations

Being attached to specific outcomes can be quite difficult at times and may lead us to be needlessly disappointed. We often have own our preconceived notions about the world, and expecting it to conform may not be a [[unrealistic expectations|realistic expectation]]. Perhaps we think we deserve a particular status, or form of [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|external recognition]].

I think finding inner peace through [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|acceptance that we can only control our own reaction]] is a better way of approaching life. For what we cannot control, we can let it go by without [[Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happen|forcing an outcome]]. That would apply to personal relationships, [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|career journey]] and expectations of the self such as [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]].

It's a topic thoroughly explored within [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula|Buddhism]] where the root of human suffering stems from a philosophical sense of attachment. I've tried to explore this though by exploring the [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|concept of interconnection and empathy]] by seeing a part of ourselves as a whole but distinct. The [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|root of human suffering]] comes from the attachment of human desires.

> Attachment and connection are two distinct concepts that play a significant role in our relationships and overall well-being. While they may seem similar, there are key differences between the two.
> Attachment refers to the emotional bond or dependence we develop towards someone or something. It often arises from a sense of need or insecurity, where we believe that our happiness or sense of self-worth is dependent on the presence or actions of another person or thing. Attachment can manifest in various ways, such as clinging to a particular outcome, possessiveness, or [[fear of abandonment]].
> 
> On the other hand, connection refers to a deep and genuine bond that we develop with others based on mutual understanding, trust, and shared values. Unlike attachment, connection is not driven by neediness or fear but by a desire for companionship and genuine intimacy. Connection allows for individual growth, respect of boundaries, and the ability to maintain healthy relationships.
> 
> Letting go of attachment is an essential step towards cultivating healthy connections. By releasing our attachment to specific outcomes or expectations in relationships, we open ourselves up to more authentic connections built on trust and mutual respect. Letting go of attachment does not mean abandoning relationships or becoming indifferent; instead, it involves accepting that we cannot control others' actions or emotions and focusing on nurturing genuine connections based on love, understanding, and support.
> 
> When we let go of attachment, we free ourselves from unnecessary suffering and allow space for personal growth and the growth of our relationships. It allows us to be present in the moment rather than constantly seeking validation or security from external sources. By cultivating connection instead of attachment, we can experience deeper levels of joy, fulfillment, and emotional well-being.
> In conclusion, attachment and connection are distinct concepts that have a significant impact on our relationships. Letting go of attachment is crucial for developing healthy connections built on authenticity and mutual respect. By embracing connection over attachment, we can experience more profound levels of happiness and enhance our overall well-being.
