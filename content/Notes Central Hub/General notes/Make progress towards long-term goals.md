### Key reflections for the exercise

> - Looking at your grid, are you leaving the things you care about to chance or are you actively pursuing them? Are the goals you have identified things you truly want to achieve?
> - Are you allowing certain things to dominate your time and attention that work against your goals?
> - How do you think you should manage your time and attention so you are actively working towards your goals?
