The ads on YouTube mobile are quite invasive. Someone made a forked version of YouTube called ReVanced which has its own mini updater and can block ads.

- Download compiled YouTube APK (YouTube-revnanced) for Android which can be found here: [Releases · j-hc/revanced-magisk-module](https://github.com/j-hc/revanced-magisk-module/releases)

- Also need to install MicroG service if not already installed to provide updates/Google account sign in bypass
