## Backward hypothesis

To determine cause and effect of things, we work from the effect, backwards until we understand the chain of events which caused the original inciting incident.

> The backward hypothesis, also known as the backwards hypothesis or the inverse hypothesis, is a theoretical approach in [[Cognitive Psychology|cognitive psychology]] that suggests that our understanding of cause and effect relationships is based on our ability to mentally reverse the direction of events.
>
> According to the backward hypothesis, we develop a sense of causality by mentally reversing the sequence of events in our minds. For example, if we observe a ball hitting a window and causing it to break, we mentally reverse the sequence of events and imagine the window breaking first, followed by the ball hitting it. By mentally reversing the sequence of events, we are able to understand that the broken window was caused by the impact of the ball.

> The backward hypothesis has been used to explain a wide range of cognitive phenomena, including our ability to make inferences about causal relationships, our ability to reason about hypothetical scenarios, and our ability to learn from experience. It suggests that our understanding of causality is not just based on direct observation, but also on our ability to mentally manipulate and reverse the sequence of events in our minds.

## Backward chaining

> Backward chaining (or backward reasoning) is an inference method described colloquially as working backward from the goal. It is used in automated theorem provers, inference engines, proof assistants, and other [[Artificial intelligence]] applications.
>
> In game theory, researchers apply it to (simpler) subgames to find a solution to the game, in a process called backward induction. In chess, it is called retrograde analysis, and it is used to generate table bases for chess endgames for computer chess.
>
> Backward chaining is implemented in logic programming by SLD resolution. Both rules are based on the modus ponens inference rule. It is one of the two most commonly used methods of reasoning with inference rules and logical implications â€“ the other is forward chaining. Backward chaining systems usually employ a depth-first search strategy, e.g. Prolog.
>
> Backward chaining starts with a list of goals (or a hypothesis) and works backwards from the consequent to the antecedent to see if any data supports any of these consequents.^[Wikipedia

## Working backwards from goals

Backward chaining is a problem-solving technique where you start from the desired goal and work backwards which can be applied to personal goals.

### Steps to use backward chaining for personal goals

  1. Define your goal
  2. Identify the final step
  3. Determine the preceding step
  4. Continue backward
  5. Prioritize and plan
  6. Take action
  7. Monitor progress and adjust if needed

By using backward chaining, you can break down complex objectives into manageable tasks and create a clear [[Purpose in life|roadmap towards success]].
