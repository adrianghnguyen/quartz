Most of our initial thoughts are suggestions probably a result of [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|heuristic thinking]]. In Buddhist philosophy, it is called the Monkey Mind.  Some thoughts are stupid and should just be disregarded - especially when stem from [[Dealing with our inner critic|voice of the accuser]], being overly harsh and critical.

[[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|Meditation]] can serve as a powerful tool to allow us to regain [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|explicit reasoning (higher level thinking)]] and train our brains to disregard the ones which are not useful. [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|Negative feelings]] have their time and place - but [[Dealing with our inner critic|excessive self-criticism]] is unnecessary.

This is in part due to [[Attentional bias|attentional bias which is influenced by environmental distractions]] - inciting [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|prompts of our minds]] as it seeks to recognize patterns and organize information within our existing [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]]. This would be an example of [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking]].

However, this can be disruptive if we need to focus deeply on something as there is a [[Mental cost of context switching|mental cost to context switching]]. As a result, it may be worthwhile to take the time to create [[Create a distraction-free environment|distraction-free environments]].
