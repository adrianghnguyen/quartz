# Observe-orient-decide-act (OODA)

You should always be scouting before making decisions by gathering information. [[My love letter to Starcraft|That's what FlaSh would do.]]

Short for the cycling process of **observe–orient–decide–act** (OODA) is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] developed by military strategists to explain how combat operation decisions should be conducted during military campaigns. However this decision-making model can be applied to a variety of contexts such as how we learn or dealing with unfamiliar scenarios

It explains how an entity(individual/organization), who can process this cycle making decisions faster than their opponent, can disrupt the opponent's decision cycle and gain the advantage with superior response time.

As for myself, I feel like it's a good [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|heuristic]] when I feel like [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|I am lost]].

## OODA loop explained in steps

- **Observe** - Identifying the problem and [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|situational awareness]]
- **Orient** - Taking the time to reflect on observations from prior step and understanding *before* making a decision.
	- It's also crucial to understand what biases you may be applying to take an objective course of action.
- **Decide** - Develop an action plan
- **Act** - Carry out the decision

## Factors complicating ability to process the loop

- The number of potential scenarios that can be pursued.
- Denial that a specific event has occurred, and refusing to acknowledge it right away.
- The complexity of the stimulus.
- The [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|emotional stress]] of the team or environment at the onset of the stimulus.
- The level of trust that exists within a team to rely on each other’s decisions.
- The amount of intuitive skill that is possessed relating to the stimulus.
	- [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]] can be one way of increasing our competency
- Clearly, or unclearly, defined business goals.
- Stimuli that is constantly evolving or changing.
- The need for approval prior to carrying out a response.
