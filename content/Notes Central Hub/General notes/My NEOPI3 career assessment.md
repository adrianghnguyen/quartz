# My neopi3 career assessment

## Big 5 ocean

- Focuses on Big 5 (OCEAN) and their individual facets
- This assessment was done with [[Mathieu Guenette]]

[[2022 - NEOPI3 -  Adrian_Nguyen.pdf|NEOPI3 - Personality Inventory Big 5 OCEAN]]

Here are my results for [[My MBTI|my personality]] survey result. Do note that the DSM does not recognize this as an official diagnostic assessment.

- See also [[Neuroticism]] which should not be confused with neurosis
- A lot of this seems to check out with my [[Neuroticism|personality]] yeah. Nothing much to say for the ones who know me. I think I'm kinda special in my own way but then again - who isn't?

## Personal reflections as of [[2023-07-12]]

It's interesting to go through these results today, a lot of the scores are very high in percentiles. And where we see that there's a bit of a [[Dealing with weakness|weakness]] is within N4, which is conscience of the self. Since I last met [[Mathieu Guenette|Mathieu Guenette]], I think that's been a big point of focus in terms of learning [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|confidence]] and knowing myself. I think this is something I achieved by facing my [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] and learning more about what [[My core values define what matters|my core values]] are. I would also like to think that I have built a bit more resilience towards neurosis, and that's by understanding myself a bit better.

We also see that within the conscience and self-reflection, I have C6, a reflection score of 14 with a percentile of 6. I would need to check what that means exactly. C6 is defined as reflection, which is the tendency to think before acting. That means I often act as someone who's spontaneous and capable of making decisions when it is necessary, but it can also mean that I don't really think before engaging in consequences. That's something I'll need to think about.
