# Defi métropolitain

It's an event that participated on [[2023-05-28]] and ended up meeting my friend %%[[Suyuchen Wang|WongSoo]]%%. It was an event consisting of 150 kilometers going across the Saint-Bruno and Saint Hyacinthe region. It was the first time pushing myself to go that far. I had only previously done 100 km at that point, something which I tested out only a few days earlier.

On the day of the event, I took the shuttle near the arena and I ended up making my new friend %%[[Suyuchen Wang]]%%. Turns out that most people who like bikes really, really, really like bikes. We were talking about gear, how we got into it and how his friends also got into cycling recently. We ended up chatting a bit, then resting in the shuttle. That morning I had drank way too much water, so I had to ask him to let me out.

After asking their driver, he told me that there was approximately 3000 participants in the event. There were multiple distances in the event, ranging from 40 kilometers all the way to 150. To challenge myself, I decided to do the full distance. I rode part of the way with my friend pulling him. And it was interesting to see how much stronger I have become. He was barely able to keep up with me, despite him all so having started a year back. I do benefit from the luxury of time, though, and to just ride a lot.

Around the mountain, we branched off because he decided to do the shorter distances of 100 kilometers. From there, it was solo riding. Everything was going well, but it was insane to see some of those people who are really competitive go so much faster. I could also see the advantage of being in a peloton group, even having two to three riders makes a huge difference.

The biggest challenge came to be when we entered empty fields. There was a strong 30 kilometers an hour headwind at that point. It was horrible, but I was very lucky to draft off of other people. Our speed crawled down to completely 20KILOMETERS an hour as a peloton group. There were a couple points where my knees were hurting, and I was contemplating giving up. You can see on the map where it is in blue, where we were hit by the headwind, the strongest.

I had actually consumed all the sugar had brought with me, and I was close to [[Endurance fuelling requires energy consumption|bonking]] at some points, I believe. At that point I simply smashed in all the sugar I had left. I noticed myself drifting off the road and barely able to keep a straight line. after we passed the hardest sections, I feel like I got a second wind though. I could see a lot of people struggling to finish towards the end, but that's when I started getting my energy back.

It turns out that I have a [[fast and slow twitch muscles|pretty decent sprint]]. I hit a peak speed of 58 km/h. Even on descents, actually felt pretty safe, as long as there were no cars and I could tell where the road was going.

It was a very fun [[Cycling events and destinations|cycling event]] and I'm looking forward to the other ones such as the [[Tour la Nuit|Tour la Nuit]].
