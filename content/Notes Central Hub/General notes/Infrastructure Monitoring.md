Infrastructure monitoring software tools capture [log files](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/log-file/) from throughout the network and aggregate them into a single database where they can be sorted, queried and analyzed by either humans or machine algorithms.^[https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/infrastructure-monitoring/] One approach is to use [[infrastructure as code]] to ease the deployment of such systems and ensure it can be consistent and repeatable. It's very similar to [[Monitoring as code|monitoring as code]] with a tool like.

## Key takeaways

-   Infrastructure monitoring software tools capture log files from throughout a network and aggregate them into a single database where they can be sorted, queried, and analyzed manually or by machine algorithms.
-   There are three forms of infrastructure monitoring: hardware, network, and application monitoring.
-   Infrastructure monitoring creates opportunities to proactively identify security risks and mitigate operational issues before they negatively impact customers.
