Attachment styles refer to specific patterns of behavior in and around relationships. See [[We love through attachment behaviors|how these attachment behaviours affect us when we are in love]].

There are four adult [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment styles]]:
- secure
- anxious (also referred to as preoccupied)
- avoidant (also referred to as dismissive)
- disorganized

These styles can impact how individuals interact with others in romantic relationships, friendships, and other social situations.

About half the people in the United States developed [[Secure attachment style have a foundation of positive beliefs in relationships|secure attachment]] styles, while half will develop insecure attachment styles.^[Feeney and Noller, “Attachment Style”; Bifulco et al., “Adult Attachment Style.”] There is no particular relationship to gender on this factor either^[Warber and Emmers-Sommer, “Relationships among Sex, Gender and Attachment.”]

## Attachment styles stem from early patterns of interactions with attachment figures

> When you get close to someone, it can bring to the surface unresolved issues from the past. In Deborah’s case, she wasn’t aware of her [[fear of abandonment]] until after she married to Scott. Due to the inconsistency in her caregivers, she developed an [anxious attachment](https://movingpastdivorce.com/2021/09/how-attachment-style-determines-your-choices-in-a-partner/) style. It’s difficult to separate from Scott and see him as a person with good qualities and flaws.
>
> Likewise, Scott’s [avoidant attachment](https://movingpastdivorce.com/2021/09/how-attachment-style-determines-your-choices-in-a-partner/) style developed as a result of having a father who was controlling and insensitive. Scott’s fear of entrapment surfaced after the birth of their son when Deborah started needing more support (she found parenting challenging due to ineffective role models). 
>
> Once Deborah and Scott gained awareness about how the differences in their attachment styles contributed to their [pursuer-distancer dynamic](https://www.gottman.com/blog/the-pursuer-distancer-dynamic/), they could discuss it and felt less triggered. They learned to empathize and be more understanding.

## Attachment style is fluid and variable

Attachment style is linked to [[Sexual response can be changed through attitudes|sexual response]] and relationship satisfaction, and it varies from person to person, but also relationship to relationship (this is called within-person variation).^[La Guardia et al., “Within-Person Variation in Security of Attachment.”] It can also change over time.^[Davila, Burge, and Hammen, “Why Does Attachment Style Change?”]

To improve this,

- Practice [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional intelligence]]
- [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|Accept our feelings and needs as valid]]
- [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity]]

## Types of attachment styles explained

There are multiple types of [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment styles]] which affect our behaviour in relationships, including friendships as well as romantic ones. They can be fluid, complex and can change with time. By [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|taking ownership]] over our [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]], and [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|healing from trauma]], we can change to a [[Insecure attachment styles are rooted in insecurities|an insecure attachment style]] to [[Secure attachment style have a foundation of positive beliefs in relationships|secure base of attachment]].
