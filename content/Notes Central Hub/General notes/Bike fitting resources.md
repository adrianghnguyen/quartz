## Why is a good bike fit important?

A lot of people use many rules of thumbs in order to determine their bike fit.

However, use of heuristics can be useful to get in the right ballpark but in order to avoid long term injury, one should seek a professional bike bit or learn how to self-diagnose posture issues with many caveats.

As a result, I've spent a lot of time in understanding the body's biomechanics and its relevant posture. I'm sure I have lots to still learn but I did my best to engage in [[Reading effectively|syntopical reading]] of untangling the web of mess and poor misinformation line, I feel like I've understood enough general principles.

## Principles for bike fitting

> Comfort + Efficiency = [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|Performance]]
> \-  [Steve Hogg](https://www.stevehoggbikefitting.com/)

### Bodies Compensate for Poor Fit

- Bodies are excellent at compensating for poor fit until they reach the point of failure.

### Consider the Holistic System

- When making bike fitting modifications, it is important to consider the entire holistic system.
- Modifying things such as stem length will affect the center of gravity, so adjustments to seat setback may be necessary.
- Aim to get in the general ballpark and then start tweaking from there.

### Start with Seat Height

- Often, it is best to start with seat height and then make modifications to the rest of the bike fit.
- Assuming your frame is in the appropriate size range, begin with adjusting the seat height.

### Each Body is Unique

- Each body is unique, so it is important not to overly rely on heuristics for fitting, such as knee over spindle or straight leg positioning.

### Seat Height Considerations

- If your seat height is within the appropriate range, it is better to err on the lower side than too high.
- You can check if your hip bones are rocking to determine if the seat height is appropriate.
- As your form gets tired, it is beneficial to have a margin of error, so consider dropping the seat height by 5-10mm once you find the "right" seat height.
- You should be able to complete your pedal stroke without looking like you're trying to tip toe.
- Be careful of your knees caving in or pedaling with a side angle of your foot aka they're slanted.
- Most people have one longer leg than another and when the seat is too high, will begin sacrificing their non-dominant leg leading to pain on the leg which needs to overstretch.
- The goal is to get both sides of the pedal to have good pedal strokes

### Seat Height and Cockpit Adjustments

- Adjust the seat height first and then make adjustments to the cockpit.
- Moving the seat fore/aft in order to compensate for reach is a no-no. The seat fore/aft is about your center of gravity while the reach is about your relative seat distance to the cockpit.

### Actively Listen to Your Body

- Learn to actively listen to your body's cues during biking.
- Biking should not cause pain, even though it is a highly static exercise in terms of posture.
- Balancing aero performance with comfort leads to maximum performance.

### Smooth Pedal Motion

- Pedal motion should be smooth without points of acceleration throughout the pedal stroke.
- Loss of control in the pedal motion can be indicated by a "whip" during the pedal stroke.

### Bike Seat Angle

- Start with a neutral angle for your bike seat and make minor adjustments from there.
- Tilting the seat too far up can cause perineum/soft tissue pressure, while tilting it too far down can cause you to slip forward and place excessive weight on your hands.

### Beware of Misinformation

- Biking, like many other performance-oriented fields, has a lot of misinformation.
- Base your bike fit decisions on scientific-based and [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|deliberate thinking]], rather than following fads.

### Mid-Foot Cycling Position

- Use a mid-foot cycling position to avoid torque overleverage on the toes.
- If your seat is too high, you might end up pedaling with your toes, which can lead to foot pain.

### Professional Athletes and Bike Fit

- Do not rely solely on professional athletes when determining your bike fit.
- Professional athletes often endure aggressive postures for marginal performance gains, and they may have hyper-flexibility that differs from the average person.

### Understand Your Center of Gravity

- Understand your center of gravity when determining your bike fit.
- A general test is the "naruto" run, where you should be able to pedal at 80% FTP while being able to lift your hands up or place them behind you. The pedaling force should be balanced with your seating to minimize weight on your hands.

### Common Points of Modification

- Stem height using spacers can be adjusted.
- Stem length often falls within the fit range of 70mm-120mm and may require experimentation.
- Handlebar width is another point of modification to consider.

### How to set handlebar height

> 1. **Don't obsess over measurements:** Avoid the urge to measure the handlebar drop. Instead, focus on how your body feels while riding.
> 2. **Handlebars too high:** If you feel like you're propping more weight onto the handlebars, sit very upright, experience neck discomfort, or find your torso dropping between your shoulder blades, your handlebars may be too high.
> 3. **Handlebars too low:** If you notice yourself rotating your pelvis forward to reach lower handlebars, experiencing increased pressure on the front of the saddle, adopting a rounded posture with scapular protraction, or feeling discomfort in the lower back or upper hamstrings, your handlebars might be too low.
> 4. **Riding in the drops:** If you naturally prefer riding in the drops position for extended periods, it could indicate that your handlebars are too high.
> 5. **Filming yourself:** Consider filming your riding from the side at various intensities (light, FTP, VO2 max). Pay close attention to your shoulder posture and how you feel on the bike.
> 6. **Adjust gradually:** Make small adjustments to your handlebar height based on your observations. Start by ensuring your bike's back end (seat height, seat setback, cleat position) is correctly set up before tweaking the handlebars.
> 7. **Test and iterate:** After making adjustments, test your new handlebar height and evaluate how it affects your riding comfort and efficiency. Be prepared to make further tweaks as needed.
