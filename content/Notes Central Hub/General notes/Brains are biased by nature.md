# Brains are naturally wired to be biased

According to the [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual thinking model]], a significant amount of our thinking, is done using the [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking system]] which primarily uses [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|heuristics]] to interpret information quickly. As a result, we are prone to bias which is a natural human tendency and that's okay.

## Bias is a natural human tendency

> [!ai]+ AI

> Having a bias is not inherently bad, as bias is a natural human tendency. Bias refers to the [[Inclination are personal preferences|inclination]] or prejudice for or against something or someone. It can be influenced by personal experiences, cultural background, beliefs, and various other factors. Biases can help individuals make quick judgments and decisions based on limited information.

Bias can lead us to become close-minded to new sources of information so it's important to [[Cognitive strategies to practice humility|practice humility]].

## Biases are problematic when they distort thinking or promote unfair treatment

> However, biases can become problematic when they lead to unfair treatment, discrimination, or hinder rational thinking. If biases are not recognized or acknowledged, they can reinforce stereotypes, perpetuate inequality, and impede open-mindedness. It is important to be aware of our biases and strive to mitigate their impact by seeking multiple perspectives, considering evidence objectively, and promoting inclusivity and fairness.

## Cognitive bias

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Cognitive bias refers to the systematic errors in thinking and decision-making that humans tend to make. These biases often stem from our brain's natural tendency to simplify information processing and rely on mental shortcuts. Cognitive biases can lead to errors in judgment, perception, and reasoning, influencing how we interpret and recall information. Common cognitive biases include [[confirmation bias]], where we seek out information that confirms our existing beliefs, and availability bias, where we rely on readily available examples or memories when making judgments. Understanding cognitive biases is important for critical thinking and making more [[Make informed decisions|informed decisions]].


## Biases are functional filters for the brain process information

Biases are the filters by which our [[Brains organize information into schemas|brain organizes information]].  These [[Process of communication|filters]] are acquired as a result of  [[How environmental factors affect brain development|environmental exposure]] and [[Personality is shaped our environment|upbringing]].  If one fails to gain [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.|awareness]], in other words, the ability to develop [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]] of these pitfall, we will become prone to developing errors in our judgement and susceptible to [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions making inaccurate judgments]].

The purpose of biases is the right of result of our inability to [[Working memory is limited|process excessive information]] - note that this is different from [[Information overconsumption|information overconsumption]]. So our brains may have evolved to use [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|heuristics]] and [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] instead of [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]] which is more expensive in terms of [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive resources]].

It can be important to step back and recognize when our biases are driving our decisions.

### Formal definition

> -   Cognitive biases are unconscious errors in thinking that arise from problems related to memory, attention, and other mental mistakes.
> -   These biases result from our brain’s efforts to simplify the incredibly complex world in which we live.
> -   [[confirmation bias]], hindsight bias, [self-serving bias](https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-serving-bias.html), anchoring bias, [availability bias](https://www.simplypsychology.org/availability-heuristic.html), [the framing effect](https://www.simplypsychology.org/framing-effect.html), and [inattentional blindness](https://www.simplypsychology.org/inattentional-blindness.html) are some of the most common examples of cognitive bias. Another example is the [false consensus effect](https://www.simplypsychology.org/false-consensus-effect.html).
> -   Cognitive biases have direct implications on our safety, our interactions with others, and the way we make judgments and decisions in our daily lives.
> -   Although these biases are unconscious, there are small steps we can take to train our minds to adopt a new pattern of thinking and mitigate the effects of these biases.

## Moving beyond the rational-actor model in decision-making

According to the following article, [We don’t have a hundred biases, we have the wrong model - Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/biases-the-wrong-model), we should seek to move beyond a dominant, rational actor model in terms of decision making.

> - The passage suggests it's time to move beyond the dominant rational-actor model of human decision-making.
> - The author compares this model to the geocentric model of the universe and argues that new theories are needed to explain deviations from rationality.
> - Collecting biases is useful, but lacks a theoretical framework.
> - Without a theoretical foundation, it's challenging to filter results, distinguish between theories, and replicate findings.
> - A new theoretical framework is needed to integrate biases and effects into a coherent model of decision-making.
> - Developing a unified framework may be challenging, but understanding decision-making is crucial for advancing behavioral economics.

This seems to make a lot of sense for me. Modern economics assumes that humans are perfectly rational, which is not really true. That is why the new [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual thinking model]] and advances in the [[neuroeconomics helps us understand how brains make decisions|field of neuroeconomics]] can be so powerful in terms of helping us understand human nature.
