Control theory assumes a linear system while dynamic system emphasizes non-linearity.

> Control theory is another approach to engineering that focuses on designing systems that can regulate or control the behavior of a dynamic system. Control theory and dynamic systems theory share some similarities, but there are also some key differences in their approach to modeling and controlling dynamic systems.
>
> One major difference is that control theory often assumes a linear model of the system, meaning that the relationship between the inputs and outputs of the system is assumed to be linear and predictable. In contrast, dynamic systems theory often focuses on nonlinear models of the system, which can capture the complex, emergent behavior that can arise from the interactions between multiple factors.
>
> Control theory also often uses mathematical models that are based on a specific set of assumptions about the system, such as the dynamics of the system, the inputs and outputs, and the noise or uncertainty in the system. These models are often designed to optimize a specific performance criterion, such as minimizing the error between the desired and actual behavior of the system.
>
> In contrast, dynamic systems theory often emphasizes the importance of data-driven modeling, where the behavior of the system is observed and modeled based on the actual behavior of the system, rather than on a predetermined set of assumptions. Dynamic systems theory also emphasizes the importance of feedback, where the behavior of the system is constantly monitored and adjusted in response to changing conditions, rather than relying on a fixed set of control parameters.
>
> Overall, while there is some overlap between control theory and dynamic systems theory, they represent different approaches to modeling and controlling dynamic systems, with different strengths and limitations depending on the specific application.
