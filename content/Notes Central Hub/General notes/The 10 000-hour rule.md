# The 10 000-hour rule

The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise.

In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: **ten thousand hours.**

## How researchers examined the road to becoming a chess grandmaster

> In 2005, a research team led by Neil Charness, a psychologist from Florida State University, published the results of a decades-long investigation of the practice habits of chess players.2 Throughout the nineties, Charness’s team had been placing ads in newspapers and posting flyers at chess tournaments, looking for ranked players to participate in their project. They ended up surveying over four hundred players, from around the world, in an effort to understand why some were better than others. Each player was given a form to fill out that requested a detailed history of the player’s chess instruction. The respondents were asked, in essence, to re-create a time line of their development as chess players: At what age did they start? What type of training did they receive at each year? How many tournaments did they play? Were they coached? How much? And so on.

> Previous studies had shown it takes around ten years, at minimum, to become a grand master. (As the psychologist K. Anders Ericsson likes to point out, even prodigies like Bobby Fisher managed to fit in ten years of playing before they achieved international recognition: He just started this accumulation earlier than most.)
