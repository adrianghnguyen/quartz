# Dual process theory explains our types of thinking - implicit and conscious reasoning

#status/done

Related to [[Cognitive Psychology]] and explained further in [[Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman]]

> The dual process theory explains that our reasoning and decision-making arise from two different thought processes (or two different systems): an automatic, unconscious process, and an explicit, conscious process.
>
> System 1 and System 2 encompass two different thought processes that people go through when making decisions, a theory known as “dual processing.”^[https://cxl.com/blog/dual-process-theory/#:~:text=Economics%20Nobel%20laureate%20Daniel%20Kahneman,known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cdual%20processing.%E2%80%9D]

> However, System 1 thinking is prone to biases and errors, which can lead us to make snap judgments and decisions that are not always accurate. In contrast, [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|System 2 thinking]] requires more effort, but it's more reliable and accurate.
>
> Kahneman suggests that we can improve our decision-making abilities by learning to recognize when we're using System 1 thinking and consciously switching to [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|System 2 thinking]] when necessary. This requires being aware of our cognitive biases and limitations and taking the time to engage in reflective thinking and analysis when making important decisions.

> In psychology, a dual process theory provides an account of how thought can arise in two different ways, or as a result of two different processes.
>
> Often, the two processes consist of an implicit (automatic), unconscious process and an explicit (controlled), conscious process. **Verbalized explicit** processes or attitudes and actions may change with persuasion or education; though **implicit process** or attitudes usually take a long amount of time to change with the forming of new habits.
>
> Dual process theories can be found in social, personality, cognitive, and clinical psychology. It has also been linked with economics via prospect theory and behavioral economics, and increasingly in sociology through cultural analysis.
