# Career capital is the currency to create work you love

A description of the skills you have that are **rare** and **valuable** to the working world. To master and acquire these unique skills, it's necessary to undergo a significant amount of [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]]. This is the key currency for having a successful [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career]] with meaningful work and requires the adoption of a [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsman mindset]]. This is something shared by [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport|So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]] as well as [[The organization 80 000 hours|The organization 80 000 hours]].

1. The [[Traits defining great work|traits that define great work]] are rare and valuable.
2. Supply and demand says that if you want these traits, you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return - in other words you'll need to [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|become an expert]]. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.
3. The [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsman mindset]], with its relentless focus on being “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. This is why it trumps the [[Why you shouldn't follow your passion for a successful career|passion mindset]] if your goal is to acquire career capital.

## Factors to consider in building career capital

These are five factors to consider in taking a new role and seeing if it will help increase our career capital. Otherwise, it may be worth [[Reject work opportunities with little advancement or with misaligned values|rejecting the opportunity.]]

1. Skills and knowledge - Will it increase my skills and knowledge?
2. Connections - What kind of people will I meet and will they be useful too my future career path?
3. Credentials - Will it help improve my professional standings and be recognized for future opportunities?
4. Character - Are the people who I work with people who will help me cultivate good morals and be an upstanding person? (are they kind? giving? don't do harm?)
5. Financial runway and flexibility - Will this role help increase my financial runway to provide me with flexibility of options?

> By “career capital,” we mean anything that puts you in a better position to make a difference or secure a fulfilling career in the future.
>
> We normally break it down into the following components, which you can use to compare your options in terms of career capital:
>
> - **Skills and knowledge:** What will you learn, how useful will it be, and how fast will you learn? A job will be best for learning when you are pushed to improve and get lots of feedback from mentors and colleagues. Ask yourself: “Where will I learn fastest?”
> - **Connections:** Who will you work with and meet? Will they include potential future collaborators on impactful projects, supportive friends and mentors, people who are influential, or people who will help you expand into new circles?
> - **Credentials:** We don’t just mean formal credentials like having a law degree, but also your achievements and reputation — or anything else that acts as a good signal to future collaborators or employers. If you’re a writer, it could be the quality of your blog. If you’re a coder, it might be your GitHub. If you’re interested in doing good, how can you show you’ve cultivated that interest?
> - **Character:** Will this option help you cultivate virtues like generosity, compasion, humility, integrity, honesty, good judgement, and respect of important norms? In particular, will you be able to work alongside people with good character (since that has a huge influence)? These traits are vital to being trusted, [working with others](https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/), and [not doing harm](https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/). They also determine whether, when faced with a high-stakes decision, you’ll be able to do what’s best for the world.
> - **Runway:** How much money will you save in this job? Your “runway” is how long you could comfortably live with no income. It depends on both your savings and how much you could reduce your expenses by. We recommend aiming for [at least six months of runway](https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-everyone-even-our-readers-should-save-enough-to-live-for-6-24-months/) to maintain your financial security, while 12–18 months of runway gives you the flexibility to make a major career change. It’s usually worth paying down high-interest debt before donating more than 1% per year or taking a big pay cut for greater impact.

### Consider environments which will foster career capital development

- Work at a growing organization that has a reputation for high performance that's aligned with the desired [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]]. If they grow quickly, there'll be room for advancement.
	- Smaller organizations provide more opportunities to branch out in skills. I think I prefer working at smaller organizations %% maybe between 70-200 at most? %%
	- Bigger organizations may provide more social capital/credentials
- Go to a [[Graduate school|graduate school]] for a carefully chosen subject after conscious deliberation
	- Does it fit personal interest?
	- Does it provide flexibility in terms of career opportunities and backup options (outside of academia?)
	- Is it relevant to [[My long-term goals and personal dreams|my long-term vision]]?

### Experiment to find your niche of career capital

[[Self-discovery is about trying new things|Just try things to discover more about your identity]] and discover where your unique skills lie. Then it's important to keep track of progress using [[Measure progress using KPIs|key performance indicator (KPI)]].

> [!note] “Until Something Comes Easily…”
>
> Like most entrepreneurs, I struggled through my first year of building a business.
>
> I launched my first product without having any idea who I would sell it to. (Big surprise, nobody bought it.) I reached out to important people, mismanaged expectations, made stupid mistakes, and essentially ruined the chance to build [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|good relationships]] with people I respected. I attempted to teach myself how to code, made one change to my website, and deleted everything I had done during the previous three months. To put it simply, I didn't know what I was doing.
>
> ## Make a Call About What to Focus On
>
> Assuming you're willing to try things and experiment a bit, the next question is, “How do I know what's coming easily to me?”
>
> The best answer I can give is to pay attention. Usually, this means [measuring something](https://jamesclear.com/measuring).
>
> - If you're an entrepreneur, track your marketing and promotion efforts.
> - If you're trying to gain muscle, [track your workouts](https://jamesclear.com/workout-journal).
> - If you're learning an instrument, [track your practice sessions](https://jamesclear.com/stop-procrastinating-seinfeld-strategy).
>
> Even when you do measure things, however, there comes a point where you have to make a call and [[Pareto principle|decide what to focus on]]. In my mind, this moment of decision is one of the central tensions of entrepreneurship.
>
> Do we continue [[Experiment by testing new ideas|trying new things]] or do we double down on one strategy? Do we try to innovate or do we commit to doing one thing well? Everyone wants to know the right time to simplify and focus on one thing, but nobody does. That's what makes success so hard. Entrepreneurship isn’t like baking a cake. There is no recipe. There is no guidebook. At this stage, your best option is to decide. You can't try everything. At some point, you don't need more information, you just need to make a choice.

## Career capital markets

When acquiring [[Career capital|career capital]] in a field, you can envision that you’re acquiring this capital in a specific type of career capital market. There are two types of these markets: **winner-take-all** and **auction**. Different markets require different career capital acquisition strategies.

### Winner-take-all market

There is only one type of career capital available and lots of different people competing for it.
You need to first “crack the code” on how people master the one skill that matters.
Example: *Screenwriters only need to be good at one thing - writing scripts*

### An auction market

Less structured market where many types of individual's career capitals may compete as a result of their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique experience]]. You might emphasize a rare combination of skills.

Example:  *Someone who can understand and communicate well with business users while possessing a deep technical expertise in software development*.
