## A study on daily planning vs monthly planning

> A study at the University of Wisconsin–Madison sought to understand how specific plans should be in helping people reach a goal. Researchers monitored college students who were in a program designed to help them study more effectively. The first group was told to make daily plans for studying, the second group was told to make monthly plans, and the third group was instructed to make no plans.
>
> The researchers expected that the daily planners would see the most improvement in studying, but unexpectedly, the monthly group did the best and were also the most likely to keep up their studying after the program and carry it into their work after college.
>
> The monthly planning was most effective because it did not deplete students of willpower or frustrate them when things went wrong, and it kept the goal intact when the daily routine was interrupted.
>
> Some goals may require daily planning, but the key is not to overwhelm your strength of will at the expense of the goal.^[Kirschenbaum, Daniel S., Humphrey, Laura L., and Malett, Sheldon D. “Specificity of Planning in Adult Self-Control: An Applied Investigation.” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 40, no. 5 (1981): 941–50.]
