> Samizdat was a form of self-publishing and distribution of literature in the Soviet Union during the era of censorship and repression. It involved copying, typing, and distributing underground literature or banned works through a network of individuals, often risking imprisonment or punishment by the government. The term "samizdat" comes from the Russian words "sam" (self) and "izdatelstvo" (publishing house). It was an important tool for dissidents to spread their ideas and challenge the ruling regime.

## Samizdat is important in science to combat entrenched ideologies

> Samizdat is a term that refers to the practice of self-publishing or distributing underground literature in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This practice emerged as a response to government censorship and control of information. Samizdat materials were typically typed or handwritten copies of texts that were deemed politically or socially unacceptable by the authorities.
>
> In the scientific community, samizdat has been reflected in cases where researchers have faced censorship or suppression of their work due to political, ideological, or religious reasons. For example, during the Cold War era, some scientists who conducted research on nuclear weapons faced restrictions on the publication of their findings. In some cases, they resorted to publishing their work through alternative channels, such as academic journals outside their home country or even samizdat networks.
>
> In more recent times, some scientists have faced challenges in publishing research that challenges prevailing ideologies or interests groups. This has been particularly evident in fields such as climate science and genetics where findings may be controversial or challenge established beliefs.
>
> Overall, while samizdat is not a common practice in modern science publishing due to greater freedom of expression and access to diverse publishing outlets, it is still relevant as a reminder of the importance of protecting academic freedom and [[open access to information]].
