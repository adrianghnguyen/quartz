> [!NOTE]- [How the Stories We Tell Ourselves Can Make or Break Us - Letters From Esther - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOujk6weKjA)
> The video titled "How the Stories We Tell Ourselves Can Make or Break Us - Letters From Esther" explores the impact of the narratives we construct about our lives and how they influence our attitudes, behaviors, and relationships. The speaker, Esther Perel, recounts a dinner party conversation where participants shared advice they would give to their 18-year-old selves, revealing that such advice is deeply tied to the context of their past experiences. She emphasizes that these stories shape our understanding of reality, connect us with others, and provide insights into our past, present, and future.
>
> Perel highlights that the stories we tell ourselves can empower us or hold us back. Some stories embolden us, while others keep us trapped in [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|limiting beliefs]]. The video delves into how these self-narratives are developed and how they impact our relationships and interactions. Perel examines common storylines people adopt, such as the need to be self-reliant due to past hardships or the fear of disappointment leading to emotional detachment.
>
> The speaker notes that while these stories may have served a purpose in the past, they can become hindrances in the present. Clinging to old narratives can prevent us from forming new beliefs and behaviors that align with our growth and evolving circumstances. Perel explains that recognizing when we are trapped in unproductive stories is crucial for personal development. She provides insights into identifying these stories and encourages reframing them to enable positive change.
>
> The video concludes by inviting viewers to engage in [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] and self-exploration. Perel suggests exercises to challenge existing narratives, fostering new perspectives and possibilities. By acknowledging the stories that shape our lives, we can break free from self-defeating patterns and create more fulfilling and authentic connections with others.

We each have a story we tell ourselves, whether it be conscious or not. That's why therapy can be so helpful to uncover the lost memories from our childhood. Perhaps we had a good childhood, or one which was [[Overcoming a bad childhood|poor]] - regardless what we learn at the time will become part of our personalities and [[You are not your inner critic|harmful messages]] become part of our [[The garden of shame metaphor|garden of shame]].

Most of the time, we're operating on a [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|heuristic level]] rather than engaging in [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|deliberate thinking]], as explained by the [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual thinking model]]. These [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|automatic thoughts]] drive our [[Emotions are interlinked with biology|behavioural responses and emotions]]. When it comes to unrooting our [[The garden of shame metaphor|garden of shame]], it can be helpful to to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe perspective]] in order to build a more positive mental image of the world in order to [[Moving on from the past|healing from the past]].

When our stories from our past keep us trapped, we can identify them as [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|limiting beliefs which prevent us from making progress in life]]. It can be hard at times feeling like there is possibilty of finding success in life when I feel weighed down by my [[mental illness]] - something explored further in this podcast [[REF Having a successful career with depression, anxiety, and imposter syndrome|REF Having a successful career with depression, anxiety, and imposter syndrome]].

## Revisiting our past constructively is adding new colours to our painting

Esther Perel uses the metaphor of a painting to describe our [[Coherence is understanding our life narrative|life story]]. The point of therapy and [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] is to add new colours to our life canvas. It can be difficult to craft new meaning from the past but it can help us [[Moving on from the past|move on]]. 

When we [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|feel stuck]], we are most likely repeating the same [[Shame and guilt are inherited|negative messages we have incorporated subconsciously into our minds]]. [[Strategies for behavioural change|Changing behaviour]] is a process which takes [[Active practice leads to skill development|deliberate time and effort]].

## What story do I tell myself of my foray into adulthood?

Our personal histories can sometimes have a weird sense of rhyme.

I started off in electrical engineering because I thought I wanted to work with circuits and devices. Originally, I didn't put much thought into what program to go in. Even then, I had

Then I wanted to understand myself so I went into [[_MOC Psychology|psychology]]. But I realised I'm also good at analysis so I complemented it with doing business cases/concentration in business which I did well in. But then I realised I really data and ended up working in the technology field. Which is a close mix of business/tech/psychology (humans interpret it).

But what I'm starting to realize recently is that I love knowledge and information processing (in the definition that it's signals/data about the world). I just like to understand how the world works in a very abstract form. Which is why I think cognitive science/computational neuroscience/artificial intelligence interests me.

If you wanted to put more words to a thing, out of the three books I've read, all have the common theme of a tech person going into something related to the brain like neuroscience or cognitive psychology. They're some of the people who help [[Personal sources of inspiration|inspire me]].

- [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|Andy Matuschak]] from iOS does cognitive research
- Don Norman from [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]] went from design to become a cognitive researcher.
- Demis hassabis who founded [[Thoughts on the AlphaGo documentary|AlphaGo]] went from software engineer to neuroscientist researcher.

I guess I'd say in a loose way [[Personal sources of inspiration|they inspire me]] as well and they combine tech to understand how humans understand the world under the field of [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]]. How do I make sense of this in [[My career mission|my career mission]]?

Tldr; at least to me, understanding how our brains work/[[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]] is a big directive.

I would say that in a way, technology is applied science. And science is understanding how the world works. So a logical extension is understanding our brains using technology. [[Curiosity as my worldview|Curiosity is my worldview.]]
