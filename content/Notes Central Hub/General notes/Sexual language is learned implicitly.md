## Sexual language is learned trhrough observation

We learn the sexual language through observations of our [[Personality is shaped our environment|environment]]. There's no such thing as **innate sexual stimuli**. Essentially, what [[SES and SIS are stable individual traits|turns us on and turns us off]], are learned from culture (See [[Cultural roots of shame]]).  We respond based on our prior experiences, it is learned [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|implicit thinking]] as explained within the [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual processing]] theory of thinking. Our brains learned to associate particular stimuli to arousal or inhibition through [[Context affects midbrain response to stimuli|stimuli response to context]].

## Learned sexual behaviour is different between sexes

Because women have different hormonal cycles (menstruation), as well as [[Homology aka same parts organized differently|different configuration of genitals]], they will learn sexually relevant [[Priming effects|stimuli]] differently from men
