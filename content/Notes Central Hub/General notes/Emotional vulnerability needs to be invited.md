> In this video titled "Inviting Vulnerability into Your Relationships - Letters From Esther Live," Esther Perel discusses the topic of how to invite vulnerability into relationships. She starts by referencing a previous exercise where participants wrote letters to loved ones, discussing how the desire to invite a partner to be vulnerable is a common concern. Esther Perel explains that inviting vulnerability involves creating an environment of trust and closeness, emphasizing that vulnerability is a two-way street where both partners need to take risks. She explores the cultural perspectives on intimacy and how sharing vulnerabilities has become associated with modern definitions of intimacy.

She discusses the importance of understanding and respecting each partner's boundaries when it comes to sharing vulnerabilities, and how different gestures and acts can also signify vulnerability. Perel encourages individuals to reflect on their own relationships with vulnerability and how they respond to their partner's vulnerabilities. She emphasizes the need for acceptance and empathy when dealing with a partner's struggles, including mental health issues and personal insecurities. She also addresses the complexities of attachment and authenticity in relationships, highlighting the balance between maintaining one's identity while also staying connected with a partner.

> The video concludes with Perel advising viewers to communicate openly, ask the right questions, and give partners the space they need to share vulnerabilities. She suggests writing love letters, metaphorically or literally, to initiate conversations about vulnerabilities, even if there's no expectation of receiving a letter in return. Perel's approach is centered on fostering a safe space for vulnerability to be expressed and acknowledged, ultimately deepening the bonds within a relationship.
