# Become someone who is more empathetic by not blaming others

> [!NOTE] An anecdote on Valve from playtesters
> While Valve, the video game company, was doing playtesting of Half-Life Episode 1, they discovered that NPCs who are *constantly nagging* by directing people how to solve something *made them hate the character*.  "Players much preferred to set the pace themselves and that they especially disliked virtually any hint of bossiness from Alyx."

It's important to separate the need to [[Continuous feedback leads to change|provide feedback]] from attacking the other person. Sometimes, we are [[Fundamental Attribution Error|victim of circumstances rather than a particular innate trait]]. We should [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|honour our connection]]. Criticism can often come from a place of low [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] in order to re-establish our [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]]. It's a form of [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanism]].

Perhaps a better approach is to simply [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|owning my feelings]] and then deciding what to do after. [[Treat poor behaviour with kindness|Treat poor behaviour with kindness]].

## Personal reflections on critical voices

I often have high expectations of others, as I do for myself - perhaps stemming from a sense of [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]]. [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|I need to accept this about myself]] so I can learn to let go and move on.

However, it is not fair to impart these judgements on others. Perhaps they are happy as they are, or perhaps I am wrong to judge in the first place after all. I may have failed to consider [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|alternative perspectives]].

Growing up, [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] would be a very critical woman, often saying this is the right way of doing things. I think I learned to turn this into [[Dealing with our inner critic|self-hatred]] as well as making up for my [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|fragile ego]] by [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|attacking others]].

I guess this rubs off on me and I feel the need to always tell others to do things the way that I should. Do realize that this can be a strength in the chase of constant self-improvement but taken to an extreme will only [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|harm the relationship]].
