In the past, the study of consciousness was primarily considered to be a philosophical inquiry. However, over the last few decades, there has been a significant shift in this field, with more and more researchers turning to science to understand consciousness.

One of the main reasons for this shift is that advances in neuroscience and cognitive psychology have provided new tools and methods for investigating the brain and its functions. This has allowed researchers to explore the neural correlates of consciousness and gain insights into how conscious experiences arise from neural activity.

Another factor contributing to this shift is a growing recognition of the importance of empirical evidence in understanding complex phenomena like consciousness. While philosophical arguments can be compelling, they often lack the rigor and precision of scientific investigation.

As a result of these developments, many universities now offer dedicated programs in consciousness studies that integrate philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, and other disciplines. These programs allow students to explore questions like: What is consciousness? How does it relate to brain function? Can we create conscious machines?

Overall, this shift from philosophy to science has brought new perspectives and insights to our understanding of consciousness. By combining rigorous empirical methods with philosophical reasoning, researchers are making progress towards unraveling one of the greatest mysteries of human experience.---

> Consciousness, at its simplest, is sentience and awareness of internal and external existence… In some explanations, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind.^[Wikipedia]

Consciousness then would be quite related to the study of psychology. Qualia is the term used to refer to the individual vignettes which form the whole of consciousness.

> Consciousness is everything you experience. It is the tune stuck in your head, the sweetness of chocolate mousse, the throbbing pain of a toothache, the fierce love for your child and the bitter knowledge that eventually all feelings will end.^[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-consciousness/]

Many of the people asking the nature of this question have abandoned trying to assess it from a philosophical perspective but rather look for physical evidence of it - science.

> What is it about a highly excitable piece of brain matter that gives rise to consciousness? Once we can understand that, we hope to get closer to solving the more fundamental problem.

> We seek, in particular, the neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC), defined as the minimal neuronal mechanisms jointly sufficient for any specific conscious experience. What must happen in your brain for you to experience a toothache, for example? Must some nerve cells vibrate at some magical frequency? Do some special “consciousness neurons” have to be activated? In which brain regions would these cells be located?

The logical leap then to understand consciousness is to then begin examining the brain and its physical mechanisms. It's the [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual shift]] from merely thinking to doing ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]]) at the macro scale. From philosophy to applied science and research.
