## Difference between the morality and ethics

**Morality** refers to the set of values, principles, and beliefs that individuals or societies use to distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and just from unjust actions. It is a subjective and culturally dependent concept that reflects the norms and customs of a particular society or community. Morality is concerned with issues of personal character, such as honesty, integrity, and empathy, as well as social behavior, such as fairness, justice, and compassion.

**Ethics**, on the other hand, refers to the systematic study of morality and the rational justification of moral principles and values. It is concerned with the development and application of moral theories, concepts, and frameworks that provide a basis for ethical decision-making and action. Ethics seeks to identify and evaluate the moral principles that underlie human behavior and to provide guidance for moral reasoning and behavior in various domains of life, such as medicine, law, business, and politics.

In summary, while morality refers to the subjective set of values and beliefs that distinguish right from wrong, good from bad, and just from unjust actions, ethics is the systematic study and rational justification of moral principles and values. Ethics provides a framework for evaluating and making moral judgments and for guiding moral behavior in different contexts, while morality reflects the social and cultural norms and values of a particular community or society.

### Explained simply

- Morality refers to the beliefs and principles that people use to determine what is right and wrong, good and bad, or just and unjust.
- Ethics is the study of morality and how to make good moral decisions in different situations.

Think of it this way: morality is like a **set of rules** that people follow to be a good person, while **ethics is like a guidebook** that helps people figure out what to do when they are faced with a moral dilemma.
