## Explaining the drunk island metaphor of ai

[[2023-03-09 Thu]] I was listening to a seminar on "Will AI replace [[User experience design|UX design]]" with [[Rebecca Chong]] and the presenter, John Zimmer from Carnegie Mellon University, said that the Chief Data Scientist, Cassie Kozyrkov at Google explained the current state of our [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] which we can metaphorize as decision-making by  [an island of drunk people](https://hackernoon.com/imagine-a-drunk-island-advice-for-finding-ai-use-cases-8d47495d4c3f).

Long story short, she explains it as a bunch of drunk people who can **quickly** come to a conclusion but may be inaccurate. Sounds familiar - that's [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking]] which is based off [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|heuristics]]. AI in its current state is not able to do [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2]] thinking.

> Decision Intelligence is an interdisciplinary field concerned with all aspects of decision-making. It combines Data Science (statistics, machine learning, AI, analytics) with the Behavioral Sciences (psychology, neuroscience, economics, and the managerial sciences).

> I serve as a thought leader in this **new discipline**, guiding Google and the world in making safe, effective use of AI and data.^[https://www.linkedin.com/in/kozyrkov/]

That's justâ€¦[[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] isn't it? Might be interesting to go work for her one day ([[My career reflections and planning]]).

## Introduction of entropy by artificial intelligence models and creativity

It can mainly infer from patterns but truly introducing entropy - new "novel" inputs into the system is yet to come. I was researching the basics of diffusion learning models (related to [[Stable diffusion models]]?) such as DALL-E or other generative AI models like MindJourney. Essentially, they learn a giant dataset, but then iterate within this context space using human inputs as guiding variables/weights.

However, I have my doubts that this kind of AI can generate 'innovation' as in a reductive sense, it's doing advanced pattern matching. I'll learn more information as I review [[Artificial Intelligence For Dummies by John Paul Mueller Luca Massaron]].
