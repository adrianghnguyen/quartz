# Love your authentic self by believing you are enough

> [!quote] Authenticity, said by Brené Brown
> To [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|be authentic]], **we must cultivate the courage to be imperfect—and [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerable]]**. We have to believe that we are fundamentally worthy of love and acceptance, just as we are. I've learned that there is no better way to invite more grace, gratitude and joy into our lives than by mindfully practicing authenticity.

Authenticity is the ability to be bridge the gap between your inner-self and your external image or reducing the between your [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego and superego]]. It's also becoming emotionally attuned to our inner selves and letting go of [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]]. It's about building [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]] and [[Self-respect|showing respect to yourself and your needs]].

As a child, it is one of the rare times we are authentic as we have not learned the need to conform to society. As we grow up, we become influenced by society's image such as culture, stereotypes/biases and [[Personality is shaped our environment|upbringing]]. We each have our own 

When we lessen the gap between ego and the superego aka [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|self-realization]],  we no longer feel the need to prove anything. This allows us to cultivate self-love which is the root of authenticity. From there, we can [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|begin living authentically]]

Humans within their nature are looking to constantly grow in order to find purpose and meaning through [[Brains organize information into schemas|mental schemas]] in order to make sense of one's world. With a [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]], this can manifest itself as the desire to pursue mastery and expertise to develop competence.

## Children act with true authenticity

Children tend to be pure in their actions, acting with true authenticity free of cultural imprint.

I believe that one of the first steps is to retrace and recognize our journey thus far in life. When we are born, we have no preconceptions - eyes wide open with curiosities free of imprints and [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive biases]]. Children are the purest form of authenticity. Notice how free they are in terms of expressing their thoughts and acting with [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|curiosity]].

Often times, our parents are the key figures to [[Personal reflections on my childhood|our childhood]]. Babies are incredibly apt at imitation - they will learn how you react to situations.

Do you react with violence? Anger? Understanding? This becomes their future model for dealing with future events. We add in a societal layer where we have [[Cultural roots of shame|culture, media and others]] around us telling us various conflicting messages.

## My journey in developing authenticity

I am writing this today that even though I understand this position, it doesn't mean that my [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]] is unaffected. It still does and I need to practice [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|letting thoughts flow by through free attention]]. It's definitely a journey with few following a linear path.

Nevertheless, the practice of [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] has helped me reinforce the message *"[[The various ways of loving yourself|I am okay the way I am]]"* into my subconscious. It means that when I do notice myself [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|feeling hurt]], I can begin [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|identifying the reasons why]] - this means [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|making connections]] between my past and the present situation to realize possible [[Priming effects|priming effects]] and [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood or past]].

We may need external help in order to draw these connections between our past sources of hurt and our present [[Priming effects|responses]]. Incorporating techniques from [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|CBT]] may be useful in order to provide us enough buffer from our guttural reactions to bring up [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|higher level]] [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]] online, instead of reliance on our [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|limbic system]].

As a result, [[Why therapy is so difficult|discussions with a therapist]] as well as deep [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] and [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] are effective tools. When [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]], it'll be helpful to [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|keep asking yourself why]] until you find fundamental truths through [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|first principles thinking]].

The reason why pursuing authenticity may so discomforting may due to its close relationship to [[Fear|fear]], [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurity]] and [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]].
