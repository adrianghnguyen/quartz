> # Chronic Dissatisfaction and the Pursuit of Happiness
> Everyone experiences the ubiquitous feeling that life is not as it should be. It manifests as pangs of dissatisfaction—the feeling of not being successful enough, of struggling relationships, and unfulfilled desires. Our modern-society accelerates these feelings through pop culture, advertising, and social media. These elements continually remind us to aim for perfection and make us believe, erroneously, that anything less than achieving our dreams equates to failure.
>
> Some of the most prized indicators of happiness and success include landing our dream jobs, having myriad friends, and finding our soulmates; and social media flaunts pictures of people who seemingly have accomplished all these. Advertisement and self-improvement products exacerbate the feeling of inadequacy, often implying that you are culpable for not working hard enough to fix the dissatisfaction.
>
> ## Evaluating Dissatisfaction
> As this issue gained momentum, researchers over the past two decades started looking into how we can neutralize these feelings. This resulted in the emergence of the field of [[Positive Psychology|positive psychology]], focusing on the study of what makes life worth living. Simultaneously, [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]] was developed to alleviate negative feelings.
>
> Researchers began investigating why some people seemed happier and more satisfied than others. Consequently, they pursued determining if there were ways to transfer what the happier population was doing right to the rest of society.
>
> ## Gratitude: The Antidote to Dissatisfaction
> One of the strongest predictors of happiness is gratitude—it greatly influences how happy people are, how easily they form relationships, and their ability to cope with adversity. While gratitude may be passed off as another self-improvement trend endorsed by lifestyle influencers, the theory is backed by robust scientific research.
>
> Gratitude refers to different things to different people depending on the context. It can be a character trait, virtue, emotion, or behavior. You can be grateful to someone who did something kind for you, random occurrences such as the weather, or nature or fate. It forms an integral part of our biological makeup.
>
> ### 1: Gratitude as the Link to Societal Connection
> The ancient form of gratitude is likely reciprocity—it probably evolved as a biological signal that encouraged animals to exchange items for mutual benefit. This can be observed among certain species of fish, birds, mammals, and particularly in primates.
>
> Gratitude encourages you to repay kindness, hence fostering caring relationships with others. As humans became proficient in reading emotions, selfish individuals were identified and ostracized. Thus, it became evolutionarily advantageous to build relationships.
>
> #### 2: The Ripple Effects of Gratitude
> Researchers discovered that gratitude stimulates areas in the brain responsible for reward feelings, forming social bonds, and interpreting others' intentions. Gratitude also aids in storing and recalling positive memories. Moreover, it directly negates negative feelings and traits like envy, narcissism, cynicism, materialism, and social comparison.
>
> People who foster gratitude typically report greater happiness, satisfaction, relationship quality, and resilience. They are also less susceptible to depression, addiction, burnout, and traumatic events.
>
> #### 3: Cultivating More Gratitude
> Though everyone possesses the ability to experience gratitude—termed trait gratitude—its capability varies greatly. Trait gratitude depends on your genetic makeup, personality, and cultural influence.
>
> An easy method to nurture gratitude is through journaling. It involves dedicating few minutes, one to three times a week, to write down things you are grateful for. Regular practising of such gratitude exercise not only induces happiness but also improves life satisfaction.
>
> ### Conclusion
> From various studies, it is evident that gratitude is an effective antidote to chronic dissatisfaction. It involves acknowledging the positive aspects of your life, an action that fosters positive emotions and experiences.
>
> Being human can be challenging, but it doesn't need to be as tough. If you intentionally look for it, you might realize that your life is actually much more gratifying than you thought.
