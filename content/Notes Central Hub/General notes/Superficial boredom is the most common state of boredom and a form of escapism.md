# Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism

Related to [[The philosophical source of boredom]]

Superficial boredom is the **most common state** of boredom. It is the common feeling of restlessness familiar to us all. It also may be the avoidance of deeper concerns such as feelings of [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|personal threats]] and may help explain why we engage in procrastination. 

For example, we might feel bored in a situation in a situation such as waiting for a train, where we escape from everyday life, [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|possibly in order avoid stress]]. It is easy to turn ourselves into the addictive dopamine loops of [[Social media is a poor cure for boredom|doom scrolling]] or seeking other alternative forms of escapism instead of confronting the uncomfortable thought. We might decide to whip out our cellphone or [[Social media is a poor cure for boredom|constantly scroll through our social media feeds]].

This has a negative impact on our physical health and negatively impacting our mental health as a result while the [[The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel A Van der Kolk|body keeps the score of stress]]. It does not simple leave us - it remains beneath, despite our best ability to [[Emotional suppression and denial|suppress these emotions]].

It might be a way for us to [[Evolutionary purpose of pain is to steer away from potential harm|avoid pain]], whether it be physical or [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional pain]] and leads us to become impulsive with a reduced [[Being patient leads to better decisions|capacity for patience]]. We could also experience it as an intense desire to find emotional numbness by adopting [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive coping strategies]].

Experiencing high stress, from forms such as [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] or [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] reduces our ability to engage in [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|higher level thinking]] as we have a [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mindset]]  and look to converse resources, becoming closed-off as a method of [[Self-protection and anxiety avoidance|self-protection in order to reduce anxiety]]. Sometimes, it may mean that we enter poor habits instead of engaging in positive growth.

## The mind is always greedy for more

> [!quote]
> The mind exists in a state of "not enough" and so is always greedy for more. When you are identified with mind, you get bored and restless very easily. Boredom means the mind is hungry for more stimulus, more food for thought, and its hunger is not being satisfied.
>
> When you feel bored, you can satisfy the mind's hunger by picking up a magazine, making a phone call, switching on the TV, surfing the web, going shopping, or — and this is not uncommon — **transferring the mental sense of lack and its need for more to the body and satisfy it briefly by ingesting more food.**
>
> **Or you can stay bored and restless and [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|observe what it feels like to be bored and restless]].** As you bring [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|awareness]] to the feeling, there is suddenly some space and stillness around it, as it were. A little at first, but as the sense of inner space grows, the feeling of boredom will begin to diminish in intensity and significance. So even boredom can teach you who you are and who you are not.
>
> You discover that a "bored person" is not who you are. **Boredom is simply a conditioned energy movement within you.** Neither are you an angry, sad, or fearful person. Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not "yours," not personal. They are [[Human condition is our common shared experiences on this earth|conditions]] of the human mind. They come and go.
>
> Nothing that comes and goes is you. "I am bored." Who knows this? "I am angry, sad, afraid." Who knows this? You are the knowing, not the condition that is known.
>\- Stillness Speaks by Eckhart Tolle

Would it be related to the [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|hedonic treadmill]]?
## Superficial boredom is the inability to stay in the present

> Boredom is nothing more than **our lack of ability to ground into the present**. When we learn to see what is really going on, boredom will fall away like yesterday's news.
>
> Boredom in this sense is perfect, it's a chance to reckon with your deeply reinforces patterns of mindless habituation which only serve up dissatisfaction and discomfort, your strong pattern of distraction, with your accumulated karma. Allow boredom to ripen, [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|stay with the moment]], and get beyond it rather than giving into it. You'll emerge with more wisdom, and less tendency towards boredom in the future. Keep doing that, and you will never be bored again.
