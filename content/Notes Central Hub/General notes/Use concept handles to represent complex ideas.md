# Concept handles help us encapsulate difficult concepts

> [!NOTE] What are concept handles?
> A concept handle is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic such as “prisoner’s dilemma”

Concept handles are useful because they form a [[Gestalt Principles|gestalt]] of prior thoughts with their own pre-suppositions and assumptions.

It helps elevate the floor of cognitive processing by [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|reducing cognitive load]] as it helps establish common ground with someone else when [[Process of communication|communicating with others]]. There is less explanation of definition and foundational building blocks, allowing conversations to reach deeper levels.

We know from [[Priming effects|priming effects]]  that using specific words allows us to recall information more quickly due to pre-established [[Brains organize information into schemas|brain schemas]].

> A “concept handle” is a memorable noun phrase representing a complex, often abstract topic. For example: “prisoner’s dilemma,” “Overton window,” “belief in belief,” etc. In my own writing, examples include [Enabling environment](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3DaBP4vN1dutjUgrk3jbEeNxScccvDCxDgXe), [Enacted experience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3KASfpz5AmNmqM2m517Jbs1EvXrLN7NkeYWH), etc. The “concept handle” is a concept handle for itself, coined by [Scott Alexander](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z6y6cuKoEnMAJ25ad1fFPqcB3DW1T5jeG9XNu).

> Successful concept handles can really amplify a vague idea which many people sort of understand but can’t point to and talk about. If you give that vague notion a crisp, catchy name, you can unlock a lot of conversation and reflection. Per Alexander:
>
> I’m not too likely to discover some entirely new social phenomenon that nobody’s ever thought about before. But there are a lot of things people have vague nebulous ideas about that they can’t quite put into words. Changing those into [crystal-clear](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/03/15/can-it-be-wrong-to-crystallize-patterns/) ideas they can manipulate and discuss with others is a big deal.

> If you figure out something interesting and very briefly cram it into somebody else’s head, don’t waste that! Give it a nice concept-handle so that they’ll remember it and be able to use it to solve other problems!
>
> One way to think about concept handles is as “APIs for concepts.” In this sense, the idea connects to my thinking about [Evergreen note titles are like APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XP5GRmd9z1D2qCE7pxUvbeSVeQuMiqz9x1C).
