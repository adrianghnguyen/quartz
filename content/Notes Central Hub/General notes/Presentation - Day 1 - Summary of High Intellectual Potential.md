# High intellectual potential

---

## Defining high intellectual potential

- [[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process|High intellectual potential  is the modern scientific concept consolidating views on talent, giftedness and potential for intelligence.]]
- High intellectual potential is a set of behaviours, born of one's innate traits which *can* be developed into talent with **enough effort and motivation**. It is heritable.

---

## What are the forms by which high intellectual potential can manifest itself?

---

### Many types of competencies and potential talents

- May manifest itself as above average [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]]:
	- sports
	- a musical ear
	- logic/reasoning
	- social skills
	- etc.
- It is possible for a child to be gifted in one or more categories.
---

### Two primary archetypes - laminar and complex

- To give a greater umbrella of classification of the manifestation of high intellectual potential, we can consider it as [[Types of Giftedness and High Intellectual Potential|laminar (homogenous) or complex (heterogenous)]].
- In simpler terms, there are two main archetypes: the 'scientist' and the 'creative artist'. A child is more likely than not to be a mix of both.

## What does a potentially gifted child look like and behave?

### Behaviour and traits

- Immensely [[Traits and Behaviors of HPI|curious, lucid, asks a lot of questions and with an interest in complex subjects]]
- They might possess above average energy, imagination and creativity.

---

### Individual differences

- Gifted children have been demonstrated to have alternate information processing pathways to their brains.

---

### Hypersensitivity

- A large number of them would tend to be [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitive]] - having stronger than the norm's reaction to **sensory** or **emotional experiences**.
- This would include things like lights, hunger, heat, cold, pain, etc.

---

## What role does high intellectual potential play in our society?

- There are many [[Societal view on giftedness|myths and misunderstandings within our society]] on what giftedness implies.
- [[Talent is dedication by few|Not every child has the potential for talent]] as part of it is due to inherent biological factors.
- Remember that high intellectual potential is a talent development process which still requires enormous effort and deliberate practice.
---

## What are the related scientific theories surrounding intelligence, giftedness and talent?

---

### Scientific theories on intelligence and high intellectual potential

- Scientists have attempted to find a grand theory explaining the roots of humans' [[General Intelligence Factor|general intelligence aka 'g' factor]]
- Current belief posits that we have [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences|multiple types of intelligence sectors]] within our brain depending on the activity

---

#### Current understanding of giftedness

- Our [[Three Ring Conception of Giftedness by Renzulli|main conceptual model of giftedness]] stems from Renzulli's three defining pillars of the gifted child:
	- Above average [[Natural and acquired competencies|competencies]]
	- [[Theories of creativity and motivation|Creativity]]
	- Grit or [[Talent is dedication by few|incredible commitment to task performance]]
---

### Potential theories on biological advantage

- [[Theory of Neural Efficiency|'Smarter' brains process glucose, its energy source, more efficiently]]
- Gifted children have [[Developmental and Cognitive Characteristics of Highly Gifted Children|more efficient REM sleep cycles]], allowing them to sleep less while processing more information in a shorter amount of time sleep.
---

## What is the double-edged sword of high intellectual potential?

- Giftedness is a strength
- [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|Twice exceptionality]] (ADHD, learning difficulties, autism spectrum disorder, and/or mental health issues) is a **vulnerability** in potentially talented children.
---

## What do we mean by giftedness is talent development process?

---

### Time to reach potential

Most gifted children will not realize the [[Stages of talent development|full potential of their talent until the third stage of talent development - the culmination phase]] which only typically occurs during adulthood. 

---

### Dedication and effort

This long journey towards **high performance** requires [[Talent is dedication by few|enormous dedication from the gifted child]] to pursue deliberate practice in a domain of interest.

---

### Chance and supportive factors

However, all of this can only happen with the [[Ingredients for HPI Development|combination of chance, and a multitude of factors]].

Type of factor | Details
--|--
Internal or innate | Creativity, motivation, above average competencies
External or [[You are shaped by your product of your environment|environmental]] | Mentorship, opportunities of development, support of their community and involved parents

---

## What do parents need to know about their potentially gifted child?

---

### The exceptional case of gifted children

Parenting isn't easy - and doubly so when the gifted child has unique and demanding needs.

[[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself]] but I think things can be better.

---

### Learn how to identify talent

- The first step is to [[Identifying talent types for HPI|identify if your child has potential talents]]
- Indicators may include your potentially gifted child having [[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI|earlier developmental milestones]] than their peers

---

### Guiding parenting principles for gifted children development

- Practice an [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|authoritative parenting style]]
- Encourage the development of strong values (family cohesion, self-improvement, etc.)
- Seek to understand the exceptional nature of giftedness

Gifted children have particular [[Educational Needs of Gifted Children|educational needs]] such as need for autonomy, initiative, and complex challenges.

---

### Use best parenting practices

These are supported by scientific research within the domain.

- practicing **empathy**
- providing **unconditional support**
- **listening actively** to their unique sensitive needs and emotions.
