## 'g' or general intelligence factor

Researchers have tried for many years to define our general intelligence, commonly referred to as the 'g' factor within scientific literature. it's an elusive concept. One common bastardization of the concept is the [[IQ Test]].

## Debates over the definition of 'g'

### Mainly a psychometric approach

Some researchers as a way to operationalize/quantify intelligence within psychometric assessments - it's a multivariate of the sum of aptitudes. Others use it as a synonym for reasoning which is believed to be the heart of intelligence. ^[p.67 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.]

This particular definition is often defined as a mathematical term - a psychometric approach.
