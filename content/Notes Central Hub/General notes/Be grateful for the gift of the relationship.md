Honoring social bonds means that we recognize that when we are [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|communicating with someone]] else, we care about the [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|friendship]] and the relationship that we have with the other person.

It means that we should try to not bring in our [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanisms]] and recognize when our [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]] is getting in the way of us actually creating a connection with each other.

Recognize that [[Traits and qualities of strong relationships|high quality relationships]] bring us much joy and happiness and is worth holding in mind even during [[Best practices for handling relationship conflicts|conflict in a relationship]]. It's [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being appreciative]] of the person and [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|welcoming others into our lives]].

Most people are not out to get us. They simply come from [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|different personal experiences]] and different perspectives in life. When we do become hurt, we should [[Tong-Len philosophy is exchanging hurt for empathy|exchange feelings of hurt for empathy]]  and seek to [[Forgiveness increases well-being|practice forgiveness in our relationships]] instead.

## Recognizing the direct moment of social connection

It also means that we should [[Be less critical of others by taking a pause to reflect|be less judgmental]] by [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|staying empathetic]] through [[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|non-violent communication]] to communicate our [[Personal needs as a human being|personal needs]]. It means placing our feelings above criticism and remembering the love we have for one another above ill will.

## Failure to honor social bonds will cause loneliness

If we don't practice some [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|self-awareness]] while we speak, we may end up shouting each other and create [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|misunderstandings]] because we come from a place of [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|hurt feelings]]. By [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|practicing empathy]] and recognizing that most people don't have [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|ill intent]], we can maintain a higher level of communication and understanding.

This will cause a sense of alienation and causes us to [[Loneliness and its negative impact on health|become lonely]] and [[Fear of rejection|feel rejected]] by the other person. It might also rob us at the opportunity of further developing [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|meaningful relationships]].
