# Egoistic altruism is recognizing that lifting others also elevates ourselves

Related to [[REF A Selfish Argument for Making the World a Better Place aka Egoistic Altruism]]

Kurzgesagt makes a great point for egoistic altruism which is realizing that by enlarging the pie in a positive sum environment allows everyone to benefit - including you. Therefore, as a selfish motivation, you should seek to raise others up as it spurs further innovation and well-being of the population.

> -   Majority of the world's population used to work on farms and the economy was limited by the fixed size of land, making it a zero-sum game.
> -   Industrial Revolution led to an unprecedented increase in economic output, changing the world from zero-sum to positive-sum game.
> -   [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|Innovation]] is the core of this transformation, and it leads to better solutions to existing problems and solutions to problems that were previously unknown.
> -   In a positive-sum world, it is in your personal selfish best interest that every human on the planet is well-off.
> -   The more people are well-off, the better your own life is because innovation follows incentives.
> -   Improving the lives of those who are worst off has a multiplying effect, increasing demand for ideas while at the same time, making it easier for ideas to be produced.
> -   The more people want the same thing that you want, the more likely you are to get it, and that is what it means to live in a positive-sum world.
> -   Working on a better world is a very good thing to do for others and for yourself.

## Positive psychology supports why we should help each other out

According to [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]], helping others out is how we become the happiest. Help yourself to help others as well. Well being generates itself and grows when we are able to share it. We don't need to be happy at each other's expense.

In a way, it's karma coming up back to us. Similar to [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula|What the Buddha Taught]].

## Selfishness can be mutually beneficial

It's interesting to know that, even within classical economic theory, as well as neuroeconomics suggests that self-interest is directed towards mutually beneficial outcomes for optimal gains.

> The Economist and Philosopher Adam Smith wrote two notable books called _The Theory of Moral Sentiments_ in which he proposed that sympathy for others drives moral behavior, and _An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_ in which he argued that self-interest benefits both nations and individuals in the co-creation of the common good for the mutual benefit of all..

> [[Doctor Paul Zak pioneered the field of neuroeconomics|Neuroscientist and Economist Paul Zak]] has studied the brain and body at the intersection of selfish and giving behaviors. Zak’s lab showed that we release the neuropeptide oxytocin when we engage in prosocial behavior. In fact, the *brain’s engineering produces empathy that drives us toward virtue* and away from vice. It turns out that oxytocin reinforces the positive feelings we derive from empathy as well as relieving our aversion to social interactions.

> The research suggests that this ancient evolutionary molecule called oxytocin drives prosocial behavior and benefits our lives and the lives of others. It might seem like a contradiction to say that our self-interest benefits others, but the research suggests that acting in the interests of others actually benefits ourselves and the world around us. On a global level, Adam Smith suggested that two parties could benefit from self-interest. On an individual level, our brains are programmed and wired to also direct self-interest toward mutually beneficial outcomes for ourselves and those around us.^[Zak, Paul J. "The physiology of moral sentiments." Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization 77, no. 1 (2011): 53–65.]
