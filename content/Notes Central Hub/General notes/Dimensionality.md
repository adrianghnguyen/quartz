The dimensionality of a dataset is the number of different attributes that it has. A high-dimensionality dataset, then, has many different attributes.^[https://docs.honeycomb.io/concepts/high-cardinality/#:~:text=The%20term%20%E2%80%9Chigh%20cardinality%E2%80%9D%20means,different%20attributes%20attached%20to%20events.]

For example, if we think of the dimensions of cars, there can be SUVs, sedans, vans, etc. Those are dimensions (or attributes) of a car.
