Friendships are incredibly important for our  [[The Happiness Equation|well-being and happiness]]. [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|Increased quality relationships are the key to greater life satisfaction.]]

According to Aristotle, there are three levels of friendship or in other words, three primary functions or core benefits personal relationships:
1. [[Expedient friendships are transactional and utility-based|Utility-based friendship are transactional]]
2. [[Pleasure-based friendship is based on mutual admiration|Pleasure-based friendship is based on mutual admiration]]
3. [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|Atelic friendships which focus on elevating our virtues and mutual admiration]]

It's important to know that these levels might be overlapping and not mutually exclusive. They provide various levels of [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|emotional intimacy]].

## The three levels of friendship according to Aristotle

> - The first and lowest form of friendship is based on utility. Think about the relationships you have with people with whom you work, or with whom you do business. These relationships tend to be transactional in nature. They tend to be based on deals and agreements and rarely drift into sensitive topics like politics, love, or religion.
> - The second and next level of friendship is friendship based on pleasure. This type of relationship is based on mutual admiration because each person draws pleasure from the other. If a person finds their friend funny, interesting, and a source of enjoyment, it is likely a friendship of pleasure.
> - The third level of friendship is what Aristotle considered “perfect.” This type of friendship is based on a bond of virtue and love for an outside source of meaning. Many friendships coalesce around a mutual love for something outside of oneself such as sports, literature, or travel. By Aristotle’s standards, perfect friendships are those between people who have a mutual love for something that not only brings them together, but elevates their behavior to virtue. A relationship is perfect not when it is based on utility or pleasure, but when it is focused on improving the circumstance of the other person.
