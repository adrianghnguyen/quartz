# Apophenia is perceiving meaningful connections where there are none

On the other hand, there exists the concept of apophenia, which is "the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things".

> Apophenia is also typical ofÂ [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory "Conspiracy theory"), where coincidences may be woven together into an apparent plot.^[Bruce Poulsen, "Reality Play: Being Amused by Apophenia", Psychology Today, July 31, 2012. Retrieved 11 August 2020.]

Taken to the extreme, this can be a symptom of paranoid schizophrenia and hostile patterns where they may not be. It's closely related to having delusional thought patterns.

I could see how this could lead to one having a heightened sense of imposter syndrome - because part of my [[Intelligence as a concept|definition of intelligence]] would stem from the ability is to draw connections between unrelated concepts and apply knowledge from a differing field.

I could see how that would also cause a heightened sense of imposter syndrome and the tendency to see hidden patterns where they may not exist.

## Possible explanations of apophenia

- Pattern recognition involves retrieving information from memory and matching it with stimuli.
- There are three ways in which pattern recognition can occur: template matching, prototype matching, and feature analysis.
- Template matching involves comparing stimuli to abstracted templates stored in [[long-term memory]].
- Prototype matching involves recognizing a stimulus as similar to a mental image or average of previous stimuli.
- Feature analysis breaks down the stimulus into its features and processes it through detection, pattern dissection, feature comparison, and recognition.
- Apophenia can occur in pattern recognition when the wrong template is matched, when characteristics of a match are assumed, or when the brain detects patterns that may not exist.
- Evolutionary psychologists suggest that apophenia is a result of years of need and is not a flaw in cognition. This is a field of research called [[Error Management Theory|Error Management Theory]]

## Related terms to apophenia

### Synchronicity

> Synchronicity can be considered synonymous with correlation, without any statement about the veracity of various causal inferences.^[Wikipedia - Apohenia]

### Patternicity

> In 2008, Michael Shermer coined the word "patternicity", defining it as "the tendency to find meaningful patterns in meaningless noise".^[Wikipedia - Apohenia]

### Agenticity

> In The Believing Brain (2011), Shermer wrote that humans have "the tendency to infuse patterns with meaning, intention, and agency", which he called "agenticity".^[Wikipedia - Apohenia]

### Clustering illusion

> A clustering illusion is a type of cognitive bias in which a person sees a pattern in a random sequence of numbers or events. Many theories have been disproved as a result of this bias being highlighted.^[Wikipedia - Apohenia]
