Our modern North American culture has created social world where we [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|cannot connect with others]] leading to an inability to live with [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|full expression]] or inability to be [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|authentic]].

## Sexuality is rife with cultural shame

### Women are sexually shamed

Women are given 3 core messages of cultural shame concerning their sexuality:

| Moral message   | You are evil.      | You are damaged goods and if you like sex you're a slut.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Medical message | You are diseased.  | Sex can cause disease in pregnancy, which makes it dangerous. If a women's [[Dual control model of sexual response|sexual response]] differs from a man, you are diseased - except if you want sex when you're pregnant. Your experience **needs** to follow the precise order of desire, arousal then mutual [[Orgasms are the release of sexual tension|orgasm]]. Anything else and something is wrong with you. |
| Media message   | You are inadequate | You need to be into all the kinks. You need to be a sex goddess but if you don't like sex you're a prude. All the messages are conflicting. Your body is wrong. You're too fat and too thin at the same time. Never just right.                                                                                            |

## Culture shames the expression of emotions

> [!quote] Don't cry - it's uncomfortable for others so just STOP
> And bear in mind that emotion dismissing is often lovingly intended. “Don’t cry, honey,” seems like a thoroughly benevolent sentiment, motivated by a desire to help someone who is suffering to feel better. But underneath “Don’t cry, honey,” is a **subtle hint that the feelings are unwelcome**. That you’re making other people uncomfortable. That it would be easier for everyone if you just didn’t feel that, so please stop.

In most modern culture, including eastern and western, there is a lot of emphasis on emotional dismissal as people are uncomfortable around the expression emotons. I personally believe that it leads people to be less open to emotional vulnerability and can make it harder for us to form [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|strong relationships]].
