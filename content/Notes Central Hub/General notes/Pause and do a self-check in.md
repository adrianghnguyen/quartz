The key is to stop ourselves and see how [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|how we are feeling]] or whenever we may become triggered to have a [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|quick pause to regain mindfulness]]. When we focus on these areas of our basic needs, it can help us determine what's missing in our personal well-being.

> ‚ÄúThere has been an understanding that the disease of addiction is rooted often in having trouble managing [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|underlying negative emotions]],‚Äù says Dr. Stream. ‚ÄúThe biggest threat to a person‚Äôs sobriety and early recovery is ineffective coping strategies to manage those unpleasant emotions or physical states.‚Äù

  - Taking a general multivitamin that tastes good and makes you feel healthy can be beneficial.

Being hungry often leads to cognitive impairment (reduced executive brain function) as we have reduce glucose in our bloodstream which is the primary energy source of the brain.

### Dealing with anger

  - Feeling angry is normal, but chronic anger is unhealthy.
  - Chronic anger can negatively impact decision-making and seep into other areas of life.
  - Letting go of anger and [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|focusing on the present moment]] is important for [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional control]] and cognitive control.
  - Coping strategies for anger include [[Coping mechanisms for stress|stress management]], spirituality, prayer, and meditation.
