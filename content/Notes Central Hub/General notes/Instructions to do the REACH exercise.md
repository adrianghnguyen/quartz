## Example of the REACH method

| Step                                                                                                                        | Example                                                                                                                                                              |

| Recall the hurt (briefly describe what happened)                                                                            | Frodo tells Sam to leave him and chooses Smeagol, abandoning the trust the two had built on their journey through Middle-earth.                                      |
| Empathize with the person who hurt you (write down how you think they might be feeling)                                     | Frodo was deceived by the treachery of the ring. The [[Levels of friendship|bond of friendship]] goes much deeper. Undoubtedly, Frodo feels confused and regretful for his words and actions. |
| Altruistic gift of kindness (envision forgiving without conditions, and brainstorm an action you will take that shows this) | In the midst of it all, I, Sam, found the bread given by the Elves. Whatever is left can be given to Frodo during the ultimate test climbing Mount Doom.             |
| Commit yourself (make a plan to follow through with the other person)                                                       | Tomorrow after sunrise I, Sam, will follow Frodo and deliver the bread.                                                                                              |
| Hold onto forgiveness (think of a way you can follow up and re-affirm your connection with the other person)                   | Every year, I will order bread from the Elves and bring it to Frodoâ€™s house in the Shire showing my commitment to forgiveness and how I truly have no hard feelings. |
