# Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals

#status/done 

Related to [[Module 5 Worldly Rewards]]

There are four primary things which will distract us from the path of true happiness. These four *idols* play a significant influence in [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|decisions about our life]] and our career. When [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|designing our happiest life]], we should avoid being tempted by these four factors:

1. Desire for money and wealth
2. Desire for power
3. Desire of excessive pleasure
4. Desire for fame or recognition

[[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|Pursue intrinsic aspirations over extrinsic goals]]. [[Money can only lower unhappiness|Chasing money can only lower unhappiness]]. [[Seeking additional money has diminishing returns on happiness|Having a higher income has diminishing returns on happiness after a certain threshold.]]

According to the wisdom of philosophers William James and Thomas Aquinas, pursuing the four idols as primary life goals makes true satisfaction impossible and may even bring us harm. It leads us astray from [[Intrinsic happiness is deep contentment and satisfaction which comes from within|achieving true happiness]]. We all come from different backgrounds of privilege which may allow others to access opportunities which we may not have. There is no point in holding feelings of bitter in terms of [[Social comparison|wanting what they have]].

> [!NOTE]- Thomas Aquinas on the Four Idols
> Thomas Aquinas proposed a definitive theory of happiness in Summa Theologiae. He theorized that in our pursuit of happiness, there are four idols that will divert us from the true path to happiness. They are money, power, pleasure, and fame.
>
> According to the philosopher Thomas Aquinas, he believed that "these four things promised happiness but could never deliver it because they never fully satisfy us no matter how much we pursue them. This frustrates us. But the more we become frustrated, the more our will is disordered to strive after money, power, pleasure, and fame. Aquinas believed that these things are idols because they disarm our judgment and beguile our minds."

## Extrinsic aspirations can detract our career path

It may detract us from pursuing the rightful path to an authentic [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]]. It may lead to [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|career journey]] astray.

We may experience a [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|fork in the road]] when we are making decisions about our career. It's important to consider the external societal messages which may be robbing us from the opportunity to [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|design an authentic life]].
