[Our primordial drive for sex and love | Helen Fisher - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzUbAv_Sh0c)

## [0:00:02](https://youtu.be/zzubav_sh0c?t=2s) Introduction to Helen Fisher

Overview: Helen Fisher is an anthropologist who studies the biological origins of love and marriage. She shares her childhood experiences and how they shaped her views on relationships. She also explains her research on the three brain systems that evolved for mating and reproduction.

## The biological origins of love and marriage

* Helen Fisher believes that the patterns of love and marriage have a biological origin.
* She argues that sex drive, romantic love, and feelings of attachment are not phases, but rather brain systems.

### Research on brain systems

* Helen wrote her first academic paper on the three different brain systems that evolved for mating and reproduction: sex drive, romantic love, and feelings of attachment.
* She hypothesized that these systems evolved for various reasons, such as enabling people to focus their mating energy on one partner at a time.
* Her research revealed that intense romantic love is associated with activity in the ventral tegmental area, which produces dopamine and gives people the focus, motivation, craving, and elation associated with love.

Overview: This section discusses the brain activity of people who have been rejected in love and how it is similar to that of people addicted to drugs.

#### Brain regions linked with rejected love

* The ventral tegmental area pumps out dopamine, giving the feeling of intense romantic love.
* Activity was found in a brain region linked with pain.
* Activity was found in three brain regions linked with craving and addiction: the [[Nucleus accumbens]], a brain region linked with the sex drive, and brain regions linked with calm and security.

### Brain regions linked with long-term love

* The ventral tegmental area pumps out dopamine, giving the feeling of intense romantic love.
* Activity was found in a brain region linked with the sex drive.
* Activity was found in brain regions linked with calm and security.
