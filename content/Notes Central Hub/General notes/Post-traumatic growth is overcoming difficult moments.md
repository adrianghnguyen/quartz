# Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments

#status/done

> Posttraumatic growth is the experience of positive change that occurs as a result of the struggle with highly challenging [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|life crises]].

If you’re a [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma survivor]], we need to do a lot of [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional work]] to move through it such as going to therapy. If we never had the chance to process it (trauma was unresolved or is recent), we'll need to work through it which requires time and patience.

Even if the [[Brain-Body Disconnect During Trauma|trauma]] has been processed, there may be lingering effects. [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|Compulsive behaviours]]  can be attempts to undo trauma in a poor manner and devolve into [[Learned helplessness is giving up after repeated failures|learned helplessness]].

We [[View challenges as opportunities|build resilience]] by [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|seeking meaning from hardship]] and applying the [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|Opposite signal strategy is to embrace the uncomfortable]].

## Growth occurs after recovery from trauma

Research shows that [[View challenges as opportunities|we should actually not avoid difficult or negative experiences]] - but it does not mean seeking them out necessarily either. It's called post traumatic [[My core values define what matters|growth]].

It is also suggested that posttraumatic growth mutually interacts with life wisdom and the development of the life narrative, and that it is an ongoing process, not a static outcome.

In the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|Harvard course on happiness]], they tell the story of Beethoven, who started losing his hearing at age 30. After complete loss of hearing, he was able to compose 'Ode to Joy' because he found a way to adapt his changed circumstances and make meaning out of it.

He went from experiencing a terrible bout of [[Depression|depression]] to composing one of his greatest works.
