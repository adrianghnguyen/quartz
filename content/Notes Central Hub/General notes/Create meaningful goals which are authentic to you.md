When we develop positive [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|meta emotions]], our goal stage change - leading to a reducing between a gap of our present state and our goal state - similar to reducing the gap between [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego and superego]]. When we minimize this, we move closer to becoming our [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|realized selves]]. It comes from understanding how our personal [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values and how they guide our behaviors]].

[[Vision as deep personal expression|Tap into your full expression to develop clear vision as said by timothy butler]]

It's also okay to [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|re-evaluate goals if they no longer fit into our original vision]]. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is always fluctuating and unpredictable.]]

## Goals are sometimes not our own but rather forced through external messages

As a result of our [[Personality is shaped our environment|upbringing]] and [[Cultural roots of shame|culture]]. Goals may sometimes be implanted into her minds rather than being meaningfully chosen through [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|deliberate thought]].

The scripts are what's been automatically programmed in us is not what we necessarily believe to be [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|true]]. "They act as a template for our emotional One Ring and for our [[Little monitors seek to resolve worldly discrepancies|little monitor]] to filter and [[Brains organize information into schemas|organize information]]."^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]
