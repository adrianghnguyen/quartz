[[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|Mindfulness]] is about being non judgmental about whatever is happening in the present moment. It is not the awareness of the internal state that matters as it does not predict wellbeing.^[Baer, “Construct Validity of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire.”] What matters most for well-being in terms of [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|meta-emotion]] is feeling "nonjudge" aka feeling neutral towards our [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|feelings]].

| Judgemental Attitude  | - "I tell myself that I shouldn't be thinking the way I'm thinking." <br> - "When I have distressing thoughts or images, I judge myself as good or bad, depending on what the thought/image is about."                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Non-judgemental Attitude | - When something is happening, individuals simply recognize it without passing judgment on their ego. <br> - They acknowledge feelings without labeling them as good or bad, focusing on neutrality. They accept their emotions, whether they make sense or not, whether they're comfortable or not, and regardless of whether they align with their beliefs about what they should be feeling. |

Practicing this can can also help us heal from [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional pain]].

## Feel your feels - don't dismiss them

“If there is no solution to an uncomfortable feeling, there’s no point feeling it.” is a common [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|emotion dismissing]] attitude. The purpose of feeling something is to let it discharge and [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|complete the stress response cycle]].

It can be helpful to have a compassionate attitude towards this kind of uncomfortable experience. It's important to [[Forgive yourself for past traumas|forgive yourself for past traumas]]. It can be easy to [[Emotional suppression and denial|dismiss or minimize]] our feelings towards our [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional pain]]. But running away from them may just have a cost which we can only delay.

> This is not the habit most of us learn early in our lives, and it takes practice. When we have feelings we can’t really do anything about and we don’t know how to let ourselves simply feel without doing anything, our brains will look for some situation it can do something about, and it will try to impose the feelings on that situation.
>
> So don’t be mad at the guy who’s long gone. Just allow the anger to move through you. It doesn’t matter what it’s about, it’s just random Feels, left over from the past, that have to work themselves out. Don’t hit the gas pedal, but don’t hit the brake either. Notice the anger and allow it. Be still, and it will blow through you like a hot desert wind or a typhoon.

### Practice non-judgement by engaging with the uncomfortable emotions

> Remember that feelings are biological cycles with a beginning, a middle, and an end, built in. You believed me when I said it earlier, right? [[Invisible lions of stress|When we got chased by a lion]]? And the kid came out from under anesthesia?
>
> Feeling an emotion won’t get you trapped forever in that emotion; on the contrary, it will allow you to move through it, like a tunnel. It might not be fun, but it’s not dangerous. Your body knows how to do it. All you have to do is allow it.
>
> Some people find it helpful to think about allowing feelings in the same way they allow themselves to pee and poop. It’s built into the system. You don’t tell yourself you shouldn’t have to pee, you just wait for an appropriate time and place. And if your need to pee is urgent, you seek out an appropriate context. Same goes for feelings. They’re a natural part of [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|being human]], built into our biology. Cultural rules mean we can’t just feel our feeling anywhere we want, but we can find an appropriate time and place.

> The [[Flock of birds metaphor|flock of birds metaphor for self-organization]] from chapter 8: Nonjudging is allowing the birds in the flock to fly away from a predator. Sometimes people are afraid that if they let those birds fly away, they’ll fly away from the predator forever. But that’s not how the system works.
>
> Once the birds have escaped from the predator (or noticed spontaneously that there is no predator after all), they’ll transition back to flying toward the magnetic pole along with their neighbors. But if you don’t allow them to fly away—if you say to yourself, “I shouldn’t have that feeling,” and slam on the brake—that’s like trying to cage the birds who are trying to escape.
>
> **And how will those birds react? They’ll freak out, batter themselves against the bars, desperate to escape both the predator and the cage. Allow them to escape and trust that they’ll rejoin the flock.**
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

If I understand the fact that uncomfortable experiences of emotions are like tunnels, then even moments of hopelessness and suffering will terminate. I'll need to remind myself of this in the case of [[Learned optimism is a skill|learned optimism]].

So I should really embrace my emotional side - perhaps I am not insane after all to feel so sad over such complex grief over the loss of [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]] over the years. That I feel too much. That my feelings will be a burden for others. It's okay.

## Non-judgement in regards to sexuality

> Now suppose that instead of putting it in a box, you’re aware of your feeling about your sexuality and are curious about it, or you’re gently affectionate toward it, as you would be toward a tearful newborn or a sad, shy kitten, or you’re simply neutrally observing from the sidelines of your own internal experience. These kinds of compassionate self-awareness create a context that doesn’t hit the brakes and instead allows your internal state to complete its cycle.^[Ibid.; Van Dam, Earleywine, and Danoff-Burg, “Differential Item Function”; Baer et al., “Using Self-Report Assessment Methods”; Silverstein et al., “Effects of Mindfulness Training.” (This last paper concludes, unaccountably, that interoception—awareness of one’s body—is what made the difference, even though the “observe” factor did not change significantly and the “nonjudge” factor changed the most significantly.), as said by [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]
