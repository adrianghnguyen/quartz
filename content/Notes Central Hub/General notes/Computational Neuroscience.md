## What is computational neuroscience

It's a multidisciplinary field trying to understand the brain with an emphasis on using **mathematical models**, computers and statistics rather than purely approaching from a neurobiology perspective and its related brain experimental data. The two fields are interlinked which one focuses more on physical experiments while the other relies on computations (hence the name) and mathematics.

### Explained in more details

> Computational neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the brain and nervous system by using mathematical models, computer simulations, and statistical analyses. It combines elements of neuroscience, psychology, [[Map of Content/Computer Science|computer science]], mathematics, and physics to study how the [[information processing theory|brain processes information]], makes decisions, and controls behavior.
>
> Computational neuroscientists aim to explain how the brain functions at different levels of organization, from individual neurons and synapses to large-scale brain networks. They develop and test theoretical models of neural systems and use these models to make predictions about neural activity and behavior.
>
> Computational neuroscience has a wide range of applications, including:
>  - the development of [[Artificial intelligence]] and robotics
>  - the design of new treatments for neurological disorders
>  - the understanding of [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]] such as perception, [[Memory is processed information|memory]], and attention.^[ChatGPT]

## Difference between computational neuroscience and traditional neuroscience

Traditional neuroscience is one of the data inputs through biology/brain scan **experiments** which inform scientists working within the computational neuroscience field how to build their **mathematical models**.

> In summary, traditional neuroscience and computational neuroscience are **complementary approaches** to studying the brain and nervous system. While traditional neuroscience provides the experimental data that informs computational models, computational neuroscience provides a framework for understanding the principles that underlie neural processing and behavior.
>
> Traditional neuroscience is primarily focused on studying the structure and function of the brain and nervous system using experimental methods such as brain imaging, electrophysiology, and histology. These methods are used to investigate the properties of individual neurons and the way they interact to produce behavior.
>
> Computational neuroscience, on the other hand, seeks to explain these phenomena using mathematical models and computer simulations. Rather than relying solely on experimental data, computational neuroscience uses these models to make predictions about neural activity and behavior, which can be tested experimentally.
>
> Another way in which computational neuroscience differs from traditional neuroscience is in its focus on the underlying mechanisms of neural processing. While traditional neuroscience aims to describe the functional properties of neurons and neural circuits, computational neuroscience seeks to understand the computational principles that underlie these properties.
