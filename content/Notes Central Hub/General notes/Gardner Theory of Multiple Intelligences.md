## Explaining of Gardner theory of multiple intelligences

> The theory claims that human beings have *different ways in which they process data*, each being **independent processes**.
>
> The eight types of intelligence described by Gardner include: musical-rhythmic, visual-spatial, verbal-linguistic, logical-mathematical, bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal and naturalistic.

It's the leading theory to explain how [[Intelligence as a concept]] works within high intellectual potential ([[High intellectual potential overview]]).

### Supporting evidence for gardner's theory of multiple intelligence

> [!NOTE] Current leading theory of intelligence
> 318 MRI brain imaging studies have found that our brains possess distinct neuronal networks for each specific kind of intelligence.^[Shearer, C. B., & Karanian, J. M. (2017). The neuroscience of intelligence: Empirical support for the theory of multiple intelligences?. _Trends in neuroscience and education_, _6_, 211-223. Chicago]

> It's the best empirical theory of the moment explaining how intelligence works.

## Types of intelligence according to Gardner

Type | Definition | Real-world context
--|--|--
musical-rhythmic |  good thinking in rhythms, sounds, or patterns |  person with higher musical-rhythmic intelligence can be a good musician, conductor, composer, singer, etc.
visual-spatial | visualize objects better, such as images, illustrations, maps, charts, videos, and the like. |  architect, photographer, interior designer, etc.
verbal-linguistic | master the use of words, both verbally and in written form | teachers, writers, public speakers, newscasters, and actors
logical-mathematical | good at logical and mathematical skills - able to quickly solve problems | mathematicians and accountants
bodily-kinesthetic | good hand-eye coordination and agility | farmer, mechanic, dancer, athletes
interpersonal | better evaluate other people’s emotions, moods, desires, and motivations | Mental health counselors, salesperson, customer service, public facing positions
intrapersonal | High ability for **[[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] ([[Journaling is healthy]])** - [[Identify the emotion you are feeling|emotions]], motivations, and relationship with others | Author, philosopher, entrepreneur|
naturalistic | understanding of nature | Biologists, gardeners, farmers, animal trainers, and geologists

### Gardner intelligences undergoing validation

Type | Definition
--|--
Existential | Asking questions about philosophy, the nature of things, existence, ethics, etc.
Pedagogical | Teaching - Ability to transmit knowledge to others in an efficient manner

## Application of Gardner theory of multiple intelligences in business and leadership

### Intelligence applied in business environments

> Companies that have made good use of their employees’ capabilities have been one of the biggest innovators in recent years.
>
> Google has a 20% policy by which it allows its employees to use 20% of their paid time for personal projects. This has led to many successful projects resulting in the world’s top services such as Gmail, [Google AdSense](https://flippa.com/blog/guide-to-google-adsense/), and Google News.
>
> Similarly, the Adobe Kickstart initiative allows employees to get a $1,000 credit card to build prototypes which are then pitched to executives. Even if a single executive gives the green signal, the prototype moves to the next level of testing and [funding](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/five-examples-of-companie_b_7023322).^[https://slidemodel.com/gardners-theory-8-multiple-intelligences/#:~:text=The%20theory%20claims%20that%20human,%2C%20interpersonal%2C%20intrapersonal%20and%20naturalistic.]

### Relationship between intelligence and leadership

> The world’s most successful entrepreneurs did not reach their prestigious positions by accident. We can argue that Steve Jobs had high visual-spatial intelligence that allowed him to revolutionize the world of computing. Steve Jobs also believed in empowering employees; he thought it was no use to hire smart people to give them strict instructions.
>
> Instead, he believed that hiring talented individuals entailed allowing them to tell the company what to do. He once said, “It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do”.
>
> Leaders can use Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences to allocate tasks, encourage their team members to focus on what they are best at and promote their creativity. Leaders that can rise above their insecurities are true leaders, who can uplift a team to perform at its best.

## Thoughts and reflections on the nature of multiple intelligence

Can these be improved through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|dedicated practice]]? Apparently there's an upper ceiling where [[Talent is dedication by few|talent takes over]]. 

I honestly think I score pretty highly on some of these:

- verbal-linguistic - here I am writing
- logical-mathematical - always been good at math
- bodily-kinesthetic - when I apply myself…I got pretty good at biking and I'm pretty adept at fixing stuff. I think I can become good at dancing as well with my kpop dance practice? I have some catch up to do as I only started doing it more recently.
- Interpersonal and intrapersonal are highly intertwined - but what if it's due to part of my introverted nature as well as time spent [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] and therapy?

It'd be nice to keep working on the other aspects. I do some gardening during summer but I don't really know the science behind taking care of plants. I'm learning to become better at music and singing ([[Mechanics of singing]]) which will help out with my kpop dancing.
