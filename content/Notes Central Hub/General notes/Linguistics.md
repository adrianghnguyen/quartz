## What is linguistics?

Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure, including syntax, morphology, phonetics, and semantics. It also encompasses the study of language acquisition, its history, and variation across different cultures and regions.

Linguistics can provide insights into the complexity and diversity of human language that are essential for understanding ourselves and others.

Linguists, those who are scientists within the field use a variety of methods to analyze language, such as statistical analysis, fieldwork, experimental studies, and computer modeling.

## Starting points to learn linguistics

Linguistics is a branch of cognitive science that studies language, its structure, acquisition, and use. To begin understanding linguistics and its role in cognitive science, here are some starting points:

Introduction to Linguistics: A good starting point is to familiarize yourself with the basic concepts of linguistics. You can start by reading an introductory book on linguistics, such as "Linguistics: An Introduction" by Andrew Radford, Martin Atkinson, David Britain, Harald Clahsen.

Syntax and Semantics: Understanding syntax and semantics is crucial to understanding how language works. Syntax refers to the structure of sentences, while semantics is concerned with meaning. You can start by studying basic sentence structures and the relationships between words.

Psycholinguistics: Psycholinguistics is the study of how the brain processes language. It involves examining the [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]] that underlie language production and comprehension. You can start by reading introductory books on psycholinguistics, such as "Psycholinguistics: Introduction and Applications" by Traxler and Gernsbacher.

Neurolinguistics: Neurolinguistics is the study of how the brain processes language at the neurological level. It involves examining the brain structures and functions that are involved in language processing. You can start by reading introductory books on neurolinguistics, such as "The Neurolinguistics of Bilingualism" by Jubin Abutalebi.

Computational Linguistics: Computational Linguistics is a field that combines linguistics and computer science to develop algorithms and models that can process and analyze language. You can start by reading introductory books on computational linguistics, such as "Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing" by Christopher Manning and Hinrich Sch√ºtze.
