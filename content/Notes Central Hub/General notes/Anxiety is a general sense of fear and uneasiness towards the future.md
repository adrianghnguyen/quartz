> Anxiety is a normal emotion experienced by everyone at some point in their lives. It is a feeling of unease, worry, or fear about something that may or may not happen in the future. While occasional anxiety is common and can even be helpful in certain situations, excessive or chronic anxiety can interfere with daily life and well-being. Symptoms of anxiety may include restlessness, irritability, difficulty concentrating, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances.

> The text explores the concept of brain plasticity, the brain's remarkable ability to modify its connections in response to external stimuli. It stresses that anxiety, a common human emotion often triggered by fear or worry in uncertain situations, can be utilized beneficially. With appropriate psychological tools and neuroscience, anxiety can be transformed into a source of "gifts" or "superpowers", by changing our perception of it.

> The three major "superpowers" mentioned include:
>
> 1. Productivity: Anxious 'what if?' thoughts can be transformed into actionable tasks on a to-do list, harnessing anxious energy into something productive.
> 2. Flow: Despite anxiety often interfering with flow, the state of being completely absorbed in a task, mini episodes of 'micro flow' can still occur and be enhanced by our personal anxieties.
> 3. Empathy: By understanding our own forms of anxiety, we can recognize and empathize with the same in others, influencing more kindness and connection.
>
> The 'negativity bias' and the lack of 'cognitive flexibility' contribute to excessive anxiety. However, an 'activist mindset', which involves cognitive flexibility and the ability to see various possibilities in a situation, can be a powerful tool to adjust perception of anxiety.
>
> The author also correlates the journey of dealing with personal loss, by using an 'activist mindset', to managing anxiety. Emphasizing the importance of changing perspective to transform difficulties into opportunities for growth and self-discovery.
