# Healthy skepticism is keeping the door open to new evidence

#status/done

I think a good part of good skepticism is learning to [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|withhold judgment and reactions]] when faced with new information rather than outright dismissal. It's a core facet of a [[Nonjudgmental attitude is the ability to withhold judgment and biases|nonjudgmental attitude]] and the [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|mark of an educated mind]].

Most of the time, I [[Curiosity as my worldview|enjoy learning]] for the sake of it rather than from the approach of an academic writer or researcher.

It's not a matter of life and death, and I don't think that being incorrect would be the end of the world. We should be careful to manage our expectations of [[Seek truth over accuracy|accuracy over validity]]. I feel confident my knowledge due to [[Knowledge convergence|knowledge convergence]] leads me to be strong in my [[Bayesian Decision Theory|beliefs]]. I think most of the time, it is better to be [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|cognitively flexible]] and integrate new information into our worldview, as part of an [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|accelerated learning philosophy]].

With that being said, I do value the opinions of others and seek to understand where they come from. But broken records - repetitive answers which do not seek to provide [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|insightful questions]] are not useful to me.

## Being close-minded differs from skepticism

Close-mindedness refers to the unwillingness or inability to consider or accept new ideas, beliefs, or opinions that differ from one's own aka your personal views. We need to practice [[Practice epistemic humility to recognize the limitations of your knowledge and understanding|epistemic humility to understand that perhaps our personal views and held beliefs may not be correct.]] It means having a rigid and fixed mindset which resists to change towards [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|alternative perspectives]].

On the other hand, we may have personal core values which set up the foundation of our [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]]. It helps us navigate the world in an authentic manner as [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values guide our behaviour like a lighthouse]].

[[Avoid cognitive rigidity|A rigid mindset is inflexible and refuses to consider alternative perspectives about the world.]] We should learn to constantly question underlying assumptions.

> Close-mindedness refers to the unwillingness or inability to consider or accept new ideas, beliefs, or opinions that differ from one's own. It is characterized by a rigid and fixed mindset that resists change and is often accompanied by a lack of empathy or understanding towards alternative perspectives. Close-minded individuals tend to dismiss or reject information that challenges their existing beliefs, resulting in a limited and narrow worldview. Overcoming close-mindedness involves actively seeking out diverse perspectives, being open to new ideas, and cultivating empathy and understanding towards others.

-   A close-minded person might reject a new idea or claim without considering any evidence, simply because it contradicts their existing beliefs or worldview. This would also apply to the way at how they evaluate their evidence.
-   A skeptical person, on the other hand, would carefully evaluate the evidence for the new idea or claim, and withhold belief until there is sufficient evidence to support it.
-   A close-minded person might dismiss alternative viewpoints or perspectives without considering their merits, simply because they are unfamiliar or uncomfortable.
-   A skeptical person, in contrast, would be willing to consider alternative viewpoints, and evaluate them based on their evidence and logic.
