## What are the Noble Eightfold Paths?

The eight Buddhist practices in the Noble Eightfold Path are:

| Noble Eightfold Path Practices | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Right View | Our actions have consequences, death is not the end, and our actions and beliefs have consequences after death. The Buddha followed and taught a successful path out of this world and the other world (heaven and underworld/hell). Later on, right view came to explicitly include karma and rebirth, and the importance of the Four Noble Truths, when "insight" became central to Buddhist soteriology, especially in Theravada Buddhism. |
| Right Resolve or Intention | The giving up of home and adopting the life of a religious mendicant in order to follow the path; this concept aims at peaceful renunciation, into an environment of non-sensuality, non-ill-will (to loving kindness), away from cruelty (to compassion). Such an environment aids contemplation of [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature]], suffering, and non-Self. |
| Right Speech | No lying, no rude speech, no telling one person what another says about him to cause discord or harm their relationship, no idle chatter. |
| Right Conduct or Action | No killing or injuring, no taking what is not given, no sexual misconduct, no material desires. |
| Right Livelihood | No trading in weapons, living beings, meat, liquor, and poisons. |
| Right Effort | Preventing the arising of unwholesome states, and generating wholesome states, the bojjhagā (Seven Factors of Awakening). This includes indriya-samvara, "guarding the sense-doors", restraint of the sense faculties. |
| Right Mindfulness (sati; Satipatthana; Sampajañña) | A quality that guards or watches over the mind; the stronger it becomes, the weaker unwholesome states of mind become, weakening their power "to take over and dominate thought, word and deed." In the vipassana movement, sati is interpreted as "bare attention": never be absent minded, being conscious of what one is doing; this encourages the awareness of the [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature]] of body, feeling and mind, as well as to experience the five aggregates (skandhas), the five hindrances, the four True Realities and seven factors of awakening. |
| Right samadhi (passaddhi; ekaggata; sampasadana) | Practicing four stages of dhyāna ("meditation"), which includes samadhi proper in the second stage, and reinforces the development of the bojjhagā, culminating into upekkha (equanimity) and mindfulness. In the Theravada tradition and the vipassana movement, this is interpreted as ekaggata, concentration or one-pointedness of the mind, and supplemented with vipassana meditation, which aims at insight. |

It's under consideration at the moment since I am reading the book [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula]]. Buddha preached these are the ways one can [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberately practice]] living a good life.

## Avoiding ill words through right speech

Right speech implies that one should avoid idle chatter - avoiding gossip of others and speaking poorly. I believe that if one has to say something about another - it should be done so directly, through the practice of [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]] or be abstained. Practice deep [[Writing is the medium by which we think|introspection]] and exercise [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|critical thinking]] to determine if we are acting out of guttural reactions and what should be done accordingly.

If we connect it to [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|cognitive behavioral therapy]], engaging in [[Neuroplasticity|habits]] would cause one to reinforce certain patterns of [[Stages involved in behavioral change|behavior]] including [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|negative ones]]. Gossip much and you will become that much more proficient at it. It may be worth practicing diligence and self-monitoring to ensure that such behaviours are nipped in the bud.

I feel like this is something worth practicing and worth unlearning from my environment. Avoid [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict people]] and people of low values in order to stay along this path. Similarly, choose to surround yourself with people whom you look up to and aspire to be.
