# Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention

[[Getting unstuck -  How Dead Ends Become New Paths by Timothy Butler|Getting Unstuck - How Dead Ends Become New Paths by Timothy Butler]] introduces the concept of free attention which is a subset of [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] practices. IT is a technique we can use to deal [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological impasse]].

Our minds are surprisingly adept at drawing connections as it has a natural tendency to [[Brains organize information into schemas|organize information]]. 

However, we can learn to let the [[Dealing with our inner critic|voice of the accuser]] go by with [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|the practice of mindfulness]] and develop a [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|nonjudgmental attitude]].

> The text discusses the concept of free attention and its importance in engaging open concentration. Free attention is described as a state of alert presence, free from distraction and attachment to emerging images. It is contrasted with the ego, which categorizes and labels experiences to maintain familiarity and react efficiently. The ego resists free attention as it fears facing threatening situations or being unable to tap into underlying instincts. However, free attention allows us to gather new information and insights by suspending judgments and looking deeply. It is an art of being fully present and requires deliberate practice.

> A first step is to practice “free attention.” Some mastery of this practice is necessary in order to take full advantage of the exercises that follow later, to engage an open concentration that is alert and yet not attached to the images that will emerge. Free attention is a freedom from distraction, an alert presence that requires an intensity of focus akin to that of a climber walking the knife edge of a mountain wall. It requires everything we can bring to it.
>
> When practicing free attention, we are working against the powerful conditioning of our egos. ***By ego I mean that part of the self that wants to keep everything familiar by labeling and categorizing. Ego places new experiences that might pose a threat to the status quo into old boxes so we can judge them and react to them efficiently.*** Every day we wake up to this whirring and buzzing world and our ego starts to sort things out, making them seem familiar. Disruptions to this status quo are inherently threatening; if allowed to become conscious, they may evoke anxiety. It is ego’s job to keep that fear, and what lies beneath it, at bay.

> So in the face of a new day of experience, ego begins to make plans: we make decisions about how we are feeling, what clothes to put on, what to eat for breakfast, when we need to leave the house to get to work. We choose to seek out some people and avoid others. We listen to the news and form opinions so we have some sense of order and mastery over the information that continues to barrage us as the day progresses. Ego allows us to feel more safe and to be decisive, but at a cost. We may suppress new information that is at odds with the status quo. Ego interprets the world using shorthand, and in doing so it may miss important information.

> Ego is likely to resist the practice of free attention. It does not want us to face the fear that whatever will come up will in some way be threatening, that we will not be able to “do it,” that we will not be able to tap the energy and act on the instinct just beneath the surface.

> However, when we are at an impasse, we need [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|new information]], especially information about what is missing rather than a summary of what is already there. The practice of free attention allows us to take in this new information. It does not eliminate ego, but rather suspends the judgments that prevent us from seeing and intuiting more deeply. It is this quality of alert, intense, and non-judgmental looking that Marcy Kaufman brought to the image of the red van and that Rilke brought to Apollo’s torso.

> Practicing free attention is the art of being more fully present. It is much more than just relaxing. It is simple, but not easy. That is why it is a [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|practice]]. For starters, the practice involves setting aside ten or fifteen minutes any time we feel the need to “step back” and, at least temporarily, suspend the noise and the narrowness of our current [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]].
