## What is a sense of belonging?

The need to belong, also known as **belongingness**, refers to a human's emotional need to affiliate with and be accepted by members of a group. This may include the need to belong to a peer group at school, to be accepted by co-workers, to be part of an athletic team, or to be part of a religious group.

A sense of belonging involves more than simply being acquainted with other people. It is centered on *gaining acceptance, attention, and support from members of the group* as well as providing the [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|same attention]] to other members through [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|empathetic responses]]. The need to belong to a group also can lead to changes in behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes as people strive to conform to the standards and norms of the group aka the *need to conform*.

In *social psychology*, the need to belong is an [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] to affiliate with others and be socially accepted. This need plays a role in a number of social phenomena such as self-presentation and social comparison.^[https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-need-to-belong-2795393]

### Where does the need to belong come from?

#### Socially - we are born with a sense of attachment

We begin life with the most crucial of needs — attachment to a caregiver. This is the beginning of our fundamental need for belonging. Studies have shown that children who have not achieved a [[Secure attachment style have a foundation of positive beliefs in relationships|healthy attachment]] in their young life have lower self-esteem, a more negative worldview, are mistrustful and can have a increased [[Fear of rejection|perception of rejection]].

Having a sense of belonging is so important, considering the groups and labels we give ourselves and others. We are members of families, sporting teams, hobbyists, spiritual groups, charities, political parties, cities, countries and nationalities, to name a few. Nearly every aspect of our lives is organized around belonging to something.

The sense of belonging is fundamental to the way humankind organizes itself. If it was unimportant, we would live solitary lives only coming together for procreation then quickly kicking the children out of our lives as soon as they could walk. We would have no families, communities or organized government. [^1]

#### Feeling like you don't belong comes from a sense of unworthiness

It may happen as part of one's early life experiences such as the [[The trauma of abandonment|trauma of abandonment]] leading to a deep sense of rejection of the self, otherwise seen as a [[Shame and guilt are inherited|sense of unworthiness]].

## Sense of belonging leads to life satisfaction and general happiness

A sense of belonging is **crucial to our life satisfaction, happiness, mental health and physical health and even longevity**. It gives us a sense of purpose and meaning. Research has shown that loss of belonging has been associated with stress, illness and decreased wellbeing and [[Depression|depression]].

We cannot separate the importance of a sense of belonging from our physical and mental health.

The social ties that accompany a sense of belonging are a protective factor helping us manage stress and other behavioral issues. When we feel we have support and are [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|not alone]], we are more resilient, often coping more effectively with difficult times in our lives. Coping well with hardships decreases the physical and mental effects of these situations.

[[Depression|Depression]], [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] and suicide are common mental health conditions associated with lacking a sense of belonging. These conditions can lead to social behaviors that interfere with a person’s ability to connect to others, creating a cycle of events that further weakens a sense of belonging.

## How to increase your sense of belonging

### Challenge your core beliefs

> According to Talkspace therapist Joanna Filidor, LMFT, **people who struggle with a poor sense of belonging have likely struggled with it for most of their life. For example, if you grew up feeling different, you might hold a core belief of “I do not belong.”**
>
> These types of core beliefs become sticky and begin to shape how you view the world. “As you begin to go through life,” explained Filidor, “your brain only pays attention to the evidence that will support the core beliefs *‘I do not belong’* so even if the overall experience is one where you do belong, you might give more weight to the one interaction with a coworker where you didn’t belong.”

It's important to challenge and evolve our core beliefs and develop the capacity for [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|self-love]]. We can become [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|shame resilient]].

### Practice unconditional self-acceptance

> In her book [[Braving the Wilderness by Brené Brown|“Braving the Wilderness: The Quest for True Belonging and the Courage to Stand Alone,”]] Brené Brown says, *“I don’t think there’s anything lonelier than being with people and feeling alone.”* I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been surrounded by people and felt completely alone. It’s hands-down one of the worst feelings. Because the logical part of you is screaming *“How could you possibly feel alone right now? There are so many people to talk to!” by your heart is saying, “But I don’t want to talk to anyone. No one understands me here.”*
>
> I’ve found that a **lot of my feelings of [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|loneliness]]** stem from a **deeper well of unworthiness**. That people don’t understand me, don’t get me, don’t see me, and don’t appreciate me. One of the only ways I’ve been able to pull myself out of the [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|painful feelings]] of not belonging is to practice self-love and unconditional [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-acceptance]]. Filidor reiterates that experiences like trauma, dysfunctional childhood, and unhealthy relationships can lead to a feeling of not belonging.
>
> “These experiences cause a person to chronically experience a lack of unconditional self-acceptance,” shared Filidor, “leading them to rely on external forces for validation.” If you can feel worthy all on your own, then the feeling of not belonging won’t sting as much. ^[2]

### Other mindful practices

#### Make an effort to engage with others

The most crucial ingredient to building a sense of belonging is effort. You cannot belong if you don't choose to make the effort to engage with others. It may feel uncomfortable at first to meet new people, but give it time, as you may need to practice self-talk. Soon the actions will become second nature. Behavioral activation and opposite action are effective strategies for getting yourself to put in the effort. Action often is needed to feel motivated.

#### Be mindful of others

Think less about yourself while with others and *make the other person or the group your focus*. Making conversation is critical to increasing your sense of belonging. It is important to *mutually ask questions*, make small talk, self-disclose skillfully and listen to people's responses.

#### Keep and teach an open mind

*Try new activities and meet new people. Consider new ways of thinking.*

Lead by example so your children can see how it works. Put in effort to seek activities and groups of people who you share common interests with. You may need to make it happen to start. Encourage and support your children to get involved.

#### Practice an attitude of acceptance

[[Be a kinder person by not blaming others#Accept that others are allowed to have different opinions|Recognize that others have different ways of being]], which don't have to change you. Focus on similarities rather than differences. Similarities tend to increase bonding. If you feel that people are not like you, focus on a mutual goal, such as a volunteer opportunity. Teach children to *validate the feelings of others*.

Acceptance is a form of [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity]].
