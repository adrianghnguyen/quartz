## Understanding the difference between guilt and shame

> [!NOTE] Brené Brown differentiates shame from [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]]
> -   [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|Shame]]: "I am bad."
> -   [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|Guilt]]: "I did something bad."

[[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|Shame is focused on our perception of ourselves as a person]], while [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]] is focused on the evaluation of our actions. Shame can be particularly harmful, as it often leads to self-blame, self-judgment, and a sense of unworthiness.

Shame and guilt are two distinct negative emotions that play a significant role in our lives. While shame can be destructive and hinder our growth, [[Use powerful emotions towards constructive ends|guilt can be a constructive force]] that helps us learn from our mistakes and improve our relationships with others.
