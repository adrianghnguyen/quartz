## The field of cognitive engineering

Cognitive engineering is a growing field with many opportunities for professionals with a background in cognitive science and engineering.

### Future industry opportunities of cognitive engineering seems bright

Cognitive engineering is a growing field with increasing demand for professionals who can apply cognitive science principles to engineering and design. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment in the computer and information technology field, which includes cognitive engineering roles, is projected to grow 11% from 2019 to 2029, which is much faster than the average for all occupations. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for new and improved technologies and the need to optimize these technologies for human use.

## Educational background of cognitive engineers

Cognitive engineers typically have a strong educational background in both cognitive science and engineering. Overall, cognitive engineers have a **diverse educational background** that includes both cognitive science and engineering. This multidisciplinary approach prepares them to **design and develop systems and products** that are optimized for human use (similar to human-centered design).

Education in cognitive science usually includes coursework in psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. Courses in cognitive science provide an understanding of how the human brain processes information, how humans learn and remember, and how language and communication function.

To become a cognitive engineer, a Bachelor's degree in cognitive science, engineering, or a related field is typically required. However, many cognitive engineers pursue advanced degrees, such as a Master's or Ph.D., to deepen their knowledge and expertise in both fields.

Cognitive engineering programs are also becoming more common at universities, providing a multidisciplinary approach to the field. These programs offer courses that combine cognitive science and engineering, providing students with a broad understanding of how to design and optimize systems and technologies for human use.
