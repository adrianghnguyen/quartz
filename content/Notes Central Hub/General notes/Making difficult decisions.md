## Making difficult personal decisions in a nutshell

[[Making decisions for the future can be challenging|Making decisions for the future can be challenging]].

1. Think of the decision
2. Draw up 2-3 alternatives and accept the fact that each have a certain opportunity cost
3. Visualize going through a decision and practice [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|free attention]] to note your feelings on the matter. Write notes as needed.
4. Try getting your mental headspace into a decision at the opposite spectrum
5. Test a preliminary decision while gathering information

It can be challenging to make good plans as the circumstances are ever-changing. There's a military saying which goes along the lines of "No plan survives first contact". Learn to remain [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|flexible]] and adapt accordingly.

### Bring your complete self into the decision making space

Often, making difficult decisions will involve you making tradeoffs, because you're being pulled in different directions. As a result, one should consider where their [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|value lie]] as we tend to sacrifice our integrity through priority. It can often be difficult to [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|live authentically]].

#### Passage from getting unstuck

> Bring to mind a difficult decision you face. Allow yourself to become aware of two or three competing alternatives. Each of your alternatives will seem less than fully satisfying, as each will mean forgoing an alternative opportunity. Every decision entails loss.
>
> Practicing [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|free attention]], spend some time at each of the poles of the decision tension in turn. Focus on that alternative and become aware of the images, associations, and [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|feelings]] that come to you as you consider selecting that option. Be aware of what you will give up by doing so. Now imagine that you have made your decision and will go in that direction. What enters your imagination? What will the consequences be? Let yourself feel the emotional uneasiness that inevitably will arise; let yourself experience “buyer’s remorse” or “decider’s remorse” fully. Do not try to rationalize or justify it. Simply feel it.
>
> You may want to jot down a few words or phrases to remind you of your experience at that pole. Stay with those images and feelings only for a few minutes, and then move on to the pole of the next alternative. With your free attention, watch what happens when you make the decision to go with the alternative that pole offers. Repeat the process for each alternative and allow yourself to experience intuitively, analytically, and emotionally what it would be like to make the decision for each.
>
> It is often helpful to take preliminary “as if” action steps before making a final choice. We all so frequently allow dynamic tensions to become abstractions that reside only in our heads, bouncing off old preconceived notions; instead we should let our full selves experience the reality of the options. We should all, when locked into the discomfort of the dynamic tension beneath an important choice, take action at each of the poles.
>
> The process of working with the poles of the dynamic tension is the same if we are facing a broader life decision and not a career decision.
>
> We must spend time at each of the poles and observe the feelings, thoughts, and images that come to us while we focus with our free attention. We must see what happens when we make an “as if” decision that favors whether we move to a new city or not, embark on one new project rather than another, or whatever it might be.
>
> Once we have done the work of amplifying our true reactions to each pole, we need to test a preliminary decision by *getting new information*.
>
> We need to spend a month in the city we might move to or gather information about the project we are considering as if we have committed to it. We must get the decision out of our head. We need to jump in the pool and get wet. The only way forward is to bring our whole person into the tension of the choice. (See “Deep Dive: Working with the Poles of Decision.”)
>
> The terrain when experiencing the tensions of a difficult choice is to seek a quick compromise. This rarely works and rarely satisfies.

## Non-choice is a choice in itself

Oftentimes we will sit by the sidelines while we try and gather information. Perhaps we feel inconfident, or we have certain anxieties. It's important to realize that not making decision is also a decision in itself. There is a time value cost of opportunity.
