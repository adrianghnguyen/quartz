# Dynamic systems theory

#status/done

Dynamic systems theory (SDT) is a successor theory to [[Difference between control systems theory and dynamic systems theory|control systems theory]] as well as the [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|TOTE problem-solving model]] which explains why things behave a certain way by emphasizing that a system is not on rails, using fixed rules or [[Feedback loop|feedback loops]]  but is actually the resulting outcome of multiple factors interacting and constantly evolving.

This theory also argues that these things (factors such as [[Personality is shaped our environment|environment]], individual motivations, [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive process]], etc.) are a result of things interacting with from fundamental processes (bottoms-up process) which it explains through the concept of [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organization]].

It's a theory which has been used in the context of neuroscience, [[_MOC Psychology|psychology]],  education and [[Linguistics]] to help explain why things change over time rather than being fixed. It can also be applied within engineering contexts where it assumes that its input variables will not be fixed and can change, essentially nonlinear systems.

> Dynamic systems theory is a theoretical framework that seeks to explain how complex behavior emerges from the interactions between a person or organism and their environment. This theory suggests that behavior is not simply the result of fixed rules or [[Feedback loop|feedback loops]], but rather emerges from the interactions of multiple factors that are [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|constantly changing]] and evolving.

> According to dynamic systems theory, behavior is the result of self-organization, meaning that patterns of behavior emerge spontaneously from the interactions between multiple factors. These factors can include the physical environment, social and cultural contexts, [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]], and the individual's goals and motivations.
>
> One key concept in dynamic systems theory is the idea of "attractors", which are stable patterns of behavior that emerge from the interactions between multiple factors. Attractors can be thought of as the preferred or habitual ways of behaving in a given context, and they can change over time as the individual's goals and environment change.

> Another important concept in dynamic systems theory is the idea of "dynamical systems", which are systems that are [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|constantly changing]] and evolving over time. Dynamical systems can be thought of as a set of rules or principles that govern the behavior of the system as a whole.

> Dynamic systems theory has been applied to a wide range of domains, including psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and education. It has helped to shed light on how complex behavior emerges from the interactions between multiple factors, and has provided new insights into how we can understand and support learning, development, and adaptation over time.^[ChatGPT]

## What is the concept of self-organization within dynamic systems theory?

Self-organization in dynamic systems theory refers to **the ability of a system to spontaneously organize its own behavior or structure without being externally controlled or directed.**

Self-organization is a key concept in dynamic systems theory, as it helps to explain how complex, adaptive behavior can arise from simple, local interactions between components of a system.

This phenomenon occurs when the components of a system interact with one another in a way that leads to the **emergence of new patterns or structures at a higher level of organization**. These new patterns or structures are not predetermined or imposed from outside, but rather arise from the **collective behavior** of the system's components. Essentially, all the intermingling of things is a factor in itself. We can think of it like particles bouncing around together and providing their own sets of reactions.

## Application of dynamic systems theory to engineering

Principles of dynamic systems theory can be applied to systems to create control [[Algorithms|algorithms]] that are robust, adaptable and able to operate in complex and uncertain environments.  It could allow us to build space-faring robots that are antifragile?

> Dynamic systems theory can be applied in engineering, particularly in the areas of control systems, robotics, and mechatronics. In these fields, dynamic systems theory is often used to design controllers or algorithms that can adapt to changing conditions or environments, and to model the behavior of complex systems.
>
> For example, in control systems engineering, dynamic systems theory is used to design feedback control systems that can regulate the behavior of a system in response to external disturbances. These systems are designed to be self-correcting, meaning that they can automatically adjust their behavior to achieve a desired outcome, even in the presence of noise or uncertainty.
>
> In robotics and mechatronics, dynamic systems theory is used to model the behavior of robots or other mechanical systems, and to design algorithms that can control the behavior of those systems in response to changing conditions or tasks. Dynamic systems theory can help engineers to design robots that can adapt to a wide range of tasks and environments, and that can learn from experience over time.
>
> In general, the principles of dynamic systems theory can be applied in engineering to design systems that are robust, adaptable, and able to operate effectively in complex and uncertain environments. By modeling the behavior of complex systems as dynamic processes, engineers can gain insights into how those systems are likely to behave under different conditions, and can design controllers or algorithms that can adapt to those conditions in real-time.

## Dynamic systems theory is current state of the art

As of now, we don't have a successor theory as it's still an active area of research. There are related theories such as relational developmental systems theory, or complexity theory. It's at the current edge of our knowledge ([[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]).

Relational developmental systems theory for example is focused on a particular aspect such as social relationships and how they evolve over time.

Complexity theory on the other hand "emphasizes the importance of nonlinear relationships between multiple factors, and the emergent properties that can arise from those relationships."

## Advantages of dynamic systems theory

It provides some advantages over [[Control Systems Theory|control theory]]:

- Use in nonlinear systems which are hard to predict
- Systems which have high [[Cardinality|cardinality]]/[[Dimensionality|dimensions]]
- Systems needs to respond in response to changing conditions aka self-adapt

Nonlinear Systems: If the system under consideration is highly nonlinear, or if the behavior of the system is emergent and cannot be easily predicted, dynamic systems theory may be a better choice. Dynamic systems theory can provide insights into the complex, emergent behavior that can arise from the interactions between multiple factors, and can help to model and control nonlinear systems.

High-dimensional Systems: If the system under consideration has a large number of dimensions, or if the behavior of the system is highly complex and difficult to model, dynamic systems theory may be a better choice. Dynamic systems theory can help to model and control high-dimensional systems, and can provide insights into the behavior of these systems that may be difficult to obtain using control theory.

Adaptive Control: If the system under consideration needs to be adaptive, and able to adjust its behavior in response to changing conditions, dynamic systems theory may be a better choice. Dynamic systems theory can help to design controllers that are able to learn from experience and adapt to changing conditions, which may be important in some applications.
