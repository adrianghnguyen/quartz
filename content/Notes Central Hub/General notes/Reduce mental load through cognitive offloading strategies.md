# Cognitive offloading strategies help reduce mental load

> Cognitive offloading refers to the process of using external tools or resources to reduce the [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive load]] placed on our brains. It involves transferring mental tasks or information processing to external sources, such as technology or other people, in order to free up cognitive resources for other activities.

This concept has gained significant attention in psychology and cognitive science as researchers explore ways to enhance human cognition through the effective use of [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|external aids of thinking]]. It can help us deal with [[Working memory is limited|information overload]]. Be also wary of [[Information overconsumption|information overconsumption]].

By offloading certain cognitive processes onto external systems, individuals can free up mental resources to focus on [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|higher-level thinking]] and problem-solving activities.

It can mean taking advantage of [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|memory aids to help us remember information more easily]]. As [[Working memory is limited|working memory is limited]], this can help us focus our attention towards [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|higher-level thinking]] and engage in problem-solving activities.

Cognitive offloading can take various forms, such as using notebooks, checklists, calendars, or digital tools like Obsidian to assist in organizing and retrieving information. These external aids can help individuals keep track of tasks, deadlines, and ideas, allowing them to rely less on memory and distributed cognition more effectively. Moreover, by offloading information storage and retrieval onto external systems, individuals can access and review information more efficiently, aiding in creativity, decision-making, and overall cognitive performance.

There are several strategies or techniques that people employ for cognitive offloading:

1. Note-taking: Taking notes helps to offload information from our [[Working memory is limited|working memory unit]] and allows us to refer back to it later. Whether it's jotting down important points during a meeting or writing down ideas while studying, [[Writing to learn|note-taking helps in retaining information]] and reducing the need for mental recall.
2. Task reminders and alarms: Using reminders and alarms can help us remember important tasks or deadlines, reducing the mental burden of constantly trying to keep track of them. This strategy is commonly used for appointments, meetings, and other time-sensitive activities.
3. Digital organization tools: Utilizing digital tools like calendars, task management apps, and note-taking apps can help in organizing and managing information effectively. These tools provide a systematic way of storing and retrieving information, reducing the need for mental effort.
4. Outsourcing decision-making: Sometimes, we may rely on others to make decisions on our behalf. This offloads the cognitive load associated with decision-making, especially when dealing with complex or overwhelming choices. For example, seeking advice from an expert or consulting with a team can help in [[Make informed decisions|making informed decisions]] without solely relying on our own mental capacity.
5. Using technology for information retrieval: With the vast amount of information available online, we often rely on search engines and online databases for quick access to information. This allows us to offload the task of memorizing facts or details and instead focus on understanding concepts or applying knowledge.
6. Collaborative problem-solving: Working with others can distribute the cognitive load by sharing responsibilities and leveraging collective intelligence. Collaborative problem-solving allows individuals to contribute different perspectives and expertise, reducing the individual cognitive effort required to solve complex problems.

Overall, cognitive offloading strategies aim to optimize our cognitive resources by utilizing external tools, resources, and collaboration. By reducing the mental burden on our brains, we can enhance our productivity, decision-making, and overall cognitive performance.
