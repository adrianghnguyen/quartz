# Math definition

In mathematics, the concept of bracketing is using successive small intervals to find the root.

The bisection method is an example of this where we use  _c_ = (_a_ +_b_)/2 and continuously adjust and we look if the answer is closer to the upper and lower interval. We use this as our new midpoint and repeat the process until we get closer. We gain accuracy for each successive iteration of the interval.

# How else it can be applied

- Gaming: This technique can also be used to find the right sensitivity. Set a low-high bound, see which is more comfortable then average result. Repeat the process.

In life, sometimes we don't know what is the right answer or how to begin getting the correct one. By trying out extremes and examining results, we can see what is preferable and is a way to begin getting the right answer.
