> Self-actualization refers to the process of fulfilling one's potential and becoming the best version of oneself. It is a term coined by psychologist Abraham Maslow, who believed that self-actualized individuals have achieved a state of personal growth and fulfillment. This concept involves realizing and pursuing one's own values, interests, and passions, rather than conforming to societal expectations. Self-actualization is considered the highest level of psychological development, where individuals experience a sense of purpose, authenticity, and self-fulfillment.
