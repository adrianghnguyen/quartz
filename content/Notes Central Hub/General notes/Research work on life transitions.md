## Bruce Feiler's work on life transitions

### Quick summary

According to Bruce Feiler,
- Life transitions occur every 12-18 months due to some kind of life disruption/transition
- About 47% of life transitions are voluntary - they are a result of our [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal choices]]
- His research indicates that life transitions are not rare nor undesirable - contrary to popular belief
- Despite transitions begin common and self-imposed out of free will, most people will experience [[Fear|fear]], sadness (possibly [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopelessness]]), and [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|shame]].
- The role of life transitions is to help us [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|revise our life story]] and create new opportunities by [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|changing our beliefs and perspectives]]

In summary, we should learn to accept that life transitions are a [[Understanding the complexity of life|normal part of life]] and [[Cultural roots of shame|destigmatize the shame]] of going through transitions. 

### His research and lessons

> **Bruce Feiler** is a researcher and author of seven consecutive _New York Times_ bestselling books. In 2008 he was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive type of bone cancer that doctors believed would most likely take his life. Miraculously, after a difficult fight, Bruce beat the cancer and recovered. During that time, Bruce wrote a book about the experience. Having reflected on his fight with cancer, he then decided to begin a research project into our experiences with transitions.

> Bruce’s research revealed that we have one disruptor (transition) every 12–18 months. Most people tend to fear these transitions but surprisingly nearly half, or 47%, are voluntary— meaning we choose to initiate them. These findings debunk two of the most common beliefs about transitions: that they are rare and that they are undesirable. Transitions are common and typically self-imposed, yet surprisingly, the top emotions people experience during transitions are fear, sadness, and shame. Transitions obviously have a significant [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|impact on our happiness]].

> However, the productive role of transitions is to help us revise our life story and create new opportunities. In the transitions he studied, Bruce found that 90% of transitions were successful. This means that transitions aren’t cataclysmic life-stopping events but rather punctuations in our story. As professor and economist Herminia Ibarra suggests, “The in-between period is the crucible in which people and organizations forge new possibilities.” Rather than fearing transitions, we can learn to accept them as a normal part of life and destigmatize the shame of going through transitions, knowing that the vast majority are successful (90%) and intentional (47%).

## Lessons from the conversation between Bruce Feiler and Arthur Brooks on the Art of Happiness

1. The speaker conducted interviews and collected life stories from people across the country to understand transitions.
2. The [[Understanding the complexity of life|linear life]], with one job, one relationship, etc., is no longer the norm.
3. People experience multiple transitions throughout their lives, with one major life quake every few years.
4. Successful transitions involve [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|accepting emotions]], [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|shedding old habits]], and embracing creativity.
5. Involuntary transitions should still be approached with [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|commitment]] and voluntary engagement.
6. [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|Rethinking and revising our life stories]] is crucial for navigating life transitions.
7. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life will always have challenges]], but overcoming them allows us to be the heroes of our own stories.
