# Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied

#status/done

Related to [[Module 5 Worldly Rewards]]

We have a tendency to reset our expectations right after a big achievement, which lead us to constantly search for greater and bigger things.  The hedonic treadmill is a [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]] to understand the human inability to be content and satisfied. It causes us to be constantly shifting goal posts and makes finding happiness that much more difficult.

[[Happiness is a homeostatic process|Happiness is a homeostatic process]] and is a result of the human capacity for adaptation. Humans have a tendency to adapt to changes in our circumstances, whether positive or negative, and as a result, the initial boost in happiness or satisfaction that comes with these changes gradually fades over time.

The hedonic treadmill causes us to [[Social comparison|compare ourselves to others]] in terms of the eternal [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|search for happiness]]. According to some research, we have the false belief that earning 40% more than our current income will make us happier. [[Seeking additional money has diminishing returns on happiness|Having a higher income has diminishing returns on happiness after a certain threshold]].

For example, we may have a [[My personal bucket list|personal bucket list]]  which keeps growing forever until we become overwhelmed by its size and constantly shift our expectations causing us to be unhappy.

Instead, we should find sustainable sources of lasting happiness and understand our psychological tendency to be dissatisfied in order to overcome the hedonic treadmill. It can difficult to learn how to be [[Satisfaction is the ability to be content|content]] as our brains are simply not equipped for it.

## Brains are limited in their ability to experience satisfaction

We cannot experience satisfaction forever in an unsustainable manner as the process of [[homeostatic systems|homeostasis]] kicks in and results in a return to a baseline level of happiness. This in itself becomes a source of frustration.

According to Arthur Brooks within the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|course on managing happiness]]:

We should seek for other sources of satisfaction. "Hedonic is feeling" and causes us to chase and constantly want more. Eventually we faceplant and we need to undergo a nervous breakdown or a place of openness (some kind of emotional journey?) which will allow our brain to rewire itself which is a natural process. A lot of our initial value systems are driven by survival - accolades, scaling business, achieving a certain level of income.

It's evolving our [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual models]] of success to be something which is more [[Create meaningful goals which are authentic to you|meaningful and personal to us]]. We need to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|sit in]] and really experience those emotions to help our nervous system (such as the [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one Emotional Ring]]) experience those things more deeply.

## Changing internal views can help overcome the hedonic treadmill

We need to seek for deep satisfaction in different ways and reconcile our personal views of success with what [[Ask yourself if it sparks joy and happiness|we think will bring us true happiness]]. This may involve [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|reevaluating and realigning our values]], which can be scary but ultimately liberating. It can start by [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being appreciative for the small things]] and finding the [[Slow-life strategy is prioritizing quality and simplicity|simple pleasures of life]].

It may involve a process of [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grieving]] and [[Ask yourself if it sparks joy and happiness|letting go of aspects which don't bring true happiness]]. True happiness is often found through [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|quality relationships which increase our general life satisfaction]] rather than the [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|pursuit of the four idols]].

Remember that [[Happiness is a homeostatic process|happiness is a homeostatic process]] and that happiness tends to revert to the means. It can be more fruitful [[Satisfaction is the ability to be content|to learn how to be content]] and [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|keep life simple by removing the non-essential]].

## Personal reflections on the hedonic treadmill

It's funny because [[2023-07-17|Yesterday]] I was talking with [[Dominique Clement|my therapist]] and I mentioned that doing the 150km event during the [[Defi metropolitain|Defi m√©tropolitain]] seemed like such a far away achievement and it no longer resonated with me emotionally. I guess I have the answer in terms of it being the hedonic treadmill.
