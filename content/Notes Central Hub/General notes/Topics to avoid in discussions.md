# Topics to avoid in discussions

#status/done

Related to [[Have meaningful conversations]]

I feel like I'm a very friendly person and I'm pretty open in terms of discussing but sometimes I can pull back. There are people who may not match my intellectual curiosity or it's just not the appropriate time and place to discuss a certain thing and it's best to avoid. [[Oversharing creates discomfort|Overdisclosure]] can also sometimes blow black.

I know I can have strong political views and things like that at times and I think those might be better to keep to myself. I should only say what's needed and only of the people I trust and feel [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|intimate ]]should I share more, being candid.

## Avoid dicey topics such as those from PEAR

There also topics which we should avoid PEAR (Politics, Economics, Abortion, Religion). Unless we feel [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|truly close]] to someone and [[Trust is fluid|trust]] the other person, I think it's best to keep opinions on those [[Not everything needs to be shared|close to our chest]].

These kinds of conversations can spiral really quickly - becoming emotionally charged and someone will get eventually hurt. If so, I think it's important to [[Apologizing sincerely requires action|apologize sincerely]] and recognize the [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|gift of the relationship]].
