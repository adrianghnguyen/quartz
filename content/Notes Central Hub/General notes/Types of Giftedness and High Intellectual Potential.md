# Types of giftedness and high intellectual potential

#status/done

---

Giftedness ([[Defining high intellectual potential as a talent development process]]) can come under a mix of two main forms which will manifest itself as the child's talent ([[Types of Potential Talent]]):

- laminar (homogeneous) - associated with the scientist stereotype
- complex (heterogenous) - associated with the creative steeotype

Related to [[High intellectual potential overview]].

## Main profiles of high intellectual potential

There are two main profiles:^[Renzoulli, 2005]

Type of HPI profile | Concept handle | Traits
---| ---| ---
Laminar/Homogeneous | The scientist |  Rational, analytical towards situations as well as others, "more stable"
Complex/Heterogeneous | The artist |Creative, intuitive, typically has a harder time managing their emotions

It's important that there is so much inter and intra-group variance^[p.120 Bélanger Marianne. La Douance: Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et créatif, Midi Trente éditions, Québec, Québec, 2019.] that we should be careful to lump all the gifted children together but rather should consider them on a per-person basis. The [[Personality is shaped our environment|sociocultural factors]] also come into play such as upbringing, geography, etc.

## Homogeneous profile (laminar hpi)

Harmonious cognitive development of intellectual aptitudes between verbal and non-verbal. More 'fluid' type of intelligence and tends to be more stable. *You can think of this as the 'scientist'.*

### Behavioral characteristics of laminar hpi

- [[Analytical thinking is first-principles based|Analytical thinking is first-principles based]] which tends to be more linear
- Ease of learning
- 'Typical' societal image of the gifted person
- Greater capacity to adapt (for most) and fit into society
- Very sensitive to the expectations of others
- Easily fit into classroom settings but also at risk of being easily bored by the curriculum if left unchallenged
- Easily socially anxious (feelings of isolation, feelings of not being understood)

### Heterogeneous profile (complex hpi)

Gifted children within this category tend to be more creative and intuitive. *You can think of this as the 'artist'*

#### Behavior characteristics of complex hpi

- Difficulty with learning, motor skills or languages making it difficult to identify [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]]
- A more intuitive sense of creativity ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]])
- A type of thinking that is [analogical in seeing similarities/metaphors](https://www.jepense.org/pensee-analytique-et-pensee-analogique/) and is arborescent (resembling a tree)
- Traits of attachment and non-conventionalism
- Tend to be more hypersensitive ([[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children]])
- Academic performance which is more variable
- *Higher risks* of emotional ([[Mental Health]]) and behavioral issues ([[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances]])
