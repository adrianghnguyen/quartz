# Not asleep just yet - a lot on the mind

Related to [[2023-08-22]]

It's almost 1.30am and I'm still not asleep yet. I think my sleep schedule is kind of fucked up right now, actually. But we know that [[Sleep is important|sleep is important]] for personal well-being, especially mental health.

But I'm exactly not sure what's running through my mind. I feel like recently I have not had the best of sleep because of my flu.  If I'm thinking about what [[Dominique Clement|my therapist]] would say, she would probably say that I'm going through a tumultuous time in my life right now. I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with [[My career reflections and planning|my career]]. I'm trying to do dating. I just came back from a trip. And I guess if I put it in those terms, a lot of things have been going on for me.

So I guess it would be normal that I don't feel settled yet. I guess I'm trying to practice some [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]] at this moment.

Since I wrote so much about the course on happiness, there was a part where we talked about obsessive passion. And I'm starting to wonder if I have that issue right now, with what I'm trying to do about writing.

It feels like my life is all consumed by this, and it's all I do is breathe and sleep. Another more positive way of thinking about it is that perhaps I'm just in a moment of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|deep introspection]] where I'm letting a lot of feelings settle. The only advice I can give to myself in this moment is just to stay with my [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|center of gravity in terms of my emotions]].
