# Features to look for on gravel bike

- Good frame of the right size
	- It's better to err on a frame that is a bit smaller than too big as this can be adjusted with seat height and stem length
- Look for **hydraulic disc brakes**
	- They are superior to mechanical disc brakes
	- Disc brakes in general have superior all-weather braking conditions in comparison to rim brakes (can get clogged up by foreign materials)
- In terms of groupsets, **GRX** or 105 are ideal
	- GRX offers better gearing that is more suitable for gravel and off road.
	- It comes available in 2x and 1x. 2x provides more flexibility for recreational road cycling
	- Gearing should be 1:1 or lower
- Minimum tire size clearance should be **>35 mm** or as wide as it can possibly go
- Also consider modern endurance road bike which can support wider tires and has relaxed geometry
