# Coffee

#status/wip

[[Tran Huynh|My mom]] gave me an espresso machine a while back, and I didn't really drink any coffee before then. But I've had a lot of fun going down that rabbit hole and it became a hobby of mine. It's such a deep rabbit hole in terms of technical stuff. You can really nerd out about the chemistry and things like that. At some point I was even considering making my own water, but then I realized that maybe that's taking things a bit too far. It does get pretty expensive very fast, so I guess [[Nuggets of happiness|I'm pretty grateful]] that my mom gave me the machine.

## The joy of espresso

I drink espresso in the morning. I enjoy the [[My important rituals and daily routine|ritual]] more so than the caffeine itself I think. It's a nice time to reset and just meditate. It's also a fun way to discover more of the science of the art of making coffee and it helps [[Stay grounded and maintain perspective|stay grounded]] acting as a mantra that

> You can do the same thing as yesterday but the world may give you different outcomes.

In a way, it gives a sense of inner peace to relinquish control and focus on my inner self - to let go of [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|attachment and expectations]].

## Favourite coffee brands

- Kittel Signature Blend
	- Really nice and interesting and nutty chocolate taste.
- [Punch Buggy Espresso â€“ Detour Coffee Roasters](https://detourcoffee.com/collections/direct-trade-coffee/products/punch-buggy-espresso-1)
	- The test profile of chocolate nutty and cherry is really good when I'm able to get it properly.


## Making good espresso

1. **Roast Level:**
	- Light Roast: Use a slightly higher yield ratio to bring out the nuanced and brighter flavors without overwhelming the cup.
	- Dark Roast: Consider a lower yield ratio to balance the bold and intense flavors, preventing excessive bitterness.
2. **Origin:**
	- African Beans: These often have bright acidity and fruity notes. Aim for a slightly higher yield ratio to enhance these characteristics.
	- South American Beans: Known for balanced flavors, a standard yield ratio is suitable. Adjust as needed based on personal preference.
3. **Flavor Profile:**
	- Floral and Fruity Notes: Higher yield ratios can accentuate these flavors. Experiment within the recommended range to find the sweet spot.
	- Chocolate and Nutty Notes: Lower yield ratios may help maintain a balanced and rich taste without overpowering bitterness.
4. **Experimentation:**
	- Start with a standard ratio (e.g., 1:2 for espresso) and adjust based on taste preferences.
	- Small changes in the yield ratio can have a significant impact, so make adjustments gradually.
