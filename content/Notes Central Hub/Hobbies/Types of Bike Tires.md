# Types of bike tires

There are tons of different bike tires built for all sorts of different kinds of bikes, everything from skinny road racing slicks to big monster truck fat bike tires. In general, bike tires can be broken into a few different categories - organized by the type of riding.

## Road bike tires

Kings of asphalt & spandex, road bike tires are going to be slick and fast like a used car salesman. The relative consistency of road conditions and bias for efficiency means these tires can be skinnier and smoother so that they roll faster. Road bike tires usually measure in the 18c (or mm) to 32c range and are run at high pressures between 80 and 120 psi for maximum performance. There’s no real need for texture either but your off-season tires might have a little bit of texture to keep you rubber side down thru a puddle or slick patch.

## Urban / commuter bike tires

The definition of commuter is pretty flexible so the tires are going to be as well. Some folks commuting long distances will basically ride road tires whereas someone who blasts thru campus might want some grip across a cranky neighbor’s lawn. Most “commuter-specific” tires remain relatively slick for efficiency, but sport wider widths for additional volume and comfort for rough/cracked streets as well as puncture protection features to keep you on schedule.

## Gravel bike & cyclocross tires

A relatively new category for the masochistic cyclocross racers as well as the adventure/bikepacker, many of these tires are slimmed-down versions of XC mountain bike treads. Think of gravel and cyclocross tires as a cross between road and mountain bike tires. These may also be a good option for commuters who want a little bit more grip. Gravel bike tires often feature lower-profile tread patterns in the center of the tire, for lower rolling resistance, and more aggressive knobs on the outside of the tire for better handling and traction through turns.

## Mountain bike tires

Probably the most varied type of tire since the types of conditions are also varied. Hardpack dirt, loam, mud, clay and rock all require different knob patterns to keep you on your bike and to keep your Instagram page filled up for your fans. In general, mountain bike tires are much wider than other types of bike tires, with the high volume giving you the maximum grip and a cushier ride. Think of the air in your tires like an extra shock absorber. Plus, the tread pattern on mountain bike tires will be far more aggressive, to help you from sliding out in even the most sketchy of situations.

Generally, here’s what you can expect from modern bike tires in each category:
