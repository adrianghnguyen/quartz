## How to decide what types of hobbies are currently right for you

The process begins through [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] and determining your likes and dislikes. Then it's about [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|believing you are enough]].. Once you've had a shortlist, the next step is to actually [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|go ahead and try it out]]. Trusting your gut feelings which requires a certain level of knowledge of how one's self feels - something achieved with [[Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects|emotional intelligence]].

> If you're not sure what kind of hobby you want practice, there's no need to stress. To figure out where to start, sit quietly, listen to your [[Mind-body connection|mind and body]] and then experiment—across several categories, ideally.
>
> That's because Lucht contends that having hobbies across multiple or all of the categories can not only be fun, but can also contribute to keeping the mind, body, and spirit healthy and fulfilled. (Try thinking about your hobbies as you would a balanced nutrition plan.) This isn't to say that you must have a hobby that satisfies each of the categories, of course, but it is a component to consider during your self check-in, because ultimately, a balanced slate of hobbies may help you feel generally fulfilled.
>
> So, introspect about what kind of fulfillment you may feel is missing and which type of associated hobby might be right for you. When you find something that makes you forget about time and get into a flow state, that's how you'll know that you are doing the kind of hobby that will fulfill you the most. "This feeling of timelessness helps your mind wash away any anxiety or mental debris that keeps your thoughts running in circles, so the more in flow something makes you feel, the better it is for your mental and physical state," Lucht says.^[https://www.wellandgood.com/types-of-hobbies/]
