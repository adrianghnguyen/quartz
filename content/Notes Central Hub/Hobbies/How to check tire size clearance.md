# How to check tire size clearance

## Measuring tire size clearance

> [!warning] Recommend frame space clearance
> About 6mm per side apparently. Less if you feel spicy? Seems like you need to be cautious if your frame is made of carbon as you might get rub on the material easily.

- **1. Measure your current tires**
- Can be done using caliper. Make sure not to pinch otherwise it might skew measurements towards the too narrow.
- **2. Check your clearances**
	- Do in 5mm increments
- **3. Calculate your maximum tire width**
	- **max. tire width = 2 x (tightest clearance – 3 mm) + current tire width**
	- Example: Your current tires are 29 mm wide. You have 5 mm clearance at the **tightest spot.** That leaves 2 mm _available clearance (**5mm-3mm = 2mm remaining**)._ You can run 4 mm wider tires than your current ones. Your maximum tire width is 33 mm:

- They recommend 6mm clearance per side if gravel riding to account for mud. Might be tricky with my [[Aquila Equipe CX-D 2016|Aquila Equipe CX-D 2016]]. Maybe I can get away with a smaller size idk.
