- Since I mainly work in technical fields like data analytics, cooking is a nice form of expression, which is a form of [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|self-care]].
- I also learned from my [[Career Psychology Survey Results|career survey]] that I'm a person who really likes using my hands, who through dexterous activities like [[Origami|origami]].
- Cooking is also an exercise in problem solving and [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creative]] troubleshooting. Sometimes you may need to substitute ingredients.
- When you've achieved a certain level of [[The 10 000-hour rule|mastery]], you stop cooking by following recipes, rather, you try and understand the [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|fundamental principles]] that go in behind it, the techniques. There's a lot of joy of entering [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow state]] and simply 'cooking by feel'
- To a certain level, it's also an optimization problem. How should I do my food prep and organize my work environment to be the most efficient possible? In that aspect, I often look towards my [[The value of family|family members]], who are in the service industry and learn how they organize things.
- Lastly, it's my form of [[The five love languages|showing love]] by spending my time and energy share experience with another person - a form of [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connection]]

It's interesting because you can actually see the progression of my cooking from 2012 all the way to now. It's also an opportunity for me to improve my food photography skills.

## Cooking in my culture and upbringing

Cooking has always been very central to my life since growing up. I think it's common in Vietnamese families, or even Asian families in general, that one of the ways of displaying affection is through making food. At a young age, I was already watching my aunts and uncles, or my mom cook food. I think spending time in the kitchen with [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] was one of the few times I would have the opportunity to really [[The five love languages|spend quality time]].

### Culinary diplomacy

I do know that cooking has always been a way of sharing social conventions and exporting culture throughout human history. It's inherent to our nature. For example, Thailand uses their cuisine as a power of displaying soft power - a form of culinary diplomacy.^[Syafaat, Zahirah. (2022). CULINARY AS SOFT DIPLOMACY; THAILAND GASTRODIPLOMATION STRATEGY IN DEVELOPING THAILAND FOOD TOURISM. ]

## What's not so fun about cooking?

Honestly, I tell my friends often that if I did not enjoy cooking as a hobby, I would probably not do it. There was a time during university I was only in one real meal a day. The other times, I was mainly eating meal replacements or smoothies.

I think dishwashers are a great invention, especially when you're a single person. There's nothing more that sucks than cooking and having a whole pile of dishes. And then you need to take care of it. With that being said, I do find that there is some mindfulness aspect to dishwashing. I can feel the hot water running, smell the soap, and really practice [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|being grounded]].
