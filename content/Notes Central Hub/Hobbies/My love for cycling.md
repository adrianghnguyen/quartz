## Cycling is awesome dude

Having grown up in the suburbs, one of the primary ways I had around my neighborhood was to use my bicycle. Little did I know that the suburbs create [[car-dependency]] to get around anywhere yet my the bicycle, a simple mechanical device which turns the rotational energy of our legs into forward motion through the usage of one of the greatest inventions of all time - the wheel - TWICE! How freaking cool is that?

These days have discovered my love of a physical activity because of cycling. Living in Montreal, I now see how one doesn't need to drive a car around to get everywhere. I have so many options such as transit, the bike or even walking. I remember being so surprised when visiting Europe for the first time as an adult and being able to get around by using the metro, and as soon as I walk back towards our hotel, we would have passed by multiple little markets. It's not necessary to drive a car once a week to make a huge haul of grocery when you can simply pick something up in the neighborhood by stepping right out the door. I believe that [[active transportation has multiple benefits]] as well as [[urbanism]] philosophies of Europe contribute to their overall well-being.

In my current neighborhood, I am incredibly fortunate to have 3 supermarkets within a stone's throw - missing milk? I'll be back in a jiffy. I love cooking and having access to such a vast array of ingredients at my fingertips is simply delightful.

Montreal was lucky to inherit some of the [[urban planning]] principles of its mother country, France. I believe that Napoleon's city-design policies (?), through central planning dictated that each neighborhoods must be self-sufficient in terms of one bakery, butcher, etc. within a certain radius. I am most likely misremembering or even butchering the concept but it simply makes sense. Daily living should be convenient and getting into a 5 ton machine, driving back and forth makes little sense.

Cycling also provides me incredible freedom and allows me a nurture to make [[Curiosity as my worldview|curiosity]] by going where I feel like going. There's nothing to stop me. I can take any turn to my curiosity's desire. I feel like I have been able to discover my city so much more intimately by setting a point of interest marker and [[My hobbies and favorite activities|enjoying]] the journey. You feel  [[Nature promotes connectivity|connected with nature]], hearing the wind, the warmth of the sun. Just you and your breathing.

It can also be an incredibly social activity, which brings people together. It harkens back to an age of more innocent youth - just as I mentioned above. I have met so many new friends through this new hobby. It can be incredibly gratifying to work on repairing [[Aquila Equipe CX-D 2016|my bike]] and it's even helped me discover more on the human body's mechanics and physiology. I have learned to take better care of my [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body]] as a result of understanding proper posture, muscle movements, etc.

Even during winter, I have kept cycling which has greatly increased my fitness levels. It can be challenging at times, but isn't that half the enjoyment? To know I can push myself and to see how one can brave the mistress of weather? How [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|fun]]! Winter miles indeed make summer miles. I believe general health guidelines encourage us to spend at least half an hour in physical activity - I don't believe I need to expound on the benefits of avoiding a sedentary life. Getting around [[active transportation has multiple benefits|by bike]] is like a free gym session.

## Car dehumanize people

I have to admit I have had some close calls through drivers who are inattentive. Of course - having a close encounter with death makes it easy to be angry but afterwards, I need to understand that people are often uneducated about carbrain syndrome.

I had to argue with someone today about why 'taking the lane' is safer than straddling close to the edge and risk getting doored/mowed down by a passing vehicle.

Cars inherently dehumanize people by treating non-car objects. I would be interesting in seeing further neuroscience research on object recognition of drivers in vehicles. Based on my knowledge, intuition would dictate that the brain would be encouraged to first focus on objects resembling cars - leading to lower object recognition/response time to out of context stimuli.

## Urbanism is about delighting the users

I care a lot about [[urbanism]]. I think [[urbanism|cities should be pleasant]] and it's about delighting their citizens through creating infrastructure which keeps them healthy, and creates [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|a sense of wonder]].

Cycling is one of the [[active transportation has multiple benefits|best ways of getting around]] and allows us to connect with our environment as well as other people/society. There's a sense of comn

## Working with one's hands

It gives me an opportunity to learn how these wonderful engineering marvels operate. I can play with them - take them apart and learn how they work. I will encounter some difficulties but with a little patience and guidance from things like YouTube - most things can be solved. There's a lot to be cherished from this experience and it brings me a lot of personal joy.
