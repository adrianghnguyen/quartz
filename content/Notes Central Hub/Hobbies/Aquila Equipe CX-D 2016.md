# Aquila Equipe CX-D 2016

Bike I purchased in 2022 on Facebook, came with 3 sets of wheels. I use it paired with my [[Garmin Edge 530|Garmin Edge 530]].

## Swapping out cranksets

I'm currently running FC 6800s and they run Hollowtech ii mounts? Apparently this is only forward compatible with the FC-8000 165mm crankset I ordered. That means that installing them means I can't use my old chainrings unfortunately. I could keep them as a spare or something.

%%[Replacing Shimano crank arms with a shorter one. Need buying/parts advice : r/bikewrench](https://www.reddit.com/r/bikewrench/comments/13imuos/replacing_shimano_crank_arms_with_a_shorter_one/)  I asked for some advice here.%%

## Wheelsets

- RHUS 3.8 CCT
	- tubular wheelset
	- CS-5800 Cassette (11-28)
- Other wheelset
	- CS (11-32)

### Shimano RX31 Wheelset

- [Review: Shimano RX31 wheels | road.cc](https://road.cc/content/review/217446-shimano-rx31-wheels)
- clincher rim only
- Recommended tyre width 25-38c
	- The rims are 17mm wide internally (24mm externa) and Shimano recommends between 25-38c according to [Jenson Usa](https://www.jensonusa.com/Shimano-WH-RX31-Wheelset#:~:text=The%20RX31%20Wheelset%20offers%20an,high%20profile%20that%20improves%20aerodynamics.)
	- However, based on [[General Bike Websites Resources#Sheldon Brown|Sheldon Brown]],  and the [[Bike Tire Compatibility Chart]] this bike could support up to ~37c
- What is the maximum tire clearance I could use with it? [[How to check tire size clearance]]

### What does free stroke adjustment do?

> The free stroke adjustment on Shimano hydraulic brakes is a feature that allows you to adjust the amount of lever travel before the brake pads make contact with the rotor. This is useful for riders who want a more immediate or a more gradual engagement of the brakes.
>
> By adjusting the free stroke, you can change the point at which the brake pads engage the rotor. A shorter free stroke will cause the brake pads to engage earlier in the lever pull, giving a more immediate response. This can be useful for riders who prefer a more aggressive braking feel or need to make quick stops.
>
> Conversely, **a longer free stroke will cause the brake pads to engage later in the lever pull**, giving a more gradual response. This can be useful for riders who prefer a more gentle braking feel or need more modulation when braking.

### Adjusting free stroke on Shimano hydraulic brakes

> To adjust the free stroke on Shimano hydraulic brakes, you need to use a small hex wrench to turn the adjustment screw located on the brake lever.

> Turning the screw **clockwise** will *decrease the free stroke* - leading to more aggressive brake engagement,
> Turning it **counterclockwise** will *increase the free stroke* - leading to more brake modulation.
>
> It is important to note that adjusting the free stroke may affect the lever position and lever throw, so it's a good idea to check those as well after making any adjustments.
