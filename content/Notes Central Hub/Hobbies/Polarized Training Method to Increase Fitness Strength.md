# Polarized training method to increase fitness strength

## Benefits

According to research, periodized training is more effective than simply working in the middle zone. The goal is to stress the body and work at extremities. Very easy work and very hard work to allow the body to recover on easier days.

By staying within the high stress zones, it forces the body to adapt at processing the lactate from high intensity work.

## Program

**Do note that due to the high stress from its intensity, it's important to take easy days with a low resting heart rate**

### Key features

- Warmup
- x3 Short burst high intensity -> Cooldown
- Recovery

### Sample exercise program

| Section | Time |
| --- | ---|
| Warmup | 15 mins |
| Set | 30s on of sustainable power, 30s off for a total of 10 mins  |
| Recovery | 5 mins |
| Repeat | Do set/recover for 1-3 sets while seated |

### Others types of training

1.  **High Volume Low Intensity Training (Long slow distance)**: Training composed mostly of long, low-intensity workouts; often associated with base training. 
2.  **Threshold Training (THR):** Training primarily occurring at moderate intensities, not to be confused with the Threshold Power Zone or Threshold intervals (these are actually high-intensity efforts)
3.  **High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**: Training mostly composed of short, hard efforts at high intensity and low volume
4.  **Pyramidal Training (PYR):** Training at a mix of intensities, with the most time spent at low intensity, less time at moderate intensities, and the least time spent at high intensity. Most TrainerRoad training plans are Pyramidal in design.
5.  **Polarized Training (POL):** Training mostly at high or low intensity, with little to no time spent training at moderate intensity.

Take it easy  most of the time ride in Z2. Likewise, the overall routine is pretty simple. Keep it simple stupid (KISS).
