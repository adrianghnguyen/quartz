# General bicycle maintenance

Since I began [[My love for cycling|cycling]], I felt it really enjoyable to learn how to maintain my own bikes. compared to cars, they're much more simple devices, so it is easier to understand what is happening. I also really enjoy working on my hands, which is something I didn't really know was so enjoyable.

I'm learning a lot of valuable skills by also [[Third Place|volunteering at a bike repair co-op]] at op  %%Santropol Roulant/Santrovelo%%. It's also an opportunity for me new people and be part of a new community.

## Where to purchase bike maintenance stuff

- Decathlon sells cheap bike inner tubes as well as a 20$ undersling frame bag

## Bike chains

### Master chain quicklinks

Why use quick chain links?
- They're easier for maintenance often requiring less tools and easier for maintenance
- Some of them can be reused like Connex links
- Can be easier to be carried as spares

Tips:
- You can use master chain links instead of traditional connection pins which requires a chain breaker
	- You can also use pedal force while holding the quick link in the upper area^[See timestamp on [Chain quick links: A quick guide to easy connection - YouTube](https://youtu.be/e-JRkZwuLAs?t=106)]
- Most are often single-use but **[Connex Links are reusable ones](https://www.cantitoeroad.com/Connex-Links-8-9-10-11-12-speed_c_48.html)**
- It needs to match your current chain type (the appropriate speed)
- Be careful of the *direction of installation* as it can be marked on the chain
- Older speeds such as 8 or 9 spd are easier to put together by hand while 10+ spd may require the use of of a **quick link tool**
