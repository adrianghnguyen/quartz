# Develop good habits through routines and rituals

#status/wip  #personal

I am starting to understand the importance of rituals. It's meant to act as a failsafe for when we fall back upon our more primitive drives. It's a form of [[Feedforward control|feedforward control]] where our past selves understands our baseline behaviours and seeks to nudge us in a positive direction.

- Engaging in [[My important rituals and daily routine|my important rituals]], allows me to focus on performance and time [[My core values define what matters|learning new things]] and [[Become focused by managing attention|stay focused on work]].
- It can be [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|difficult for me to follow routines]], which makes them that much more important. I try and build incremental habits so I avoid engaging in [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behaviors]].

## Rituals and routines help us manage exertion levels

They can help us provide an overall consistency for our [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|energy levels]] rather than spiking.

Funny how in cycling, you want to maintain a steady tempo rather than going into the red zone where it is much harder to recover - call that burnout syndrome. It's a way of preventing excessive [[Fatigue|fatigue]].
