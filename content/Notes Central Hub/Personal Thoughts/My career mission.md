# My career mission to help shape long-term goals and actions

#status/wip   #personal

Related to [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission]]

> "To leverage technology, [[Cognitive science]], and [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence (AI)]] in the therapeutic workspace to promote mental well-being, empower individuals, and advance the field of mental health through innovation, research, and the development of AI-driven interventions."

When I think to [[My ideal work|my ideal job]], I see the following themes:
- Technology - ideally something which uses cognitive science or adjacent?
- Desire to help people/altruism
- Applied research - using knowledge from the cutting-edge theories and applying it to a specific use case. For example, using modern cognitive theories to be deployed in applications and operationalizing them.
- Management/influence

Many of the [[Personal sources of inspiration|people who inspire me]] are cognitive scientists who brought interdisciplinary expertise to study the brain, using [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] and apply it to technology. I hope to get into that space one day.

I need to find out who's in this space and who I could potentially work for. I need to do some research on [[Mental health companies|mental health tech companies]] and see existing working opportunities/network with them.

It's important to remember that this will probably change over time, and that's okay. Going through [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|life is an iterative process]].

>  - Identify the core values that matter to you the most. For example, it could be promoting mental well-being, empowering individuals, advancing technological innovation, or fostering human connections.
>   - What's the impact I want to have in the industry?

## My career objectives and goals

These should derive or be related to my career mission. It should be coherent and in line my personal values. It's okay if they're long-term goals or not immediately relevant. I think it's part to just brainstorm and imagine what the possibilies are. To dream and think about what I want to achieve in life.

I will want to refine this and convert them into actionable goals at some point. 

What do I want to accomplish in life when it comes to my career? What would give me a [[Sense of accomplishment and personal pride|sense of accomplishment]]?
