# Second brains

Digital gardens are people's personal repositories of knowledge. I often use them as a shorthand to learn how to begin approaching a topic as they've done the tough mental work of collecting information, sources and evaluating them. They can also be inspiration to learn from.

In a way it's like having a teacher or relying upon the work of others as there are very little original thoughts or ideas considering how long humanity has lived. So why not use what's out there rather than creating from scratch? See [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]

Of course, it's important to step back and think about how this applies to us. But having a compass is a great way of [[Building momentum and getting things started|getting started]] and avoids one falling into the trap of simply learning ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]]).
