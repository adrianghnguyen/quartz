## We are all connected

When you realize that just like how everything is connected, a Buddhist philosophy, in the world, you begin to realize that others are just like you. They grew up on planet earth, were hurt by words, had parents, friendships and moments of doubt you learn to become more empathetic.

Everyone needs others to survive due to our [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|need to belong]] It is crucial to our [[Purpose in life|personal success]]. There are many examples of the [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|need for connection]]. In nature, we can see how trees form networks which support each other as explained in [[Finding the Mother Tree by Suzanne Simard|Finding the Mother Tree by Suzanne Simard]].

To build monumental structures, it is not done by one person but by a group of people working together to achieve a goal through interdependency. When humans created the world wide web - the internet, one of the most important technological advances in the history of humankind, it allowed us to connect information, build systems and share things with one another across the world. If we go backwards in time, wheels were a significant invention with their ability to connect towns across distances. As we can see, the [[Nature promotes connectivity|world is ruled by connections]].

## The importance of your own self

However, as with many things, there is an equilibrium state when it comes to realizing the sense of our [[Nihilism posits that life has no inherent meaning or purpose|meaningless]] on the cosmic scale. It is important to not lose the [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|sense of self]] and to maintain a [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|love of the self]] and to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|honour our feelings]] - by [[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown|daring greatly]].

*It is possible to acknowledge the complexities of the other while [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|respecting the validity of your own perspective]]. Being empathetic does not mean ignoring the other's wrongs or [[Forgiveness increases well-being|choosing to forgive]] for the sake of [[Forgiveness increases well-being|forgiving]] - that would be robbing from yourself to give to the other.

## A rich inner world others will never see

It is to understand that it cannot be possible to fully comprehend the other person's journey and the marks that history has left them, resulting in the offending behaviour. If one can understand that to really understand another person, one must have the exact same experiences as the other up until this point in their life. With this knowledge, we can begin moving from selfish desires of wanting the other to fully understand us - the principle of reciprocity.

We can then begin to forgive others for not having complete comprehension as they do not have access to all our information as [[Subjectivity is implied|filtered through our world lens]]. We give ourselves much leeway in explaining our poor behaviours while being uncharitable in explaining that of the other - a [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive bias]] called the [[fundamental attribution error]].

Empathy is about understanding that other people have different bias and [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] by which each of us operate. When trying to communicate with them through techniques such as [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|active listening]], really seek to understand their personal interpretations of the world.

## Relationship between [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]], self-worth and empathy

When we are easily hurt as a result of the attack on our [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|perceived image of the self]], we enter a [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mindset]] which makes it hard to be charitable towards the other.

One approach is to examine the source of our hurt and [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feelings]] as well as being able to vocalize the source of pain. A [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|feelings chart]] may prove useful in this regard.

Another would be to improve your self-esteem which was proven to increase empathy - at least in Chinese medical students^[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712570/].

### Practicing empathy through acceptance

Even understanding the logic behind [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|biases]] is not enough. [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|Empathy]] is a skill which is earned through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]]. It can involve [[Listen with empathy during conversations|sympathetic listening]] and [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|staying with their emotions]] in their [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|moments of vulnerability]].

The first step to begin this process is to understand that perhaps we shouldn't be [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|quick]] to [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|judge others]].

### Gratitude towards yourself

With gratitude towards the self, with the mind [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being grateful]] for the body, the vessel or [[Mind-body connection|external interface]] by with which the [[Mind-body connection|mind interacts with the world]].

[[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|Disrespecting your body]] is letting it fall into disrepair by not nursing injuries, being inattentive to protect it to danger/[[fear]] and by avoiding exercise to maintain its condition.

It's about recognized our [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|shared common humanity]] which helps us engage in gratefulness, with its many [[Neurological effects of gratefulness|neurological benefits]]. That's why when we feel strong emotions towards others, it can important to remember the [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|gift of the relationship]].
