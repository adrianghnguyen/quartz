## Acquiring my Aerogarden Harvest Elite

On [[2023-04-04|April 4th 2023]], I acquired an aero garden planter - the exact model is the [Harvest Elite](https://aerogarden.com/gardens/harvest-family/harvest-elite.html)! Normally, those things retail about $200, but I got really lucky this time only having paid $20 including rummaging for a compatible charger. It's not the first time I've ever hunted for one, but patiences does seem to pay off. It didn't come with any planter, so I need to research that. I found a couple of 3D print molds online which I will see if my friend %%[[Justin Li]]%% can print out for me. I believe that the role of those pots to sustain the plant in submerged water. This is the perfect opportunity for me to grow my Vietnamese herbs and have them all year round to cook with.

## Hardware requirements for Aerogarden

- [Aerogarden Replacement Grow Cup by RDBRULZ - Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2087178) <- think this is the best candidate?

I guess I would have to find all the equivalent, or at least see why they're important.

### Request for printing

I settled on this. %%Asking [[Justin Li]] to print it for me%%

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3981269/comments <- x6 pod with cap (apparently you may need to slow down the printing speed? based on a comment)
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1177064 <- x6 cover
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4690784 <- x6 (just need one of the 3 models - can you check of the spiral versions would work with the pod? I can't really tell)

### Basic aero garden pod plants parts

![[Pasted image 20230404180942.png|400]]

1. Sponge growth material
2. Grow dome
3. Grow basket
4. Pod label - is that the paper thing?
5. Liquid nutrient

## How do hydroponic and aerogardens work?

- Seeds sit in a special sponge that soak up a nutrient mix.
- Plants will sip on the water as needed.
- The two primary requirements for plants to grow is nutrients and light in the proper measure - soil is not needed.
	- If you have hard water, you can use purified water instead.

### Aerogarden basics

### Why do aerogardens have plastic covers?

> [!ai] AI
> Aerogardens have plastic covers to create a controlled and enclosed environment for the plants. The cover helps to maintain humidity levels, regulate temperature, and prevent pests or contaminants from entering the system. It also helps to reduce water evaporation and keeps the nutrient solution clean. Additionally, the cover prevents excess light from reaching the plants, which can cause damage or affect growth. Overall, the plastic cover is an essential component of an aerogarden system that ensures optimal growing conditions for plants indoors.

You can DIY some tinfoil to prevent excess light from entering into the roots.

### How high should the lights be?

Ideally, you want to keep the lights about 4-6″ above the top of the plants. This is easy at the beginning and gets harder as the plants grow at different rates. I always try to keep the lights at about 4-6″ above the tallest plants. Why is this important? Well, if the leaves get too close to the lights they will start to burn.

### How to grow cuttings in the aero garden?

Just stick the cuttings in the pod.
