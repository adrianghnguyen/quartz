# How I organize my life

## General core principles

- Steal from the best. [[Getting things done philosophy]].
- Combine tools where possible to reduce the [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive overhead]]
- Use the minimum of tools possible up until I reach a tipping point where I need to add on top of my workflow using a MVP approach. . [[Complex structures should emerge from simple systems|Structure should emerge out of natural context.]]
- [[Become focused by managing attention|Manage attention proactively]].
- Seek to [[Create a distraction-free environment|reduce distractions in my surrounding environment]].
- Practice [[Digital Minimalism|digital minimalism]]
- Use [[Ad-blocking technologies|ad-blocking]] tech.

## Life management tools

[[Become focused by managing attention|Manage attention proactively.]]

### Obsidian

- Deeper thoughts go into **Obsidian** as it should represent the sum of my [[Transform information into knowledge|knowledge and information]] as I keep adding to it based on evergreen note principles
- [[Why I write in Obsidian|Why I use Obsidian]]

### Google Keep

- When on the move, important things to remember go into **Google Keep**
	- Obsidian can be a bit cumbersome to use on mobile devices
- Any quick one liner thoughts which need to be expanded upon go into the pinned 'Fleeting thoughts' note
- Any deeper thoughts which are more complex go into their own Purple note (to remind me that it's destined for Obsidian).
	- The title should provide a thesis.
	- The content/sentences are more freeform thought. Add in references to concepts/links/relationships as they come up during the thinking process

### Google Calendar

I split my Google Calendar into multiple contexts - my daily life and my time with loved ones.

1. Personal calendar where I track my personal time commitments
2. Social calendar fed through a tool dynamically where my [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|friends]] book time appointments with me. These are then imported and checked for conflict with my primary personal calendar.
	1. These are pink/flamingo calendar to help remind me they're social events and [[My personal love languages|spending quality time]] with people, which make me feel warmâ€¦.so pink/orange <3 A type of attentional cue if you will.

The calendars remind me with notifications as needed 1 hour before the event, 10 mins before the event and 1 min before the event. It's creating a [[multiple layers of defense|swisscheese hole error model]] of digital [[Reduce mental load through cognitive offloading strategies|reminders]].

### Google Tasks

- Actions which I wish to accomplish in a trackable way
- Main categories:
	- Personal habits
	- Daily/GTD tasks
	- Working towards dreams/[[Make progress towards long-term goals|long-term goals]] ([[Purpose in life]] and [[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet]])
	- [[Why I write in Obsidian|Obsidian]] maintenance
- I tend to set a deadline for tasks which I find important as it helps provide a constraint. Things left undetermined will end up being fleeting.

### Sticky notes

- I use Sticky Notes to help write things before I forget them due to our [[Working memory is limited|limited memory]].
- I am pretty liberal in their placements - I have at least 7 block pads around the apartment in strategic locations like my bedside table, office, living room couch, kitchen table, etc.
- Sometimes I am in context spaces where I wish to [[Digital minimalism|limit digital interactions]]

### Voice commands through Google Assistant

- I make liberal use of Google Assistant. I have one in practically every single room.
- Whenever I think of something important, I write it down physically on my sticky notes, or I send it into my Google ecosystem such as Google Shopping List or Google Tasks which works by voice command]

## Messaging others

When trying to coordinate plans or working with other people, I try to do all the thinking in the moment I'm in contact with them. So I try to preemptively think through the scenario and try to leave my messages as direct actions or requests, leaving them free of ambiguity or response.

## Create separation by contexts

- Batching similar tasks together makes it easier to maintain focus.
- Use of virtual desktops to provide specific contexts to do things. It primes the mind to be ready to do specific work
	- Obsidian writing
	- Obsidian support (Research that's not being actively used in writing - it's easy to go down rabbit holes)
	- Daily life (Music + Calendar and just admin stuff)
	- Social (all my messaging is linked through my PC so I don't need to use my cellphone)

## Limit notifications and reminders to priority channels

- Concentrate messaging by priority channels
	- I limited my notifications to text messaging and Signal only. If anyone wishes to contact me in real-time, those are the options which I notify people.
	- All other messaging channels are considered non-priority and have no notifications or sounds.

## Productivity enhancers

### Speech to Text technology

Recently I've been using speech to text technology very extensively. I have it set up on all my computers to be able to type, saving my wrists in ergonomics. Additionally, on my phone, I also use Google's voice typing. The technology has matured quite a bit by this point. I remember a long time ago, maybe in the early 2000s, speech to text technology was very wonky and would often be inaccurate.

### ChatGPT for idea assimilation

Recently, [[Large language models produce human text using big data]]  technology has really progressed. With it came the birth of ChatGPT. I can see how much this technology is going to change, how we assimilate information. However, we need to be careful because the systems at this time hallucinate a lot. Based on current technology, it seems like it's very good assimilating data, and even leveraging [[System-level intelligence|collective intelligence]]. It does have its limitations covered in [[REF Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early experiments with GPT-4|Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early Experiments with GPT-4]].
