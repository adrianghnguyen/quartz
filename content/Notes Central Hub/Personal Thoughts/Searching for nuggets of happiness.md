# Searching for nuggets of happiness

## My mason jar of happiness

A while back, I used to have this little mason jar where I would enter little paper slips where I would write out what I would [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|be grateful for]] through my day to day life. I never understood the value of [[Writing to learn|writing things down]] but externalizing the moment of happiness on a piece of paper makes it feel tangibleâ€¦feel real. No longer a fleeting thought or left as [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]].

Something to hold. Something which is physical. More than a mere [[Memory is processed information|memory]].

## Creating nuggets of happiness

I guess the next step forward of this routine are my [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|nuggets of happiness]] . To cook them, it requires [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate effort]] in order to [[Happiness requires action|produce happiness]]. No one has ever made a cake appear out thin air after all.

One of the happier birthdays which I remember during [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood]] is a party which was hosted at the local McDonald's restaurant. I think they gave me a tour of their kitchen (I was fascinated by the cook line machinery) and they made it a memorable event. Many friends were there as well - maybe [[Tran Huynh|mom]] has some pictures somewhere. As a result, I guess I do think of the fast-food chain as a happy place.

I have fond memories of having McNuggets with my mom when we would pass by the drive-through during my younger years. Perhaps it's why I have a sentimental attachment to the word 'nugget'. The restaurant is known for their happy meals after all.

### Digging for gold

If we want a more mature analogy, we can relate it to golden nuggets - like the Yukon Gold Rush. We're all fools seeking for it but is it that easy to obtain and become rich with it? Some would say that [seeking for happiness may be a poor strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igBgTLYX5IU). However, I believe that [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|anything can be learned as a habit]]. They're rare. They're precious. And you need to [[Prospect Theory explains human irrationality and heuristics for loss minimization|prospect]] for them.

Nuggets can also be made of gold. We need to look at our surroundings and [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|pay attention]]. There's a lot of dirt. A lot of noise in the world caused by such things as [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|toxic people]]. Learn to discard and concentrate on the gardens producing golds - the [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|valuable and replenishing relationships]] and you'll be able to find your golden nuggets of happiness more easily.

## Happiness should delight users

Nuggets of happiness are like video game Easter eggs or delighting the user through unexpected but pleasant surprises, a concept introduced by [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]]. In this case, you're your own user.

For example, [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|messaging friends unexpectedly]] and telling them you are thinking of them is also a form of delighting the end user - your (potential?) friend.

I also realize now that communication is like good product design. If you fail to empathise and form proper connections and build the right signifiers in your verbiage, you will fail to introduce your idea.
