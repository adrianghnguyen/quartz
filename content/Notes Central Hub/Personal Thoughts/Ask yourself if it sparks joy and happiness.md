## Marie Kondo's approach of asking if it sparks joy

Minimalism [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|like any other skill]] can be improved through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]].

Marie Kondo, when asking the question *'Does it spark joy?'*, captures the essence of personal importance within minimalism. If you are deciding whether or not you should keep an object, or [[Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials|something else within your life]], ask yourself if it elicited any emotional reaction. Often times, our visceral and gut reactions tell us something.

If not, perhaps consider letting it go. We can [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|practice gratefulness]] for the time it has spent with us and recognize that its [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|journey will now diverge]].

## Will it bring me happiness?

Advice from the Dalai Lama on daily decisions on if it will add to our happiness.

> "But there is a better approach: framing any decision we face by asking ourselves, “Will it bring me happiness?" That simple question can be a powerful tool in helping us skillfully conduct all areas of our lives, not just the decision whether to indulge in drugs or that third piece of banana cream pie….Approaching our daily decisions and choices with this question in mind shifts the focus from what we are denying ourselves to what we are seeking—ultimate happiness."

> Marie Kondo, a Japanese organizing consultant and author, has gained worldwide recognition for her unique approach to decluttering and organizing spaces. Her philosophy revolves around the idea of only keeping items that "spark joy" in our lives. While her method has primarily been associated with [[Create a distraction-free environment|tidying up]] physical surroundings, it can also be applied to our emotional well-being and overall happiness.
>
> Kondo's principle of sparking joy encourages individuals to evaluate their possessions and determine whether they bring true happiness into their lives. By consciously selecting items that evoke positive emotions, one can create an environment that fosters happiness and contentment. However, Kondo's philosophy extends beyond material belongings; it also emphasizes the importance of taking action to cultivate happiness.
> In essence, [[happiness requires action]] – both in terms of physical decluttering and in our daily lives. It is not enough to simply surround ourselves with things that spark joy; we must actively pursue activities and relationships that bring us genuine happiness.
>
> Applying Kondo's philosophy to our personal lives means identifying the things or experiences that truly spark joy within us. This could include hobbies, spending time with loved ones, pursuing personal goals, or engaging in [[External gratitude is publicly expressing gratitude to the world and others|acts of kindness]] towards others. By actively seeking out these sources of joy and incorporating them into our daily routines, we take charge of our own happiness.
>
> Moreover, the act of decluttering itself can be a transformative experience. The process involves letting go of items that no longer serve a purpose or bring us joy. This act of letting go can extend beyond physical possessions – it can also involve releasing negative thoughts, toxic relationships, or unfulfilling commitments from our lives.
>
> By taking action to declutter both physically and emotionally, we create space for new opportunities and experiences. We allow ourselves to focus on what truly matters to us and make room for things that align with our values and bring us genuine happiness.
>
> However, it is important to note that achieving happiness requires ongoing effort and maintenance. Just as physical clutter can accumulate over time, emotional clutter can also build up if we neglect to regularly reevaluate our priorities and let go of what no longer serves us.
>
> In conclusion, Marie Kondo's philosophy of sparking joy teaches us that [[happiness requires action]]. It is not enough to passively wait for happiness to come to us; we must actively seek out and cultivate joy in our lives. By decluttering both physically and emotionally, we create space for happiness to flourish and make way for meaningful experiences and connections.
