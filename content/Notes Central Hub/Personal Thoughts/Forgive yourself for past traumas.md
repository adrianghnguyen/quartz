> Know that you did everything you could in that moment to protect yourself; grant yourself forgiveness for the things you may still blame yourself for, recognizing that the trauma is the fault of the perpetrator alone.
>
> And imagine yourself as you are now, safe and whole, sitting quietlyâ€”or imagine yourself embracing yourself as you were then, offering yourself the comfort and security you needed then, with reassurance that you survived, that your life got better.
>
> This is your new pattern: Allow the feelings to move through you.
