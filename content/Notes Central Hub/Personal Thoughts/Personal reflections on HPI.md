# My personal reflections with high intellectual potential

#status/done

Growing up, I often felt like I was different from others. I had a sense of isolation and mental loneliness - why do other people always feel so far away from me?

Perhaps that's a reason why I learned to practice [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]], seeking to bridge the gap and [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|others]]. It took me a long time, but I finally learned to build myself a community which can provide me the love I sought ([[The need to belong is the root of social connection]]).

I grew up in Ottawa in a predominantly white culture - I was one of the very few Asians growing up. Call it embedded racism, high expectations of me or whatever but we would often have live battle royale style math competitions in class and I would often be expected to win or place in the top ranks.

According to the the multiple intelligence theory ([[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences]]), I think I was potentially gifted in many different areas. In linguistic competitions such as spelling dictation competitions, I was one the finalists in grade 4 or so with little practice.

When I first began the piano, my teacher - also a talented individual - saw my potential and would push me to go into competitions despite only having started 4 months ago. My main remembrance of my first piano competition is completely bombing out and freezing. It's not the first time that this has occurred to me. Around grade 11, with Mr. Blakely, I also froze out on a math test with my mind going completely blank. Math wasn't exactly hard to me - it still required a level of effort which [[Tran Huynh|my mother]] encouraged but I feel like I had a natural aptitude. My mom did comment that at a young age, I was already able to practice a high level of [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|empathy]]. I think in general, I have very high anxiety during performance tests. Funny enough - they tried to give me an IQ test and I'm pretty sure I froze out on that too, lol.

My [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|biological dad]] had passed away when I was 2 years old ([[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI]]), and around the time, since I could be a difficult child, I was often soothed by being given orange juice. My mom told me that she was once crying, learning to deal with the [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] and I brought her orange juice and patted her on the back. This would be an example of displaying high levels of emotional empathy ([[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children]]).

While watching a video about geniuses ([[Traits of geniuses]]), they mentioned that many of them were faced with mortality at a young age ([[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss]]) and they posit the theory that this forces one to reduce this [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency]] by becoming intensely [[Curiosity as my worldview|curious]] about the world. I think that's a link to [[Neuroticism]] on which I score very highly ([[Career Psychology Survey Results]]) in the 99th percentile.

I think my family's also commented on the fact that I've been able to dance and move around at an early age, once again suggesting early developmental childhood milestone ([[Developmental Milestones in Children with HPI]]). Maybe I'm wrong?

Interestingly enough, in my career psych result, I scored like 5 out of 100 on interest in physical activities. [[Mathieu Guenette]] commented that this is strange. People with a low interest in the sector may only score something like low 30s so this is an extreme reaction - perhaps a sort of defensive mechanism ([[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego]]) to trauma ([[Brain-Body Disconnect During Trauma]]). There's something I won't comment on here but my mom would use certain words when describing other temperamental children and I now realize that one my maladaptive behaviors ([[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances]]) was shutting down my body.

We can also see that based on my writing, verbal-linguistic intelligence and being trilingual is perhaps within my talented giftset. Fascinatingly enough, being trilingual has opened me new worlds in terms of understanding the etymology of words. I've been listening to ['화(火花)(HWAA)' Official Music Video by g-idle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3szNvgQxHo) and I just made the connection that it's also how flower is pronounced in Vietnamese.

Perhaps this means that if I focus on learning languages - something which I don't personally have a great interest in TBH - I could acquire them correctly. I know French which is the base of latin and Vietnamese which has roots in Chinese mandarin which heavily influenced things like Korean of which I consume a great amount of media ([[My hobbies and favorite activities]]). In general, I read pretty well/fast, and have strong foundation with words in a rich vocabulary.

As far as I can remember, I've only had 90+ averages in school and anything less was kinda shunned by the family. Now, perhaps we can attribute this to my "tiger mom", cultural Asian expectations or genetic intelligence factors ([[General Intelligence Factor]]). Who knows? Life is complex and it's probably a mix of everything. Based on what I've learned about HPI ([[High intellectual potential overview]]), talent is a developmental process. So perhaps I can practice a bit of gratefulness for them pushing me a bit further.

Do note that not everyone should be pushed and the manners in which it was done can cause one to develop maladaptive behaviors ([[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances]]) later on in life through the rise of [[Mental illness|mental health issues]] like anxiety ([[Theories of creativity and motivation#Anxiety and Boredom as a Brake]]).

My personal theory is that HPI can be a positive adaptive behavior of [[Neuroticism|Neuroticism]] which has been correlated with [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]].

It's been beautiful learning more about myself ([[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough]]) and recognizing how beautiful my brain can be ([[Why I write in Obsidian]]). I don't need others - *I have me and that's enough.*
