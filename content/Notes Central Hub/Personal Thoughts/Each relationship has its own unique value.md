I'm thinking back to what Esther Perel provided and she said that one of the common things that our modern relationships or romantic ones provide too many expectations from a single person.

Each person provides their own value through their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal garden]] and perhaps it's more beneficial to [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|be appreciative]] for their [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connection to us]]. It's part of seeing them as they are rather than through a [[Cognitive distortions|distorted lens]] of our preconceived notions.

A [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|person is unique]] and they have their own [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal experiences]] with each person bringing something special to the table through their own personal niche.

But I guess that's why it's so important to have a lot of different close relationships because each of those bring in their own perspectives and they can support us in various different ways. [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|Different friendships can provide different functions]]. Each friend is special in their own way.
