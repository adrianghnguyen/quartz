Showing up is half the battle. The key is to build [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|good habits]] rather than hoping for [[Perfectionism|flawlessness]] right off the bat. We can choose to [[Strategies for behavioural change|celebrate that little victory when we engage in that good habit]]. There is value in trying to show up when [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|making new habits]].

It's committing ourselves to [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|doing the thing]] rather than engaging in [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopelessness]]. I choose to [[The difference between scarcity vs abundance mindset|be optimistic with a growth mindset]] when facing difficulties. That's the [[My core values define what matters|kind of person I would like to be]].

Showing up also provides us with the chance to meet opportunities as they arrive. Nothing comes for free, but if we see an opportunity, we should learn to make the most of it.

It's choosing [[Non-zero day mindset|non-zero days]] and not letting the [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|fear of failure]] hold us back. It takes [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]] to succeed and overcome [[Learned helplessness is giving up after repeated failures|learned helplessness]].

## The value of showing up according to James Clear

> “People often think it's weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up.

> The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can't learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis.

> James told the story of a guy that wanted to lose weight. He went to the gym every day, exercised for five minutes, and then he went home. Seems like a waste of time to me but this guy was mastering the art of showing up. He was building a habit of putting on his workout clothes and driving to the gym. Once this habit was established, he could improve it by staying at the gym longer. This method helped him lose 100 pounds.

> It's James’ 2-Minute rule. Scale your habit down and do it for two minutes and then stop. The two minutes becomes a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. If we make it easier, the rest will follow.

## Reflections on showing up and doing your best

I think it was a time during university where I did a business case competition. What happened is that my friend said I was overly critical, so I should put my money where my mouth is, by trying a business case competition.

I had never done it before, so I was assigned to a random team of three other strangers. As the time went by, all three of them dropped out, and it was just me by myself. I had the choice, and I could have been lazy about it, but I thought, if I go out and do my best in the case competition, then at least I'll know where I'll stand, you know, and that's the only way to really improve.

So I really committed myself and spent a lot of time and effort on doing the case comp at [[University of Waterloo|uWaterloo]], and learning the best I could from my friends and mentors. I ended up getting first place, and that was a big boost in my confidence. It's something I hold as a big growth opportunity for my self-esteem, because I knew I could achieve stuff if I simply tried. I came in first place and I feel like it was a [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|defining moment in my life]] to further engage my interest in business.
