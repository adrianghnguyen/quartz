# My personal project management process

#status/done

## What kind of information do i want to record as part of my project planning process?

- Basic historical and logistical information
- Planned challenges and difficulties (project risk factors) so I can begin thinking ahead
- Who can I talk to to get help? What resources are available?
- My ideal learning outcomes
	- Why do I want to do this project? Sometimes, because it's funny is a good enough reason
	- What am I hoping to learn from it?
- Project post-mortem - turn this into its own checklist to incorporate into each page?
	- What did I learn? What was challenging?

## Core workflow principles

Inspired from Agile work philosophies.

- Keep it minimal and streamlined.
- Reduce friction where possible with the help of tools, automation and templates
- Keep core knowledge within Obsidian as much as possible as it is my second brain
- Avoid distractions and dedicate time to focus on project work even when life gets busy
	- Maybe look at [[Deep Work by Cal Newport]]
	- [[Remove distractions through minimalism]]
- Projects are meant to be fun
	- it shouldn't become [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]] driven ([[Shame and guilt are inherited]]) where I feel like I am failing if I can't dedicate the right amount of time.

## Tools used

### Obsidian

- Good for recording information and knowledge. Most information should live here including overall metadata
- Not the best tool for doing actual project tracking ([[A professional's mentality]])

## Potential skeleton workflow

1. Insert brain dumped ideas within Obsidian ([[Interesting Project Ideas]])
	1. Can use the QuickAdd plugin to rapidly capture time and date I had the idea
2. Create one-liner which links to Obsidian project template ([[_Template - Project Template]]) page
	1. Fill out basic information such as scope, learning outcomes and challenges plus mitigation plans
	2. Project status is recorded within YAML and as a tag
3. Projects which are selected for work will get created within Jira using a *basic summary name*
	1. Record project key and project URL within my PKM ([[Why I write in Obsidian]])
4. Break project down into actionable steps via tasks and sub-tasks
5. Record project notes within Obsidian
6. Once completed, do post-mortem on *project report page* within Obsidian
