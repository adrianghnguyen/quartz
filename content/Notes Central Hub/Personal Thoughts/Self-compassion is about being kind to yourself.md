There are three main ways to increase our self-compassion:
- Practice self-kindness by [[Dealing with our inner critic|choosing a kinder inner voice]].
	- It is the opposite to self-judgement.
	- Don't say to yourself what you would not say to a loved one going through a hard time.
	- [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|Let the voice of your ego flow by]].
- Learning to recognize [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common humanity]] and that we are not [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|not alone]] in our feelings
- [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|Accepting our feelings by being non-judgmental]] and take a balanced view of the situation rather than [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|overidentifying with failure]] and [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional distress]].
	- It can be good to avoid [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|catastrophizing]] and feeling like it is the end of the world.

> [!note]- Self-compassion from [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]
> In her book _Self-Compassion: Stop Beating Yourself Up and Leave Insecurity Behind_, researcher and educator Kristin Neff describes self-compassion’s three key elements:
>
> • **Self-kindness** is our ability to treat ourselves gently and with caring. On the Self Compassion Scale (SCS), a survey used to assess self-compassion, self-kindness is described with items like “When I’m going through a very hard time, I give myself the caring and tenderness I need.” In contrast, its opposite, self-judgment, is assessed with “I’m intolerant and impatient towards those aspects of my personality I don’t like.”
>
> • **[[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|Common humanity]]** is viewing our suffering as something that connects us with others, rather than separates us. It’s assessed on the SCS with items like “When I feel inadequate in some way, I try to remind myself that feelings of inadequacy are shared by most people.” Its opposite, [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|isolation]], is assessed with “When I fail at something that’s important to me, I tend to feel alone in my failure.”
>
> • **Mindfulness** is being [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|nonjudgmental]] about whatever is happening in the present moment. Neff talked about mindfulness in chapter 4, and it will be discussed again in chapter 9. Mindfulness is important. On the SCS it’s assessed with items like “When something painful happens I try to take a balanced view of the situation.” Its opposite is over-identification, as in over-identifying with your own failures and suffering, holding fast to the pain and being unable to let it go. It’s assessed with items like “When I’m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that’s wrong.”
>
> Self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification turn you into your own lion, being your own threat—“I am at risk.” And they’re normal—we all experience them. Self-compassion doesn’t mean never feeling them, it means being kind to yourself when you do.

It's understandable to have feelings of  [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame and guilt]]. We can practice self-compassion through [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|forgiving ourselves for mistakes]] and learning to [[Emotion coaching is accepting all feelings and working through them|accepting our emotions]] with an [[Nonjudgmental attitude is the ability to withhold judgment and biases|attitude of non-judgment]]. Don't forget about [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|the Hope Circuit]] to fight feelings of pessimism and loneliness.

## Self-compassion is not self-esteem, self-pity or indulgence

See also: [What Self-Compassion is Not: self-esteem, self-pity, indulgence](https://self-compassion.org/what-self-compassion-is-not-2/)

- Self compassion is different from [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]].
	- Self-esteem is about self-evaluation and how you perceive yourself and [[Life significance is having an appreciation for how our life has inherent value|your worth as a human being]], which depends on your level of personal success and [[Social comparison|how you compare your status to other people]].
- Self-compassion is different from [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|self-indulgence]] and is not necessary for motivation
- It's learning to [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|sit with our feelings]] and complete the [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response cycle]].
## Building self-compassion

### Validate your own personal suffering

We're only privy to our inner thoughts and turmoil - only our anguish can seem insurmountable once it is buried within. Isn't it interesting how we treat others others more kindly than ourselves at times. Perhaps because we only know the true depths of our horrible nightmares, our worst behaviours.

We wish to detach ourselves from this [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|self-image]] so we berate ourselves [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|wishing to be better]]. An [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|endless spiral of self-loathing]] which drags us to the darkest places within one's corner of the mind. Because if others saw how vile our inner world was, perhaps we would feel [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|undeserving of love]], to be accepted by others and so we distance ourselves.

Even here today, I find myself intellectualizing my thoughts to create psychological distance. How difficult would be to say, today I feel unlovable for the many ways I have fallen apart and crumbled. But the day rages on, a [[Sleep is important|good night's sleep]] washes it all away.

### Accept your past

Although regret can be [[Use powerful emotions towards constructive ends|constructive for self-improvement]], [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|excessive self hatred is not very useful as motivation.]]

- [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|forgiving our mistakes]]
- [[Forgive yourself for past traumas]]
- We all have [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]] and it is not a [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|unique human experience]]

[[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|Practice positive self-talk to create a kinder inner voice.]]

### Nurture self-compassion when feeling stuck

Laziness differs from standing still - such as the feeling of [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological impasse]]. We expend much energy in this [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] and [[Self-confidence|self-doubt]] an inability to move through the feeling of impasse. We may imagine that we only have but insurmountable mountains to climb - to aggrandize our challenges into impossible tasks in such a way that we [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|begin to lose hope]].

And when we fail to complete these tasks, the [[Dealing with our inner critic|inner critic]] may self-identify us as being lazy, or not working hard enough - something echoed by the [[Little monitors seek to resolve worldly discrepancies|little monitors]] from our [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one Emotional Ring]].

[[We avoid authentic pursuits due to personal fears]]

## Reflections on the nature of self-love

I am starting to understand why society in general praises self-love. As humans, to be loved is to be understood. To be told 'I see you'.

Who else can understand you as well as you can yourself? Only you are privy to your inner thoughts, positive and negative - good ones and bad.

This ties into [[Emotional vulnerability is the willingness and ability to express true emotions|emotional vulnerability]]. The reason why it is scary is because it means exposing this side to others - where it may be criticized, attacked or ridiculed as explained within [[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown]].

If our bar of understanding is that of self love's, then it makes sense that none can rise up to this [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|unrealistic expectation]]. A factor amplified by things like [[Mental illness|poor mental health]] and past [[Traumatic experiences are a result of ignoring stress responses|traumatic experiences]]. Remember that our brains tend to have a [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] which is the result of a mismatch in expectations.

[[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|Disliking yourself is self-hatred]] and is the opposite of self-love. When we [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|learn to accept ourselves]], we can tap into a greater sense of community and [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|feelings of belonging]] because we feel worthy as a person, leading to a sense of [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]].

>  Don't say to yourself what you would not say to your best friend or a little child.

Our [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|inner voice]] can sometimes be cruel - [[Dealing with our inner critic|an endless inner critic]]. It can be overcome through practicing [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]] or simply practicing [[Building resilience requires self-acceptance|acceptance of the self]].
