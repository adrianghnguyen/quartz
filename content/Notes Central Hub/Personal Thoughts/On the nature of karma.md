It's funny, I went on LinkedIn and saw a high conflict friend %%Julia Nguyen%% I lost contact with. Perhaps for the better. She lost her job. I'm not sure if I am being too harsh but I believe that karma exists.

To clarify - karma is the external reflection of our conscious and unconscious behavior. She thinks the world is out to get her, understandably so due to her trauma and likewise she reinforces her thought patterns concerning that, looking for conflict where they may not be. Where there is smoke - there is fire. Likewise, I choose to be an [[Optimism is needed for long-term success|optimist]] and act with goodwill towards the world.

Even though life has not been easy so far, and I myself have received poor karma at times, it has led me to my current journey. These days, I choose to be pragmatic and and [[Optimism is needed for long-term success|optimist]] as part of [[My core values define what matters|my values]] to guide my worldview([[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse]]). I have been blessed to have excellent friends ([[The zen of the accountabilabuddy]]).

Stepping back into [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] has been quite beneficial in understanding that the world may not be out to get me ([[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego]]). Be kind - we only have each other in this world ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]).
