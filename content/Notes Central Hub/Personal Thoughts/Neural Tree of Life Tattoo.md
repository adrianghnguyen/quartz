# Neural tree of life tattoo

#status/done

Related to [[Tattoo ideas]]

As of [[2023-02-13 Mon]], I think I like @tattooist_yuca the most for this concept [[Tattoo ideas#Artists Shortlist and Inspiration]]

## Primary tattoo design details

I would like a tree of life, whose roots resemble a [[Neural Network|neural network]]. The trunk should incorporate the vertical characters from Hwaa (火花) as a design.

> [!warning] Double/triple-check the calligraphy of hwaa (火花)
> Please - before we mess up very badly. Ask friends lol.
> It should mean flower but may have other meanings as well.

### Summary of design details

- Tree of life
	- Trunk should incorporate characters for hwaa 火花
	- Tree branches could include [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]]'s handwriting provided by [[Co Ti - Bo Hien|paternal aunt (Co Ti)]]
- Tree root network which look like synaptic network/[[Neural Network]]
- Possibly peonies as branch flowers - may be too much though

## Personal meaning of the tattoo

### Korean culture as represented by the song hwaa (火花)

The song Hwaa (火花) by (G)I-DLE is described as:

> The feelings after a breakup with the ambiguous subject of _hwa (화)_. The song sings about the pain of love using the burning fire and colourful flowers in the cold winter sensibility as a metaphor.

#### Interpreting the song's title

1. Hwaa (written: 화) in Korean means anger/rage
2. 火花 (pronounced: Huǒhuā) in Mandarin means spark in other words the 'burning fire' returning after the cold winter of love
3. 花 (pronounced: Huā), the second Chinese character of the compound title in Mandarin means flower which also shares the pronunciation in Vietnamese

#### Significance of korean culture in my life

The tattoo's first meaning is the **significance of Korean culture in my life**. My first crush was Korean girl who inspired me to listen to k-pop ([[My hobbies and favorite activities]]) and StarCraft ([[My love letter to StarCraft]]) which in turn led me to my business mindset. The beautiful music ([[The experience of listening to music]]) always bring a well of emotions - sadness, joy, happiness, etc.  Its dances has brought me so much joy ([[Nuggets of happiness]]) including how to reconnect with my body ([[Mind-body connection]]).

Since the song is also about the **pain of love using the burning fire** and colourful flowers (Hua - 花) in the cold winter sensibility as a metaphor." I've always been someone who is [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|extremely sensitive]]and I feel like my burning love lingers for long even after having parted with my  previous partners.  This yearning and complicated feeling is something represented well within Hwaa. I now realize that it's important to let go of [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|attachment]].

### Trees represent the living and the ones gone

The tree of life would express my deep [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] for my [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|father]] ([[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss]]) and how important is it to move forward ([[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments]]) experiencing life fully.

### Mycorrhizal networks demonstrate the nature of interconnectivity in life

Additionally, I truly believe that everything in life is [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|connected]]  The joy of living is to [[Happiness requires action|intentionally build out]]  connections to ideas, people and the universe.

[[Mycorrhizal Network|Trees and their roots]] are part of a bigger ecosystem just as we are all connected through society, and shared [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values]].

### Roots resemble synaptic networks

The tree's roots can also symbolize [[Neuroplasticity|synaptic networks]] representing my belief that anything can become a habit through enough [[Neuroplasticity|reinforcement]]. This naturally extends to my pursuit of [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|mastery]] through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]].

It also represents my love of psychology (it was my undergrad after all) and neuroscience. It  has influenced how I approach life. Our brains are the [[Mind-body connection|final interpretive layer of information]] for our worldly interactions

## Inspiration

- Flower
- [(여자)아이들((G)I-DLE) - '화(火花)(HWAA)' Official Music Video - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3szNvgQxHo)

> As for the chrysanthemum, it is not only the monopoly of the Autumn but also the symbol of serenity and the indifference of people to honors and glory. Analogous to the flower of plum tree, the **magnolia** is the symbol of feminine beauty. It often designates a young girl in poetical compositions.
>
> Although the **peony** is seen as a noble flower, it does not have a significant range than it continues to have in China. Probably because of the Chinese influence, one continues to keep that custom. The **peony is often evoked in Vietnamese ornamental art or in legends** (The story of the mandarin Từ Thức and the fairy Giáng Hương for example)

I think I prefer peonies?

### Hwaa

- "**Hwaa**" ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language "Korean language"): 화(火花); lit. "Anger (Spark)"
- "Hwaa" **refers to a flower, and represents spring and love**. It uses two different Chinese characters with one meaning 'fire' (火) and the other 'flower' (花)
