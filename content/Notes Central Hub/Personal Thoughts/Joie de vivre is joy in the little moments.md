# Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments

I was also reflecting on what joie de vivre is and how others observe that within me.  It was sparked by a comment that [[Rachel Cao]] had made that one of the traits she admires within me is that I have a certain life energy and genuine excitement to engage with daily life.

Everyday is an [[View challenges as opportunities|opportunity]] to learn and [[Curiosity as my worldview|experience something new]].

When we go for a walk and see something funny, we are engaging with the universe. When we link two ideas together, we develop a [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|deeper appreciation for things]].  [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|No one can survive alone]] and experiencing the joy of connections is felt deep to one's core. When one is able to adopt this as a fundamental truth, they are able to let go of their [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]], allowing one to develop true [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]].

After thinking about my dancing at [[2023-01-28|Worakl's and KPOP club night]], I realize that to be alive is to be [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|truly grounded in the present]] with no care for the world - no sense of shame. It's to [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|live as you want to]]. I live intensely moment to moment because I understand [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|mortality]], the accompanying [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] and want to fully enjoy the moment.

I want to live for me and my [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|father]] who passed away - to live like he would and have joy for the both of us.

> I'm going to love and make joy - enough for the both of us.
