## What is the Fediverse?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The Fediverse is a decentralized network of social media platforms that are interconnected through the use of open-source software protocols. It allows users to interact with each other across different platforms while maintaining control over their data and privacy.
>
> Instead of relying on centralized servers, the Fediverse is built on a network of individual servers, or "instances," run by different individuals or organizations. Each instance can have its own rules and policies, creating diverse communities and allowing users to choose the environment that best suits their needs.
>
> Some popular platforms in the Fediverse include Mastodon (a microblogging platform), PeerTube (a video hosting platform), and Pixelfed (an image sharing platform).
>
> These platforms can communicate with each other through protocols like ActivityPub and OStatus, allowing for seamless communication between users on different instances.
>
> The Fediverse offers an alternative to traditional social media platforms that are often criticized for their centralized control over user data and content moderation policies. With the Fediverse, users can participate in a decentralized network where they have more control over their online presence.

## Transitioning from Reddit to Lemmy

Reddit seems to be having a complete meltdown, which is similar to what happened to Digg many years ago.

As a result, some people have started moving their stuff more to the Fediverse, and Lemmy is one of the upcoming communities.

I am somewhat of an early adopter, so I'm trying out the technology, and it's a very interesting thing to see a grassroots movement taking place. Obviously, the level of activity and maturity is not where Reddit is, because it's had many more years of growth. But maybe that's a good thing in order to reduce my [[Social media epidemic contributes to the mental health crisis|social media dependency]].
