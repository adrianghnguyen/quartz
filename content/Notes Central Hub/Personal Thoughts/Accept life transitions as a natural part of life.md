## Life transitions are the in-between periods of major life changes

[[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is often unpredictable]] and does not always unfold the way we hope. New experiences, whether they be expected or unexpected tend to interrupt the predictable cycles of our lives. These inflections points are called transitions and they are part of the [[Understanding the complexity of life|natural cycle of life]]. They may leave us [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|feeling stuck]] and reflecting on our sense of identity between past and future.

Oftentimes, life transitions are positive and desired experiences such as [[Examples of life transitions|graduating from school or learning to become a parent]]. At other times, they may be undesired or unexpected such as losing a job or falling ill to a disease. 

When life transitions are made with [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal agency]], people often wish they did it at [[Minimizing future regret to make choices#Most people regret not making big life decisions earlier|earlier rather than later]] - even if life transitions can be painful at times.

It can be more fruitful to practice a [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|mindset of stoic acceptance when it comes to life]].

## Major life changes occur often - every 12 to 18 months

For most of us, we will experience the state of being in transition every 12-18 months according to [[Research work on life transitions|research on life transitions]] from Bruce Feiler. We are in this state more often than we think, and most of the time is it borne out of our own choices.

Major life transitions which involve [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|significant decisions in life]], according to Bruce Feiler, will occur between 3 to 5 times in our lives. They may be a result of personal moments which are happy and joyful such as having a child, getting married while others are involuntary or unwelcome, such as unemployment or life-threatening illnesses.

Huge collective transitions, and cataclysmic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic would also count or things like WWII if one was born during a prior generation. We simply can't expect everything to go  [[Making decisions for the future can be challenging|perfectly according to plan]]

While talking with my friend %%[[Rebecca Chong|Rebecca Chong]]%% she mentioned that maybe all our lives are all chaotic, we just choose to be selective in what we desire to share in order to maintain our sense of image. It can be a reminder that difficult parts in life are a [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common human experience]].

See [[Examples of life transitions]]

### Things typically work themselves out

According to Robert Feiler, 90% of people spoke favourably of their prior transition and view it as success once they feel like life has stabilized again and they have found solid ground as a result of the [[Fading affect bias explains how people perceive events in their lives to more often be pleasant than unpleasant|fading affect bias]]. It's a [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common human experience]].

It can pay off to [[Being patient leads to better decisions|be patient with myself]] as I navigate [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|difficult feelings]]. That's why it can payoff to follow a [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|regret minimization framework]] and just do the harder decisions now rather than putting it off until later - procrastinating. This applies to [[Examples of life transitions|common life situations]]

## Life transitions lead to personal change and growth

Whether they are positive or negative, transitions create a lot of change in our lives. We learn to take on new identities, new titles, learn new ways of doing things, and force ourselves to adapt or fail. Otherwise, we risk feeling like we are [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|getting left behind in life]].

Transitional periods in life are when we feel *in-between* such moments of predictability which can disrupt our emotional balance. Social scientists call this being in a [[Liminal state are transitional states|liminal state]].

Oftentimes we experience emotions such as [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|shame]] or regret when [[Examples of life transitions|transitions]] are undesired or unexpected - and [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|can cause us a lot of stress]] - but it can also provides opportunities for [[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|post-traumatic growth]].

Once I've been dealt my cards, I can choose to make the [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|most of my fate]] by seeking to [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|pick a path which will minimize regret]].

### Accept that difficult life transitions provide us meaning

Understanding life transitions properly can help us curb our tendency to fight the current and help us [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|shift mindset]] to make these periods of transition into a [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|source of meaning]] and transcendence.

Additionally, difficult and painful life transitions can yield greater [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|understanding for our lives' purpose]].

> [[REF Some key differences between a happy life and a meaningful life|Research]] on how people derive a sense of purpose has found that while [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|periods of pain]] and struggle make us temporarily unhappy, they also make us feel as if our lives have more meaning.

It's a message also shared by [[Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl|Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl]].

> One of the things we learn by not resisting challenging transitions is how to cope with subsequent life changes. In his book Meanings of Life, the psychologist Roy F. Baumeister argues that a sense of meaning gained through change makes the rest of life seem more stable.

> This is one of the great consolations of aging and seeing a lot of change—transitions likely don’t cause as much distress.

### Difficult periods stimulate innovation and ingenuity

> Difficult periods can also stimulate innovation and ingenuity. A large amount of literature talks about “[[Post-traumatic growth is overcoming difficult moments|post-traumatic growth]],” in which people derive long-term benefits from painful experiences, including more appreciation for life, richer relationships, greater [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|resilience]], and deeper spirituality. Another manifestation of this growth, according to some newer scholarship^[ [Perceiving benefits after adversity: The relationship between self-reported posttraumatic growth and creativity.](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-04171-001)], is [[Theories of creativity and motivation|heightened creativity]].

Life transitions are often difficult experiences in our lives, and most of the time they are chosen. Transitions are an [[Understanding the complexity of life|integral part of life]] with them typically occurring between every 12-18 months on average.

Transitions often provoke an identity crisis and ask ourselves who are we are and give us a [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|feeling stuck between past and the future]]. It may cause us to start [[Discover your personal values through reflection|questioning our values]]. Difficult transitions can lead us to a greater [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|sense of understanding]], [[Theories of creativity and motivation|creativity]]. [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|Practicing acceptance and leaning into transitions]] is the key to make them less distressing and maximizing their benefits of [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]], opportunity for self-reflection and process our emotions.

Most of us will make it out okay. I think back on my decision to [[My career reflections and planning|quitting Unity]] or sometimes it is imposed upon us, such as the death of an important loved one, such as the [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|loss of my father]]. It will ultimately lead to positive outcomes and a greater [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|appreciation for life]].

I guess it can be one way of examining the period of break in my life where I decided to resign from work and my thoughts during that [[My career reflections and planning|My career reflections and planning]]. We can [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|choose to embrace fate]].
