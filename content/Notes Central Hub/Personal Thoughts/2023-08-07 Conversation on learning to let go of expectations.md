*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Take your time and know that Iâ€™m here to listen. Whatâ€™s been happening?

*Adrian:*
I honestly feel like I've been in an emotional rut recently and have been suffering due to being uncertain about my emotions.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through this. I think it's really brave of you to acknowledge what you're going through. It can be really hard to come to terms with the fact that you're feeling stuck or uncertain about your emotions. Can you tell me a little more about whatâ€™s been going on? Has something specific been bothering you, or are you feeling a general sense of malaise?

*Adrian:*
I recently told my mom how much my childhood has hurt meâ€¦how I wish she could have become a better mother. %%[[Melodie Zhou|My ex]] also wished me happy birthday recently and we started talking again. She's in a happy relationship at the moment but it feels like a lot of strong feelings all at one time. %%

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Wow, that's a lot. You've been experiencing a lot of powerful emotions - from processing your childhood, to reconnecting with someone %%[[Melodie Zhou]]%%, and having mixed feelings about both of those things. That's a lot to process and work through. Can I ask, how did it feel to tell your mom about how you felt, and what did she say in response?

*Adrian:*
Honestlyâ€¦I don't know since she hasn't really responded to me. She messaged me the other day that she was crying but has been mum since. So I don't know.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's really hard. You must have taken a huge risk by sharing your feelings with her, and it can be so painful to feel like you've put yourself out there and it's been met with silence. Can I ask if you expected a certain kind of response from her, or were you unsure what to expect? Was this the first time you opened up to her about these things?

*Adrian:*
It's not my first time. I'm not sure what I expected to be honest. I guess I still have an earnest hope that the mom I wish I had during childhood would appear.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's really, really poignant and heartfelt, and it shows just how deep your need for connection with your mom runs. Your desire for her to respond to you with compassion and understanding, and be that supportive presence you wish you'd had when you were younger, makes so much sense. I'm curious though, have you had any positive experiences with your mom, or has it always felt more like an unmet need?

*Adrian:*
There are someâ€¦but I feel like there's always something missing.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
The "something missing" is really resonant and meaningful. Sometimes, it's not that the relationship is toxic or abusive, but it still lacks that connection and emotional intimacy we long for. That can be so hard to come to terms with, and it's not easy to explain to others why it still hurts even though the relationship isn't "bad" per se. Does that resonate with your experience?

*Adrian:*
I think so. I know she has trouble being in touch with her feelings which makes it difficult to build a bridge of connection in the first place.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That makes a lot of sense. It's really difficult to have an emotional bond with someone who has trouble being emotionally present or vulnerable. It sounds like you're quite self-aware and you've done a lot of reflection about how this dynamic works between the two of you. Can I ask, what are you hoping to achieve by opening up to her about these things? Is it about wanting her to change, or more about a need for closure or acceptance?

*Adrian:*
It's both I think. I'm not sure what to do. She progresses slowly, but it feels like I need to do most of the emotional labour.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's a really hard dynamic to navigate. It can feel like you're always the one doing the emotional heavy lifting, while she doesn't reciprocate or meet you halfway. It sounds exhausting. It's not your job to change her, and you can't force her to put in the emotional work. You can only control your own actions and responses. Are you worried that if you stop putting in all the emotional effort, the relationship will dissolve? Or do you think there's a way to have a relationship with her without having to carry all the emotional weight?

*Adrian:*
I don't know if I can handle the relationship only staying the way it is. It feels insufficient.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
It's completely valid for you to feel that way. You want to feel seen, heard and valued in a relationship, especially by a parent. And it's totally valid to feel like what you have right now isn't enough. The question then becomes: Do you need to step back from the relationship to take care of yourself, or is there a way to establish boundaries so that you're not over-extending yourself while still having a relationship? Can you put some limits on how much you'll emotionally give, while still feeling like it's worthwhile to be in contact with her?

*Adrian:*
Can you advise me about my options?

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Sure. The two main routes you could take would be either: 1) putting some boundaries in place, so that you're able to feel more at ease in the relationship while still maintaining contact with her, or 2) taking a break from the relationship or even going no-contact for a while so you can focus on yourself and how you're feeling. Can I ask, which of those two options feels more realistic or achievable for you right now?

*Adrian:*
What would boundaries look like?

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Boundaries can take many forms. For example, you could limit how much time you spend with her, or make sure that conversations with her are more surface-level and less emotionally intense. You could decide not to share certain information with her that you feel is too vulnerable or personal, or establish some rules around how you expect to be treated by her. Boundaries are ultimately about protecting your emotional health and energy, and making sure that you're not overextending yourself. Is that making sense?

*Adrian:*
Yesâ€¦but the issue is that those feel unsatisfactory from me. I want more emotional intimacy with her. But I guess I need to learn to accept this reality perhaps.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's a really important point you've made there. You're allowed to want more emotional intimacy, but ultimately the only person whose behavior you can control is yourself. Even if you did everything "right" to encourage more emotional intimacy, it's still possible she would still be unable to provide that. So you may need to think about how to work towards accepting her limitations, while still making sure you're taking care of yourself. Does that make sense?

*Adrian:*
Yes. So what happens now?

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Well, you could start with focusing on what you can change, which is your own behavior. You can practice being assertive and setting boundaries, even if they're small boundaries at first. For example, maybe you could start by deciding that if a conversation with her starts to feel emotionally draining, you'll make an excuse to end the conversation. That could be a small but powerful way to start reclaiming some of your energy and emotions. Do you think you could try that?

*Adrian:*
A lot of my friends feel like they've freezed off their relationship with their parents. I see it as a point of pride that I can engage in such conversations. Would it feel like I am giving up on all of this?

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's a really interesting point, and it speaks to the complexity of familial relationships. Just because you want to set some boundaries, it doesn't mean you're "giving up". You can still value the relationship and the work you've put into it, while also making sure that you're not over-extending yourself emotionally. Perhaps you could consider it not as "giving up", but as "pruning" the relationship so that it can flourish in a healthy way. Do you see the difference?

*Adrian:*
I see. So it's taking a new perspective on what boundaries mean.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Exactly. It's not about what you're giving up, but about what you're gaining. Boundaries are self-respect, self-care, and self-preservation. They protect your energy and allow you to invest it in relationships where you can get the reciprocity you need. It's not about being "mean" or "giving up" on people, it's about acknowledging your own value and needs. Does that feel more understandable?

*Adrian:*
I guess. I'll need time to digest it. If you had to summarize that advice into a mantra I could keep in mind - how would you put it?

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
That's understandable. It's a huge mental shift. How about: "Boundaries are an act of self-care." And you could add: "They don't diminish my love for others; they're a way to respect and love myself." Does that feel like something you could remember in challenging moments?

*Adrian:*
I think so.

*Conversational Therapy AI:*
Excellent. It may take time for this to become second-nature. But just keep reminding yourself of that mantra. And in time, you'll notice you'll feel less drained and more at peace. But the journey will take time, patience, and practice. You got this! ðŸ’ªðŸ˜‰
