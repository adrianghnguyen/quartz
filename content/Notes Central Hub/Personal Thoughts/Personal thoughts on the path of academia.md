# Personal thoughts on the path of academia

#status/done

I've had multiple people ([[Poe Han Thar Kyaw]], [[Scott Seymour]], [[Dominique Clement]], [[Rachel Cao]]) in my lives, when presented as to [[Why I write in Obsidian|why I write in Obsidian]], telling me that I should consider a research career or at least evaluate the option. I have to admit, I have a bit of internal resistance to it. As of [[2023-02-28 Tue|now]], I'm thinking of [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] with its emphasis of using interdisciplinary knowledge to understand human [[General Intelligence Factor|intelligence]] to be quite interesting.

For one, I want the ability to apply my knowledge. Being stuck in a lab, being forced to pursue specific decision paths set by my supervisor doesn't sound very appealing to me. But what job is not fraught with needing to appeal to a higher power (kinda like religion eh?). Even if I worked within the industry, I would have a manager or at least some variation of a stakeholder.

At least within industry, I would have the opportunity to get paid more…hopefully. As well as applying what I know towards a specific product or use. I believe that living in the complete theoretical is not for me. When thinking of my [[Career Psychology Survey Results|career survey]] results, doing hands-on work is important to me. Does this apply even if I do something similar to programming which is…digital in nature? I'm not sure.

But why is money important to me? Because I believe that it buys you autonomy or rather control, part of the [[Traits defining great work|traits that define great work]]. Money in itself is only a means to an end. I was lucky enough to be brought up in a household which did not lack financial resources thanks to [[Tran Huynh|my mom's]] hard work.

With that, I was able to obtain a [[Fixed mindset|growth mindset]] where my first instinct when faced with a challenge ([[View challenges as opportunities]]) is to ask the question - how will I achieve this, rather than coming up with reasons or excuses why it is not possible. I will find a way - I just need to determine the right strategy. That perhaps means needing to elongate the timeline, or sidetrack ([[Success requires time and patience]]) but I believe in my [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]].

Going back to the central point, I guess it's important to keep gathering information - remember [[OODA Loop|Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA)]]. I have friends to probe. Schools to research. Projects to seek to accomplish. Every little thing allows me to hone in on my instinct and know in my gut feeling what will be right.

Let's live true to Adrian yeah ? [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|Authenticity is the Harmony between Behaviours and Values]].
