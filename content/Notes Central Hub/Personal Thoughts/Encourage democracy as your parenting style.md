# Encourage democracy as your parenting style

#status/done

> [!NOTE] Authoritative as a word choice
> In French, this parenting style is described as *democratic* which I believe is a better descriptor.

> A parenting style is a psychological construct representing standard strategies that parents use in their child rearing. The quality of parenting can be more essential than the quantity of time spent with the child.^[Wikipedia]

In this style:
> The parent is **demanding** and **responsive**. When this style is systematically developed, it grows to fit the descriptions **propagative parenting**, **democratic parenting**, **positive parenting** and **[concerted cultivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concerted_cultivation "Concerted cultivation")**.
>
> Authoritative parents **are not** usually as controlling as authoritarian parents, allowing the child to explore more freely, thus having them make their own decisions based upon their own reasoning. Often, authoritative parents produce children who are more independent and self-reliant (related to [[How to best raise a potentially gifted child]]).
