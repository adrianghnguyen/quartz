## Personal reflections

> [!NOTE] My thoughts during the AlphaGo documentary
> [AlphaGo - The Movie | Full award-winning documentary - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)

I want to discover things that humanity doesn't understand. To work with people smarter than me who make me look like a huge idiot.

Watching Alpha go is like watching the rocket launches. To build something that even us humans can't understand is the closest thing I believe to in God.

Them working with [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] is like giving birth to a child. I think there's something incredible to give birth to something you don't understand, to watch it learn and grow

To see something creative. Why create art… Because we want to reproduce… To give birth to something that is more than us? Is that what AI is to me?

AlphaGo is a network. Everything is connected.

To go into the unknown is terrifying… But it's what I want to explore. Fear.

I'm trying really hard to see the themes and the [[Multiple discovery of solutions|point of convergence]]. I know I won't get there over night, but I'd like to know the direction to go in. Everything is connected and brings additional knowledge into my life. I just have to sort out the noise and begin walking. Exploring is fun but scary
