# The value of good enough

See also [[Aiming for satisfactory or adequate results|satisficing]].

There is tremendous value in 'good enough'. My work is good enough. I am a good enough person. 

It weighs heavy on the mind, a burden on the shoulders. Little did I know how much it would drag me down. It's something I noticed in terms of psychological weight during my [[Psilocybin|psychedelic experience]] on [[2023-12-13|Wednesday December 13th 2023]].

There's inertia…a weight. Driven by [[perfectionism]], I feel immobilized and frozen. There are countless options, which to take. Which one is right? Frozen with [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]].

But good enough is the mantra for the day. Good enough means that taking action over the right action is acceptable. It means that I am human. To accept that I will [[Dealing with weakness|make mistakes]], and that it does not make me of a lesser, a [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure]].

To recognize and have pride in knowing that I did something to move forward, that's something for which I can [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|be grateful]], a lesson learned from the [[Non-zero day mindset|non-zero day mindset]]. Today's victory may be smaller than the previous one. And the future's may be greater than that of today's.

But something is better than nothing. It's also recognizing that there is I have free agency, I don't need to feel burdened by how others may feel. They are entitled to their reactions…but I am entitled to my own world. So I should establish [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|healthy boundaries]] to assert my own needs accordingly.

I will learn to better recognize which are my true needs versus that of an exterior voice. I need to tell myself that I can make choices because I simply wish to do so. Because it's what I want and my heart desires, free of external taint.

Because to say, I think it would be fun would be good enough. I've lived a long life, shackled by external expectations. To be the good boy. To be calm. To follow expected rules of decorum and live a principled life. Lessons to be taken of course, but from there, the free will and adventurous spirit was led to a grave.

Is there a healthier balance which I can hold? What are the things I wish to keep? To live authentically, I must be willing to do it [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|regardless of outcome]]. I am a pragmatic person, and I am well-reasoned. So perhaps [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|excessive self-criticism]] and an overindex of self-doubt is unnecessary to my decisions.

I need to trust my actions to be reasonable yet the voice of guilt lives and places weights on my shoulders.

Perhaps in terms of algorithms I can think of it this way:
- [[Breathe slowly and take a deep breath|Take a deep breath]]
- What is my overall objective?
- Can it have a significant impact on my life? ie. health, money, career, social standing? I need to be realistic and think if it really is a high stake situation or not. Most of the time, it is not.
- If not, then going with a [[Aiming for satisfactory or adequate results|good enough solution]] is adequate.

It's also recognizing the importance of play and rest. My mind has been thinking and working through a potential career plan. It's important to think these things through - have I gone overboard? I feel like that's bit of [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|self-criticism]] rather than recognizing that I wanted to really understand the problem.

But I can also [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|tell myself]] that it's probably [[Obsessive passion means neglecting other important things in life|healthy to take a step back]] and enjoy the rest of life. And giving myself permission to play, to have fun and enjoy life will allow me to do better work as well.

When is the last time I gave myself permission to play?
