# Trust is earned or lost through actions

Related to [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust]]

Trust is something which is earned through actions, destroyed or lost. It can also lead to a deepening of a relationship through emotional disclosures such as sharing information, leading to [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerability]].

It is not something which is fixed and can vary as we adapt our responses and how we perceive the status of the relationship with the other person. [[Create trust in order to build an emotional connection|Trust is required to build an emotional connection.]]

Some of us think that people are trustworthy or not - there is [[Black or white-thinking|no in-between]] but perhaps a more measured and nuanced approach to trust is warranted.
## Marble jar analogy of trust

Brené Brown asked her child to remember the story of the teacher's marble jar in [[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown]].

Her child who was in early years of school came back in tears. She had said a secret to one of her [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|best friends]] in utmost confidence yet this was betrayed when her friend told her little secret to others. At first, Brene's instinct as a mother was to tell her child "The world is cruel and we need to defend ourselves. It's okay to wish to withdraw in a cocoon." Her child wanted nothing to do more with that friend and said she will never learn to trust others.

But as a researcher in shame, she wanted to [[lead by example|provide the right example]] to her child. She explained to her the marble jar analogy of trust.

It goes like so in her retelling:

> There is a marble jar in the classroom. When the class does something good, they earn a few marble jars. When they do something bad, they lose a few. However, depending on the action, they might gain a few, or many marble jars. It is not a fixed amount.
>
> How can you know when to trust someone? When they do something which says "I am important and likes me", they earn a few marbles. When they do something like "this hurt me, or this did not sit right with my [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|feelings]]" they lose a few marbles.
>
> Perhaps this friend does not deserve your marbles of trust - but can you think of other people who you would give a few marbles to? Her child replied enthusiastically "Yeah I have X friend and Y friend who make me feel good and tell me how important I am to them!".
>
> So Brené reminded her child that there are some people who are more worthy of our trust, and others who perhaps have less through their actions. But it is not black or white, or all-or-nothing.

Practicing [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|emotional vulnerability]]  requires us to exercise careful judgement and [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] to determine who is worthy of our trust. Learning to [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|pick the right people]] is what leads us to live a full and rich live.

## The money test for measuring the trust of a friendship

My friend %% [[Brian Huang]] %% said that one can judge the quality of your [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|friendship]] through a simple test:

> [!NOTE] Asking for money - what is your primary concern?
>
> If a friend came up to you and ask for money, where would you concern lie? Where your mind goes next tells you how you think of the strength of the relationship.
>
> 1. Will they repay me?
> 2. Why do they need money and are they okay?

We should opt for [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|friends]] for whom we have genuine concern and care - those who take up little shares of our mind space are perhaps not worth investing further time and effort. It's also a [[Trust is fluid|matter of trusting the other person]].
