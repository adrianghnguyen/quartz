It's important to not [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|overidentify with failure]] - it can keep us trapped in this [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|personal narrative]]. [[Failure is never definitive|Failure is never definitive.]] I feel like I experience a lot of [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|shameful emotions]] and personal self-doubt when I encouter roadblocks and challenges in life. There are some lessons to take in terms of developing [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]].

It's improtant to remember that making mistakes is not inherently wrong. [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|Everyone makes mistakes]] and that's completely okay.

## We often experience the shame of failure privately

We're not often privy to the inner conflicts of other people may experience and [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|everyone has the shared experience]] of doubting themselves at times. Our society has created a [[Cultural roots of shame|culture of shame]] where displaying our difficult times is not something which we share with others so we learn to suffer alone. I shouldn't be so quick to [[Social comparison|compare my moments of weakness with the highlights of others]].

I have many friends who went through their own journeys facing personal setbacks - and I can [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|be grateful]] for them sharing their moments of vulnerabilities with me. Failure is not something which I need to suffer alone - there are [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|people who can support me]].
