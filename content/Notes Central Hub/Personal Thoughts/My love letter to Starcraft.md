# My love letter to starcraft

#status/done

---

Growing up, a game which had great influence on my thought processes was StarCraft: Brood War.

Funny enough, I never actually finished either campaigns. I also happen to suck ass at it lol.

Thinking back to to how it all started, I guess we can give the universal answer to life - it's really all about sex (HA!). My first crush was this cute Korean girl during my middle school summer sessions. I was nothing but a dorky kid but I was really fond of her - so I became infatuated with Korean dramas, Kpop and of course, **StarCraft: Brood War**.

## What starcraft means to me

### Sex rules everything after all

> [!NOTE] A note on misogyny and paternalistic societies
> Even though I find the reference funny, I recognize that it signifies a poor reflection of cultural values. Unfortunately, it's also prevalent in Western societies. We've got work to do.

There's a funny meme that highlights that if you want to marry a Korean girl, you need to defeat her dad at StarCraft. The point is to illustrate the cultural legacy that StarCraft has had on South Korea and how deeply embedded it is within their cultural zeitgeist. It's one of the few countries that saw a meteoric rise in eSports around the early 2000s^[[How StarCraft Changed An Entire Country](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdlSvr_4FXI)] as a result of the government's policy focus on the **fourth industrial revolution** emphasizing internet infrastructure and technology.

> [!NOTE] Read more on the Fourth industrial revolution

Anyways, despite not having much interest in the main story campaign, I felt myself devouring all the online tournament videos even staying up until 3AM to catch Korean live streams. It was fascinating watching players duke it out amongst the three differing races and their approach to problem-solving ([[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts]]) something as nebulous as *victory*.

I was having a recent conversation with a friend and he presented the theory that those who lack a locus of control in their life may gravitate towards chess as it is a game of complete and perfect information ([[Transform information into knowledge]]). I believe that this is better explained within [[The Myth of Normal by Gabor MatÃ© MD]]. The lack of control on one's life is also possibly related to neuroticism ([[Neuroticism]]).

### A game of perfect information and decision-making

StarCraft was my chess.

There are many parallels to draw but in the video game world, it is the closest analogue. Even AI researchers use StarCraft II and its game engine to test out evolutionary learning through AI models ([[Deep Learning]]). For example, DeepMind developed [AlphaStar, a Grandmaster level AI in StarCraft II using multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning).

> [!NOTE] Conducting further research on [[AlphaStar|AlphaStar]] in its own stub

It's really fascinating to see AI researchers create experiments, testing out variables ([[Inputs are transformed into outputs]]) and their impacts on achieving their desired end state - winning the game. I've always been fascinated by warfare as it represents a game of information asymmetry. How do you defeat an opponent with your limited resources and you have incomplete information?

There is also the concept of trading asymmetrical resource trading - can you do a distracting attack/drop consuming your opponent's thought decision cycle in order to give yourself breathing room, providing buffer in your own decision space.

As an eSports spectator, we get the benefit of commentators who provide experience ([[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]) while being able to see through the fog of war - allowing us to have complete information and the power of hindsight (introspection). As a viewer, we also have the ability to take our time to think through decisions and determine the optimal decision path - or at least what we perceive them to be ([[Brains are biased by nature]]).

It allows us to create thought experiments ([[Process information deeply to create knowledge]]) in terms of the optimization decisions - hey that's a math concept! What if X player had decided to recall his units and defend a certain position instead of committing to an engagement? What if they decided to pursue decision path A versus path B? Was it a mistake to focus on their economy ([[Types of resources]]), putting off the present value of their army in exchange for the future strength after committing resources to research and development - a long term payoff?

I feel like this type of thinking is a good simulation of warfare - highlighting my interest in that kind of literature ([[01 List of all books]]). Business is simply warfare applied to corporations and finance. Funnily enough - that's a theme explored in the cyberpunk literature genre.

### Real time strategy is just simulated warfare

On the other hand, players need to respond in the heat of battle while they cope with the fog of war - lacking insight into the decision-making process of their opponents ([[OODA Loop]]). Brood War as a result of its engine limitations only allows one to control a selective amount of units rather than permitting unlimited unit selection via one clumped army^[https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/301216-starcraft-2-and-the-philosophy-of-design]. I personally think this was one of the beautiful things which was lost in its transition to its sequel of StarCraft II.

It's one of the few games I've noticed which stresses a great number of the human player's resources ([[Types of resources]]) such as

 - Physical dexterity ([[Mind-body connection]]) and the ability to execute one's thought loops
 - Equilibrium in economic decision-making (minerals, gas, worker supply) and resource allocation
	 - You need to determine the ROI of each of your type of resources in regards to the future. Invest too much in R&D and your opponent's army will crush you. Invest too much in your army but neglect upgrades? Well that's a paddlin'. JK - you'll get steam rolled by high tech units. What's the right balance mix?
 - Information and turning this into useful actions ([[Transform information into knowledge]])
	 - It's easy to become overwhelmed with so many things to do (macro production, strategic planning, microing your units) - so it's important to convert all of that noise into signal ([[Information overconsumption]])
 - [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|Situational awareness]] ([[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.]]) and the game's tempo with specific game timings
	 - To elaborate on this, each race has specific windows during their evolutionary tree (aka builds) where they are at their strongest. One needs to learn to strike when the iron is hot or we lose your competitive edge.

To further elaborate with the example of attention, your decision-making capabilities is stretched across so many contexts that your brain may have challenges keeping up ([[Information overconsumption]]). In general, our minds can only remember so much ([[Working memory is limited]]). I don't believe that good players have an innate superhuman advantage in terms of processing information ([[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information]]) but rather they develop alternative coping strategies through building better schemas ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) and shortcuts ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]]).

These need to be ingrained via [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]].

## The theme of evolution

> [!warning] WIP stub
> I'll think about this more some other time

- Zergs evolve and resource consumption. Think of adrenal boost. They would shit on everyone else if the campaign was in real life. Within the lore, they're able to assimilate, develop niches and out-compete.
- Humans' ability to learn is our natural competitive advantage ([[Humans are motivated to grow]]) This applies at a player-factor level.

## The final boss of starcraft: 'Flash' lee young ho

![[Pasted image 20230203094419.png]]

> [!NOTE] One of my favorite articles about Flash
> God Young-Ho aka the Terminator aka Final boss of Starcraft: [The Ultimate Weapon](https://tl.net/forum/final-edits/108774-the-ultimate-weapon)

Do you know how good this StarCraft god is? He's probably one of the greatest video game players to ever live and his competitive field was no slouch either. However, they're such a distant runner up. I don't think I can put into words how much he surpasses everyone and his overall dominance with a global win rate above 70%.^[https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Flash#Matchup_Statistics] He's genuinely one of my inspirations and idols.

"Flash epitomizes the well-rounded StarCraft player, combining strategic versatility, decision making, and mechanics."^[https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Flash#Style].

> There's a whole other article to write about him - but Bonjwas exhibit divergent thinking in their approaches to game metas, learning to think outside the box to develop new strategies and taking advantage of unexploited niches ([[Find your niche]]) - like dropships!

### Marginal gains to develop consistency

Through observing him, I began understanding that marginal gains lead to absolute advantage over a long enough period of time. To what extent can you optimize your builds? Your macro? Your micro? Your ergonomic setup? Your big dick energy? Everything can be improved ([[Use little bets to test for breakthrough ideas]]).

As the problem space gets more complicated ([[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts]]), and we introduce more possible decision paths, we can reduce outcome variance through higher quality decisions ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]). If we compare this to machine learning ([[Machine Learning]]) models, introducing more data and the law of large numbers allows the better player to win more often over a longer match time horizon - an example of return to the mean. Funnily enough, one of his nicknames is the Terminator - a machine. Not bad eh?

> [!quote]
> Flash's decision making is a more pressing reason why many players try not to get into a protracted macro game with him.^[https://liquipedia.net/starcraft/Flash#Style]

Towards the later end of his career, with his overall mastery of the game and developed reputation, he was able to undertake riskier strategies which left him unpredictable to further cement his leads. I believe one of his competencies was being able to decipher signals out of the complex space of StarCraft. What levers can you pull? This includes your opponents' psychology? What they believe to be true can be weaponized - an example of their bias ([[Brains are biased by nature]]). That's psychological warfare.

#### Flash's obsession with rulers

> [!NOTE] Here are some pics of him measuring his setup and ensuring consistent keyboard/mouse setup

![[Pasted image 20230203100333.png|400]]

![[Pasted image 20230203100243.png|400]]

He illustrates the power of setting the up the right contexts ([[Personality is shaped our environment]]) for repeatability and habit formation. For example, there's that famous picture where he's caught measuring the height between his mousepad and his keyboard. That's an example of getting rid of one distraction ([[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind]]) and free up one more [[Working memory is limited|working memory unit]].

If you are able to focus aka getting rid of distractions ([[Remove distractions through minimalism]]) - this is an edge in our attention economy.

### Shifting the meta

There is a term within the StarCraft community to call the great geniuses - "Bonjwas"^[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bonjwa] which refers to someone who is at the top of their field ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]). I believe many of them exhibit the traits of geniuses ([[Geniuses and divergent thinking]]) and their ability for divergent thought processes ([[Relationship between divergent thinking and authenticity]]).

Most of them in their meteoric rise introduce something new to the game meta, a shift in thinking and approach ([[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time]]) such as new types of build orders, or moving from 1-base type thinking to long-term focused macro (*iloveoov*, the 2nd bonjwa exemplifies this paradigm shift).

Flash would not be afraid of introducing new builds such as the *"+1 5 rax builds"* or experimenting with underused units such as Valkyries in bio builds. He was able to find new purpose for these overlooked units ([[Find your niche]]) despite the game having been out out for over 10 years by that point. You would think it's a 'solved problem' in that case right? Nope - Brood War is complex dude.

### To stay on the throne, you can't sit on your laurels

So cool - you know how to shift the meta but everyone is **constantly learning and adapting** ([[Evolution is an arms race]]). This arms race is similar to the Red Queen effect, observed in nature.

Each match is a proving ground to show how robust your build is - and only the truly good ones survive. They will only take over as the new paradigm in a game matchup through survival of the fittest. Each game is a new iteration and refinement of a build with victory or loss giving you signals ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]). This is evolutionary theory in play. But he kept reinventing himself, constantly pushing his niche advantage through explorations of micro-advantages ([[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]]). Flash maintained his dominance for over ten years - that's like a billion years in eSport times.

> [!NOTE] Build order and selective evolutionary pressure
> This process of strengthening and reinforcement ([[Feedback loop]]) is very similar to [[neuroplasticity]] ([[Neuroplasticity]]). Good builds get reinforced through popularization and execution refinement.
>
> However, just because you came up with a build or idea, doesn't mean you are good at mechanically executing it. *Gotta practice ([[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]). Git good.*

### Become better at everything, everywhere, all at once

Furthermore, he's the poster child of [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]. I've watched countless pro analysis videos and his deep insight to explain exactly why he executes each of his decisions is as close to perfect as one can achieve. If you can't explain something with precision, you can stand to learn more ([[Learn anything like Feynman]]). That's how one achieves mastery. Scrutinize everything ([[How Experts Figure What to Focus On]]).

I remember watching a [few videos explaining his thought process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5OkVBeHb2o) and being astounded by the level of details to individual unit movement scouting patterns and being able to relate it to late-game consequences. These are examples of second order thinking patterns^[[Second-Order Thinking: What Smart People Use to Outperform - Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/second-order-thinking/#:~:text=Second%20order%20thinkers%20ask%20themselves,likely%20to%20eat%20something%20healthy.)].

Macro god. Micro god. Strategic god. Game was too easy and he had mastered Terran - so he decided to play random 'for the lulz'. Never stop improving ([[Talent Is Overrated by Geoff Colvin]].

I feel like I have struggled with loss of direction in life, and there are some quotes which I would like to keep close to my heart when I imagine [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]].

## Final reflections

I always wondered why I've gravitated towards video games. I think to me they were interesting thought experiments where I could control how I approach information ([[Transform information into knowledge]]) and refine my understanding of this microcosm.

My other game obsessions was TF2 where I've put in over 5000 hours ([[The 10 000-hour rule]]) and played at a semi-professional level and Counter-Strike where I played as a strat caller at the age of 13 years old.

It was fun learning about you StarCraft ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]). You've shaped my interest in gaming, data, business and warfare. Hopefully one day I can go see a Brood War match in person if I visit South Korea!
