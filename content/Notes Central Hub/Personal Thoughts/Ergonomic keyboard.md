# Ergonomic keyboard

#status/done

---

I want to take care of my body and I work at the keyboard a lot.

I'm noticing that my Keychron K2 and my other keyboard are putting shoulder strain as a result of their width. Split keyboards exist to adjust to individual's shoulder widths.

- [[Tim Vieregge]] uses an [ErgoDox EZ: An Incredible Mechanical Ergonomic Keyboard](https://ergodox-ez.com/) and recommends it
- That company is also releasing the [ZSA Moonlander: Next-gen Ergonomics | zsa.io](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) soon so I'll have to try it out
