# Falling in love with reading through connection of the human experience

## Reading is tapping into a collective humanistic experience

To read [[books]] is to extend a part of yourself. To join an extended web of experience, similar or dissimilar to ourselves. What you have experienced, yet to experience, the different. To read about something is to add new colour, new nuance to the tapestry of our being.

Perhaps it is impossible to ever comprehend another, but we can seek to develop a vocabulary of shared [[Writing is the medium by which we think|understanding]]. Your ancestry of experiences, through sharing they become my own.

Isn't there a paradox that [[Words are inherently reductive]], through semantics, intentionality, bias and language yet to convey the richness of an experience, humans lack better tools? Each word penned is the zeitgeist of one's cultural experience crystallized at this moment in time. But it connects. It helps you grow. To tap into a tapestry of collectivity. How beautiful to gaze at worlds unknown, each book its own universe.

Yet we read to learn more about ourselves, but is it to find wholeness in sharing? Don't we wish that we could unveil but a sliver and let another peer in? Isn't that [[Writing to learn|why we write]], communicate?

How wonderful. How mesmerizing.

## Falling in love with words

Is it possible to fall in [[Neurochemistry of love|love]] with mere glimpses of words? They are but a reduction of your shade.

The way one writes, the things left unsaid. Ha√Økus exemplify this. To wish to know another's world oh so deep. To meld the minds in unity as one. Isn't that what [[Love can take many forms and definitions|love]] is? To become more than I. To be something more.

Yet the struggle of spirituality is to honour the otherness of the world. Oh to be but a small fish in the sea yet the wonder yearns to discover the ends of its depths.

Would it be but beautiful but to partake in each other's beings? Jang it an interesting duality, I wish to show you my self but the desire is to become whole, but to lose its essence in a process of destruction and rebirth.
