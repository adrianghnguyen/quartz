## Why do home workout routines?

I do a lot of cycling, so my lower body is pretty OK for the most part. In addition, my cardio is also pretty good. I would like to take care of my upper body so I don't start looking like a T Rex from cycling. I asked chat GPT design me a routine with only use of dumbbells which I could do at home while listening to things.

Just as [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] is part of [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|mental development]], working out my body is taking care of my [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body]]. I wish to be a healthy person live a long life so I can keep loving the people I do.
