### English lyrics

> [!NOTE] English Translated Lyrics
> The world is so cold
> Colder than when I lived in you
> You gave me enough love and when I felt
> That it was too much I became an adult
> To raise a single flower
> How much rain fell in your eyes?
>
> Oh rewind, the more I think back, the more I’m sorry
> So I won’t give up
> You gave up your youthful and beautiful season
> Look at me, I have bloomed prettily
> Even if I fall to the ground
> I will make you walk only on flower paths
>
> When I looked at your lips
> There was a smile but there were also wrinkles
> You gifted me with life
> I’m so thankful for the words, I love you
>
> To raise a single flower
> How much rain fell in your eyes?
>
> Oh rewind, the more I think back, the more I’m sorry
> So I won’t give up
>
> You gave up your youthful and beautiful season
> Look at me, I have bloomed prettily
> Even if I fall to the ground
> I will make you walk only on flower paths
>
> Even when winter comes
> My heart is filled with scent of spring
> Because of your love
> That never withers
>
> Oh rewind, time is like a short wind
> Your time has become a flower pot
> That holds me and doesn’t shake
> Look here, there’s only happiness that remains
> Lay everything down and hold my hand
> I will make you walk only on flower paths
> \- [English translation of Flower Road](https://lyricstranslate.com/en/%EA%BD%83%EA%B8%B8-flower-road.html)

## Why it means so much to me?

I cry often while listening to it. Sejeong is one of the brightest artists that came out of the industry recently. She's extremely hardworking and I think part of it is due to her childhood and upbringing.

When I heard that this song is actually about Sejeong's experiences thinking back to her upbringing how much she realized that her mom sacrificed it hits close to home with my own.

I know I still hold onto a lot of resentment anger but I know it's not your fault.  You did the best you could and [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|I'm happy]] for that. I will build you a flower road.

[[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|I'm happy]] that you're [[Tran Huynh|my mom]]. I love you. I know it hasn't been easy…but I believe in us.
