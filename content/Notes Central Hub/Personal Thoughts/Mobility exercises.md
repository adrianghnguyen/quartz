# Stretching is keeping the body in motion

You're getting old. Learn to take care of your body so you can take care of your brain, a very valuable asset indeed ([[Mind-body connection]]). I'll try to incorporate these into my daily [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|self-care routines]], alongside [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] and taking my medication.

Taking care of one's body help with stress management. I learn the most from my [massage therapist](https://massotherapiecoaching.com/) [[Maellig Le Mezec]]. She provides a holistic perspective of body-mind when it comes to health. I adore her. She taught me that the posterior chain…is well a chain. As a result, pain in one area of the body causes other muscles to compensate (poorly).

## Proper chair sitting posture

[Best posture for sitting: why the torso is forward and the pelvis against the chair backrest... - YouTube](https://youtu.be/TOd_e5iZ9tM)

- Maximize weight distribution on hip bones
- Slightly forward to reduce lower back flexion
- Use lumbar support to prevent back rollback
- Feet should be touching the ground and gently supporting weight.

## Specific mobility exercises

[[Maellig Le Mezec]] recommended that I do the following exercises.

### Shoulder blade mobility

- [https://youtube.com/shorts/NqV2KKEsg6c?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/NqV2KKEsg6c?feature=share)

Do band stretch for shoulder blades. It's like you're flossing your back with a towel. Try to keep neck and torso neutral. This helps alleviate carpal tunnel as the elbow joint is connected to the trapezius.

> Avec une bande Élastique en gardant les coudes pliés, imaginez, vous essuyer le dos. Attention de ne pas pousser le torse en avant et de garder la tête bien droite.

### Spinal and lower back mobility

Use a rolled hand towel and place it on the lower back, directly underneath shoulder blades with elevated knees and flat feet on the ground. This should be not be done *no more than ten minutes*, and should only be done *once a day at most.*

> Alongé sur le dos les pieds au sol et genoux relevés. Mettre une serviette roulée juste en dessous des omoplates. Garder la posture environ 10 min.

## Activating glutes

I went to see [[Maellig Le Mezec]] recently as I was experiencing groin pain. She said it was a result of poor glute activation as well as my body experiencing stress. The [[Mind-body connection|body is a holistic system]] after all with my mental experiences probably impacting my overall stress levels leading to poor sleep.

### Toe raises

- Do a set of 5x2.
- The goal is to activate the glutes (engage the butt cheeks) while raising one's self on toes without leaning forward.

### Mindful staircase ascent and descent

- This is similar to raising our toes.
- When taking steps down, for the foot planted to the ground, consciously engage the glute as you take a step down
- I look like a silly penguin and walk very slowly down staircases now.

## Neck pain and upper back tension

- [Corpse pose](https://photos.cdn-outlet.com/yo-images/userfiles/guide/image/yoga/yoga_corpsepose_300x350.jpg)
	- Focus on letting the body melt into the mattress
	- Extra bonus: Stick a pillow under the neck to relieve cervical/neck pain

Thinking too much can lead to upper body tension. Ways of dealing with stress may lower this.

## Hip Flexion

[[My love for cycling|Cycling]] is a very static sport and it requires opening up the hips in terms of the motion of pedaling. It would be important to increase my hip flexibility by doing lean overs.

All of these are dowe while laying on a flat surface. They're important since we often sit at computer chairs all day long causing our hip flexors to become overly tight.

| Knee hug                      | Hug one knee while pulling it at a 45 degree angle towards the opposite shoulder. Hold the position for a few minutes. It should be felt on the outside of the hip.                                                                                                                            |
| 4-shape                       | While keeping one leg straight and flat to the ground, have the opposing leg fold over, creating something like a 4 shape. The heel should be resting on the other leg's knee, while focusing on keeping the hip open.                                                                         |
| Lateral leg cross (ballerina) | One leg flat and straight out at the six o clock position. Cross the leg over diagonally at the 8 or 4 o clock positions. Arms should be in a t-position. Head should be pointing towards the opposing side of the crossing leg to elongate the stretch throughout the entire posterior chain. |
| Lunge stretch                 | Make lunge, keep one leg back with the knee touching the ground. Move forward                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Dealing with knee pain

I overused by quads during the [[2023-09|month of September 2023]]

- Butterfly stretch
	- Lie on the back then splay the knees out
- Keep the back straight while pulling the leg back
- Foam rolling the quad
- Roll a ball under my calves
