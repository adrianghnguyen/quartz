# Applying my moral standards on others

Related to [[2023-08-17]]

I had a [[Meaningful conversations require humility and exploration|meaningful conversation]] with my friend %%[[Poe Han Thar Kyaw|Poe]]%% last night. We talked about why I was such a [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|judgmental person]] and the application of moral standards onto other people. I guess I have never walked into their shoes and should try to respect their own personal world views.

A good point is that perhaps I cannot change their opinions, perhaps it is not even my place to judge in the first place. I think that being judgmental of others is more of a reflection of my own [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurities]]. Additionally, people act in different ways because their [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|different personal value guide our behaviours in different ways]].

What is the point of criticizing if it is not meant for feedback? And feedback is a [[Knowledge is a gift|the gift of knowledge]]. So perhaps it is unwanted in the first place, or perhaps it's misdirected. [[Be succinct when communicating|Some things are better left unsaid]] or kept to my own personal mind.

Not everything needs to be shared and perhaps it's worth taking the time to introspect.
