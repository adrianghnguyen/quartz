# The zen of the accountabilabuddy

It's a bloody mouthful - but it is fun to say. I think it's an apt phrase to describe my philosophy to [[Levels of friendship vary by their core function|friendship]] - *[[Personal responsibility is having accountability|accountability]] + buddy = accountabilabuddy*.

It's essentially my promise to you as our lives intertwine. [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|I also recognize that in future time and decay, our paths may diverge]]. I am glad to be part of your journey within this present. I want to grow with you and [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|honour our connection]].  [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|Real friendship]] takes work and [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|sources of happiness]].

For some reason, it makes me think of Spongebob - so here's an image. Maybe because it sounds like bubble buddy?

## As your friend, I promise to

> Show up with gratitude as you are inviting me along your [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|journey]]
> [[Happiness requires action|Create valuable memories in our time spent]]
> Give you [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|my sincere self]]
> With [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|all of my heart]]
> Which [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|may be limited in capacity on some days]]
> By [[Honest communication is clear|exchanging honest thoughts]]
> [[Humans are motivated to grow|Challenge you to become a better person]]
> [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|Remind you to be patient]] and [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|kind to yourself]] when times are tough
> When [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|I do something wrong]]
> [[Apologizing sincerely requires action|Admit my mistakes]]
> And [[Continuous feedback leads to change|listen for continuous feedback|look for ways to do better]]
