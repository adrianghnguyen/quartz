There's been a lot happening recently. I recently came back to Ottawa to visit and perhaps overexerted myself trying to do too much. There has been many tears, from my time staying at my friend %% [[Justin Li|Justin Li]]'s %% to sharing the what's latest with others. %% [[Vlad Pripotnev|Vlad]] and [[Stephanie Kim|Stephanie Kim]] %%

[[2023-12-04|Today]] I asked my mom to go for a walk with me, where I simply wished to share my burden with her. How I've been feeling overwhelmed, a bit helpless and just general hopelessness. We started by going on a walk. It's been snowing much recently and I actually missed my previous poparide due to it. As karma comes around, I was also late for today's but perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, as it gave me a chance to have a meaningful conversation with her. I'm not sure if she sees it in such a positive manner.

We began the walk with me sharing my thoughts on how I view my current situation. It's been a while since I left my job, uncertain of future prospects and certainly uncertain about my level of emotional resilience. I know one is not meant to compare to others, no sense in misery and happiness competitions. I think back to what my friend %% [[Stephanie Kim|Stephanie Kim]] %% said the other day, poverty or perhaps lack of stability and safety in childhood, is incredibly detrimental to children's mental health with [[Early childhood experiences exert lifelong outcomes|lasting consequences]].

I know my mother has been trying to be better over the years, to be reading books and becoming a better person. And perhaps I still ask too much ofh er which is unfair of me. At a certain point in our conversation, she had asked me if she could give me a suggestion. I believe at the beginning, I had asked her to simply listen, and to leave constructive advice for a later time. My yearning was for someone to understand and validate my emotional pain. I tried my best to be patient and to hear her out. She mentioned that perhaps it's worth considering meeting a new therapist, if after so many years, I felt like I have not progressed in terms of my mental health journey.

Isn't it odd that giving yourself advice from the perspective of another person can allow the brain to see situations in a different lens? Regardless, I had explained to her that if I needed to think to what [[Dominique Clement|my therapist]] would say, she'd probably say that right now I am going through [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional pain]] - and this is not something permanent but something we go through. That in our many years of therapy together, I have [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|grown as a person]] and learned new skills of [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]]. Something for which I should learn to remind myself and [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|celebrate]].
But maybe there's validity in taking more drastic approaches, which I've begun exploring by myself such as [[Psilocybin|psychedelic therapy]] in the hopes of finding a more permanent solution towards [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]].

She had a small outburst of emotions - where she felt the burden of her guilt in me blaming my childhood. I can understand her position - I'm not sure how to convey the fact that I don't think she's a bad mother, nor do I blame her as a person for the circumstances that were given to us. I'd like to think that I can recognize internally that it wasn't her fault, that I [[Forgiveness increases well-being|forgive]] her and recognize that it was a result of events which led to an emotionally difficult upbringing.

Perhaps I could seek to be more kind in our interactions to recognize the efforts she is making, to [[Be grateful for the gift of the relationship|honour the relationship]]. But I also need her to hold emotional space for me, to give me a safe space to express my emotions. Perhaps I should learn to recognize that this is impossible - she can never be that for me and to learn to let go of this burden. How do I reconcile that with my desire to be close to another?

During the conversation she also mentioned that for many years now, she has prayed that I would become better and healthier. I asked her to clarify, as part of me, had taken to it with sadness, that she perhaps believes in my hopelessness. She clarified that wasn't the case but to be frank, I am not sure how to comprehend the rest of the conversation.

I gritted throughout the conversation, to help provide emotional space for her feelings and that's something for which I can be [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|proud of.]] At the same time, I perhaps could have made better use of a proper emotional boundary in terms of not expressing my feelings?

I wish those were the words I could [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|tell myself]] and hear: You're not a loser. It seems like you're going through a significant amount of [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional pain]] recently. I know it must be difficult. I think you'll find eventual [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|meaning in this suffering]], even if now it does not seem quite evident. Please don't give up for yourself as there are others who cherish you deeply.

I'm honestly not quite sure to make of this entire experience - was it a positive one? Did it help me process my stress [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|with intent]]? Do I feel better for it?

I wish I could speak to her as an equal person, or not as a teacher. And I am afraid of falling into this dynamic of superiority. I genuinely wish to be kind and understand her side of things, so I do my best to approach the conversation with a sense of humility but I'm not sure if I am able to do so.

She often tells me, do I set the bar too high for myself? And I honestly wish she didn't say that to me. I want to do more. I want to achieve more. But I need to temper that with patience - but please don't tell me to give up on things I care about (my uncharitable interpretation). I think with time, patience and good strategy, a lot of things can be achieved. I'm probably filtering a lot of what she says under my own personal bias but I would like to try to think that I am making [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|charitable assumptions]] and trying to see it in the best perspective. Maybe I've failed at doing so - hurting her. I'll [[Apologizing sincerely requires action|apologize]] for doing so.

I just find it difficult to try and juggle speaking what I wish to convey, seeking comfort and support while at the same time regulating the conversation. Perhaps it's not my role - to not expect to control what I cannot control, to learn to [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|let go of attachment and expectations]]…even of my own mother.  How do I maintain a proper sense of emotional self-control while creating emotional vulnerability with a bond which is important to me? I'm not sure how to create the proper balance.

The world seems a bit colder when I feel like I need to be my own beacon of safety. Perhaps that is what I need to strive for. I need to go back to the roots of [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|recognizing our shared interconnectivity]]. I'm just [[Emotional and physical burnout|emotionally exhausted]] to be honest.

## Aftermath

My mom came into the room (I'm still in Ottawa) to tell me she moved our next family therapy appointment with [[Marleen MacDonald|Marleen MacDonald]]. I took the chance to apologize for blaming her on my childhood woes and she ended up crying some more.

She also shared to this small anecdote from [[Personal reflections on my childhood|my childhood]] - apparently for mother's day back in school or something like that I had written a letter or some kind of message where I wrote that I would die in exchange for my mother's pain or suffering. Something along those lines. I honestly don't remember writing something like that, but I do remember writing an emotional poem comparing myself to a broken vase for which I am grateful of my mother helping stitch together.

I don't feel like it's fair that I had to go through such emotional difficulties - and wish I could go through them with more resilience - but that's probably taking a [[A mindset of acceptance and being non-judgmental towards emotions|judgemental attitude towards emotions]]. I should learn to make space for my lived experience, and to grieve how challenging it all was. Because…it was difficult right? Right?

Could I pretend that it doesn't hurt me? That it does not exist and to [[Emotional suppression and denial|wish it all away]]?

My mom replied that she wished she could become more sick, if it meant that I was a happier person. I…I understand the sentiment but I don't know if that's how I wish the situation to be seen. But I'm not sure how to nurture my own flower to bloom and prosper.
