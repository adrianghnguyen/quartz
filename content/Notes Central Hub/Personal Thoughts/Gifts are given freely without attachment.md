## Personal thoughts on giving and receiving gifts

I had a discussion with a friend the other day we were talking about the topics of gift giving and how one should learn to accept it. In my opinion, the important part of receiving gift is accepting the thought behind it, but the material object is not necessarily as important. It is true that the person who is giving it to you. Their [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|feelings]] do matter, but the actual object I'm my pain should be taken or it can be given away. I would personally not feel remorse giving away a gift that someone has given to me, and likewise if someone did it to me, I would be fine with it. Otherwise, it would be [[Hypocrisy|hypocritical]] of me.

As a person. I tend to be more of a minimalist, so I only hold onto sentimental objects. In terms of physical properties, the only things I generally books and my digital devices which allow me to store things virtually. My primary indulgence are kitchen items because I love cooking. I often think of Marie Kondo, who put it so succinctly: Did it spark joy? Did it live a good life and can we give it a new home?

Perhaps [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] is involved in this process. I'm not so sure.

It's also my way to practice [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|non-attachment]] which is part of my core beliefs. We can savour the moment - and let things to. Maybe being faced with the concept of mortality at a young age has given me comfort in living in the moment to moment.



## Gifts with strings attached are selfish

No such thing as a free lunch. Gifts given from a place of abundance differ much from one given from selfish needs to fill the gift giver's ego. When giving something with the thought of "I hope the other person enjoys this", it is selfish as we are asking for someone to nurture our [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]]. We will be hurt if they do not receive it in the way that we had hoped.

I think to grow as a person and to become self-realized, we should learn to see ourselves as truly distinct from the other. We give from a place of abundance, for our own sake and not for that of the other. The mere act of giving is what should bring us joy.
