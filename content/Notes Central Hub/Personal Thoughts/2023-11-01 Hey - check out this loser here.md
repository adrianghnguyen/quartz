Life doesn't feel so great at the moment. I know the mind is prone to [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] but this is hurting a lot. And part of me just feels like laughing at it all. I guess I'm kind of a loser - I'm saying that in the best of ways.  All I do is feel like laughing. I'm not exactly feeling upset at myself…but I do wonder if I did anything wrong to deserve this. I know that the world is merely neutral - it's not a question of being rewarded with things or not - it simply is.

But I just would like to say wow - things are really sucking ass at the moment. Can I just throw my hands up and give up? Part of me feels like [[Self-protection and anxiety avoidance|retreating into a cocoon]] and just sleep peacefully. I don't know if journaling is even helping me at the moment as I am simply writing out my stream of consciousness.

I don't know what I'm thinking. I don't know what I wish to do. The world spins around and I feel like I'm not really doing my job as an adult and failing. It's also important to recognize that my [[Mental illness|mental health issues]] are top of mind at the moment and I'm prone to [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions]].

Maybe I'm just a loser? It's hard to think about the thing I've done right in my life. Questions which come up to me…
- Why have I not found love?
- Why am I not succeeding in my career?
- Why do I feel trapped by my past? 

[[Moving on from the past|Feeling unable to move on]] and [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|being stuck]].

I have not found love…because perhaps I have not taken enough risks to try and get myself out there. Doing more hobbies, meeting more people and just keeping an open mind. At the same time, I think it's important to question why it is such an important thing for me to find - I know that most of the time I come from a place of neediness. Part of me feels like I am deeply unlovable…otherwise why would people be leaving me constantly?

Maybe there's more room to fill in terms of self-love and [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]] before I feel ready to [[Navigating the dating world|start dating again]]. All I know is that my heart feels a bit too fragile at the moment - as if it is but the thinnest of glass. I need a lot of love and support to go through these difficulties. What really happened is the person simply said that we may not be a romantic fit - and perhaps being rejected on a dating app has more to do with the other person than me. Being realistic with myself here - have I put my true authentic self out there? Or have I sought to mold myself to the image of another person.

It's a sad thought to have to feel like I am [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|unworthy of love]]. To be [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|deeply ashamed]] of my existence. I also think it's important to recognize that even though I have these [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|automatic thoughts, which are suggestions of the mind]] they may not have a true basis in reality. I am trying to use the [[Use the disputation strategy to overcome pessimism through facts|disputation strategy to overcome pessimism through facts]].

I wish I had [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]] around. I know [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] is a strong and resilient woman - but I needed tenderness to survive. I needed love, to be held and to be made feel special. I am sad and grieving to think that other people in the world had an opportunity to hold his hand, to receive a warm hug from him. Would I have been a happier child if I had a chance to see his warm smile? Would we have played together?

I asked [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] during our therapy session if we even played peekaboo together. Why was I born into this world if I wasn't wanted? I know it's not true…but it's how I feel. I just want the [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional suffering]] to stop. I know that [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|healing from trauma]] is possible - but why must it be so difficult? Why am I not stronger for getting through this time of difficulty with grace? Is it because [[Social comparison|I imagine others]] would handle it better? 

Why does it have to so painful - as if I need to live with a stake in my heart which I cannot remove?

I am crying. Crying alone. I do not wish to compare my misery to others but I don't know if I'm strong enough to get through this. It just hurts. It hurts. It hurts.

Tears cloud my thoughts. I talked to [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|heyPI]] and I feel like it helped me out a bit. If only to vent and receive [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|virtual compassion from technology]].
