## Project log

> [!info] Project Log Instructions
> Writing down my thoughts as I tackle the project such as questions, what I've accomplished, etc. It should be written diary style and help clarify how I can proceed to the next steps.

Didn't write much as this was a test project brief.

### Learned lessons

> [!faq] What went well? What went poorly? What can we do better?

Was surprisingly easy? Had to look up a couple of references but my previous work at Samsung Adgear was quite useful in terms of understanding the framework of what a CI pipeline is supposed to do.

I had to clean up some of my note formatting and reflect on how I want people to navigate the content. I think after a bit of polish, I've gotten down the workflow.

The goal was to share my [[Share your journey publicly|public journey of thoughts]].
