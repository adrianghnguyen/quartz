# Emotion wheel app

- Create an emotion wheel app
- People can write in how they're feeling, it tells them what they are most likely feeling
- Hover over an emotion and have it described
	- [Feelings Wheel](https://feelingswheel.com/)

## Goals and Key success factors %% fold %%

- Program side
	- User can input text
	- User receives results of detected emotion
	- User receives feedback on what emotion was detected
- Understand how LLM was trained to classify emotion task
- Understand what resulting scores represent
- The objective is to learn how to deploy python to a web environment using Flask

### Desired functionalities, behaviours and expectations %% fold %%

Things I want the project to have by the end
- UI side
	- Display input box + submit button
	- Explain the purpose of this project/provide context
	- Looks like a modern or non ugly looking page design (use Bootstrap?)
	- Display emotion detected scores
	- Display label definition
	- After results, have a button to go back to home/redirect to home
- Functionalities
	- Allow user to retrigger or reprocess the emotions according to a new threshold. Alternatively, is there a way to dynamically only show elements if they have a certain user-value without needing to reload the page or re-trigger.
	- Allow user to enter in text and retrieve a page response
	- Intake text through emotion labeling model to determine scores
	- Hosted on an external server/not local host
	- Ability to split multi-line text?

### Technical project notes

#### WebStorage API

- Can store session data and maintain browser data. Might want to look into `localStorage` which can persist after browser is closed/reopened

##### Exporting ansd importing data with localstorage


[Chrome Extension: Local Storage, how to export - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23160600/chrome-extension-local-storage-how-to-export)
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(null, function(items) { // null implies all items
	// Convert object to a string.
	var result = JSON.stringify(items);

	// Save as file
	var url = 'data:application/json;base64,' + btoa(result);
	chrome.downloads.download({
		url: url,
		filename: 'filename_of_exported_file.json'
	});
});
```

#### The machine learning model for encoding emotions

- [GoEmotions: A Dataset of Fine-Grained Emotions | Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/goemotions-a-dataset-of-fine-grained-emotions) - paper which describes the dataset which uses it
- Some researchers built something quite similar to what I did in this paper: [Frontiers | Detection of emotion by text analysis using machine learning](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1190326/full) where they created a website which allows users to input text, and detect emotions accordingly.

#### Learning Flask and web deployments

- [[Flask web app framework]]
- [[REF Free-For-Dev development resources|REF GitHub - ripienaar/free-for-dev: A list of SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings that have free tiers of interest to devops and infradev]]

#### Deploying an app to production

- [My Journey to a serverless transformers pipeline on Google Cloud](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-deploy-a-pipeline-to-google-clouds) May be useful? They use Google App Engine

### How should people understand how to use this app?

Learn more about the concept of a feelings wheel

> The Feelings Wheel offers a unique and nuanced approach to identifying and comprehending emotions. It‚Äôs a tool that allows individuals to better navigate their inner emotional landscapes and foster healthier emotional intelligence.
>
> The Feelings Wheel can serve as a guide to understand the intricate web of emotions we all feel and their interconnectedness with other emotions. It‚Äôs a powerful tool that can help you explore your feelings more deeply and also express them more accurately so you can get the support you need, or simply process whatever emotions you‚Äôre navigating.
>
> Benefits:
> - Help you communicate more effectively by understand in more details what you may be feeling
> - Provides mindful reflection and enhances emotional awareness
> - Supports emotional regulation through the ability to identify and label your emotions your feelings
