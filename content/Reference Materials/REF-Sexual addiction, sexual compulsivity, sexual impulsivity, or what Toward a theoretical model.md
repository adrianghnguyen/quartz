# Sexual Addiction, Sexual Compulsivity, Sexual Impulsivity, or What? Toward a Theoretical Model

## Personal Notes

> In some circumstances, when sexual connection with another person is motivated by the need to make personal contact or the need
> for self-validation or improvement of self-esteem, mood improvement may be the driving force.
>
> However, an alternative pattern possibly relevant to much of sexual acting out is that the negative mood, particularly if associated with increased arousal (i.e., anxiety), leads to sexual arousal by means of excitation transfer.
>
> Once sexual arousal is established, there will be an intrinsic drive toward sexual release through orgasm, which will have the incentive of transient
> pleasure and post-orgasm calming. Such a sequence may then become reinforced and established by conditioning, with the individual learning to think sexual thoughts (or seek out sexual stimuli) when feeling such negative mood. This explanation is consistent with the fact that more often than not the individual knows in advance, as a result of experience, that the transient reward will be outweighed by the longer term negative consequences.
