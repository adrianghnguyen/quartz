Based on the paper, [Frontiers | Key Considerations for Incorporating Conversational AI in Psychotherapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00746/full), there are two proposed dimensions of disruption for the patient-practitioner relationship :
1. Dimensions of impact - aka how much it'll change the current care paradigm
2. Care delivery approach - the level of intervention of [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] in the patient-clinician dynamic

Here are some key points in the article about [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|artificial intelligence (AI) used in mental healthcare]]:
- It can provide additional resources to strained mental healthcare practitioners numbers
- Automate diagnostic assessments which are labour intensive and serve as diagnostic aid reviews.
- Reduce menial tasks and clinician burnout but it has also been criticized for distancing the clinicians from patient care
- Reduce self-disclosure from patients as opposed to questionnaires which prevents the clinician from making certain diagnoses

It will continue to be important to maintain trust in the tools to also maintain the bond between practitioner and client.
