## Introduction of FM5

Planning - **the art and science of understanding a situation, envisioning a desired future, and laying out effective ways of bringing that future about** - is a key activity of the operations process. While planning may start an iteration of the operations process, planning does not stop with the production of an order. During preparation and execution, commanders and staffs continuously revise the plan based on changing circumstances and the assessed progress of an operation.

An outcome of planning is a plan or order that serves as a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]] of anticipated actions that guide subordinates through each phase of an operation. Since planning is continuous, a plan or order is an interim product based on information and understanding at a moment that is subject to revision. The measure of a good plan is not whether execution transpires as planned, but whether the plan facilitates effective action in the face of unforeseen events.

Operations demand a flexible approach that adapts planning methods to each situation. An effective planning process helps structure the thinking of commanders and staffs while supporting their insight and creativity. Fm 5-0 describes several planning methodologies commanders and staffs use to help understand situations; develop solutions to problems; direct, coordinate, and synchronize actions; prioritize efforts; and anticipate events.
