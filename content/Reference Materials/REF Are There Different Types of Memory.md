[Memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-memory-2795006) is the ability to store and retrieve information when people need it. The four general types of memory are sensory memory, short-term memory, working memory, and [[long-term memory]]. [[Long-term memory]] can be further categorized as either implicit (unconscious) or explicit (conscious).

Memories make us [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|who we are]] as individuals, yet we don’t put a lot of thought into how memory works. It’s a phenomenon that involves several processes and can be split into different types, each of which plays an important role in the retention and recall of information.

For years, researchers and experts have debated the classification of memories. Many experts agree that there are four main categories of memory. All other types of memory tend to fall under these four major categories. 

Memory is sometimes also classified into stages and processes. People who classify memory into only two distinctive types, [implicit and explicit memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/implicit-and-explicit-memory-2795346), view that other types of memories like sensory, short-term, and long-term memories aren’t types of memory but [stages of memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-are-the-5-stages-of-memory-5496658).

## Sensory Memory

[Sensory memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-sensory-memory-2795352) allows you to remember sensory information after the stimulation has ended. Researchers who classify memory more as stages than types believe that all other memories begin with the formation of sensory memories. Typically your sensory memory only holds on to information for brief periods. Remembering the sensation of a person’s touch or a sound you heard in passing is sensory memory.

When a sensory experience keeps recurring, and you start to attach other memories to it, the sensory experience stops living in your sensory memory. It might move to your short-term memory or more permanently to your long-term memory.

There are three types of sensory memory: [iconic](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-iconic-memory-2795272), which is obtained through sight; echoic, which is auditory; and haptic, which is through touch.

## Short-term Memory

As the name implies, [short-term memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-short-term-memory-2795348) allows you to recall specific information about anything for a brief period. Short-term memory is not as fleeting as sensory memory, but it’s also not as permanent as long-term memory. Short-term memory is also known as primary or active memory.

Research estimates that short-term memories only last for about 30 seconds. When you read a line in a book or a string of numbers that you have to recall, that’s your short-term memory at work.

You can keep information in your short-term memory by rehearsing the information. For example, if you need to recall a string of numbers, you might keep repeating them to yourself until you input them. However, if you are asked to recall those numbers about 10 minutes after inputting them, you’d most likely be unable to. 

## Working Memory

Working memory is a type of memory that involves the immediate and small amount of information that a person actively uses as they perform cognitive tasks.

While some experts view working memory as a fourth distinct type of memory, working memory can fall under the classification of short-term memory and, in many cases, is even used interchangeably. 

## Long-term Memory

## Why Do We Have Different Types of Memory?

Each different type of memory we have is important, and they all have various functions. Your short-term memory allows you to process and understand the information in an instant. When you read a paragraph in a book and understand it, that’s your short-term memory at work. 

Your most treasured and important memories are held in your long-term memory. Your long-term memory facilitates how to walk, talk, ride a bike, and engage in daily activities. It also allows you to recall important dates and facts.

In your day-to-day activities, you are bound to find yourself relying on your long-term memory the most. From waking up and brushing your teeth to getting on the right bus to commute to work, recalling all of these steps is facilitated by your long-term memory. 

## How Are Memories Made?

Memories are made in three distinct stages. It starts with encoding. Encoding is the way external stimuli and information make their way into your brain. This could occur through any of your five senses.

The next stage is storage, where the information we take in is stored either briefly, like with sensory and short term memory, or more permanently, like with long term memory.

The final stage is recall. Recall is our ability to retrieve the memory we’ve made from where it is stored. These processes are also how sensory memory might be turned into short-term memory or short-term memory into long-term memory.
