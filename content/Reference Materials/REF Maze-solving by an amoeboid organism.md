# Maze-solving by an Amoeboid Organism

## Summary

> An amoeboid organism called *Physarum polycephalum* was placed in a maze with four possible routes to get to two food sources. The organism's pseudopodia explored all possible connections until a single thick pseudopodium spanning the minimum length between the nutrient-containing agar blocks was formed. The path through the shortest distance between the food sources was always selected. The plasmodium changes its shape in the maze to form one thick tube covering the shortest distance between the food sources, showing a primitive intelligence.

We took a growing tip of an appropriate size from a large plasmodium in a 25 × 35 cm culture trough and divided it into small pieces. We then positioned these in a maze created by cutting a plastic film and placing it on an agar surface. The plasmodial pieces spread and coalesced to form a single organism that filled the maze ([Fig. 1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#Fig1)), avoiding the dry surface of the plastic film. At the start and end points of the maze, we placed 0.5 × 1 × 2 cm agar blocks containing nutrient (0.1 mg g−1 of ground oat flakes). There were four possible routes (α1, α2, β1, β2) between the start and end points ([Fig. 1a](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#Fig1)).

Plasmodium wet weight, 90 ± 10 mg. Yellow, plasmodium; black, ‘walls’ of the maze; scale bar, 1 cm. **d,** Path selection. Numbers indicate the frequency with which each pathway was selected. ‘None’, no pseudopodia (tubes) were put out.

The plasmodium pseudopodia reaching dead ends in the labyrinth shrank ([Fig. 1b](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#Fig1)), resulting in the formation of a single thick pseudopodium spanning the minimum length between the nutrient-containing agar blocks ([Fig. 1c](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#Fig1)). The exact position and length of the pseudopodium was different in each experiment, but the path through α2 — which was about 22% shorter than that through α1 — was always selected ([Fig. 1d](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#Fig1)). About the same number of tubes formed through β1 and β2 as the difference (about 2%) in their path lengths is lost in the meandering of the tube trajectory and is within experimental error.

The addition of food leads to a local increase in the plasmodium's contraction frequency, initiating waves propagating towards regions of lower frequency[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR1 "Durham, A. C. & Ridgeway, E. B. J. Cell Biol. 69 , 218–223 (1976)."),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR2 "Matsumoto, K., Ueda, T. & Kobatake, Y. J. Theor. Biol. 122, 339– 345 (1986)."),[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR3 "Miyake, Y., Tada, H., Yano, M. & Shimizu, H. Cell Struct. Funct.  19, 363–370 ( 1994)."),[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR4 "Nakagaki, T., Yamada, H. & Ito, M.  J. Theor. Biol. 197, 497–506 (1999)."),[5](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR5 "Yamada, H., Nakagaki, T. & Ito, M. Phys. Rev. E 59, 1009– 1014 (1999)."), in accordance with the theory of phase dynamics[6](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR6 "Kuramoto, Y. in  Chemical Oscillations, Waves and Turbulence (Springer, Berlin, 1984)."). The plasmodial tube is reinforced or decays when it lies parallel or perpendicular, respectively, to the direction of local periodic contraction[7](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR7 "Nakagaki, T., Yamada, H. & Ueda, T. Biophys. Chem. 84, 195– 204 (2000)."); the final tube, following the wave propagation, will therefore link food sites by the shortest path.

To maximize its foraging efficiency, and therefore its chances of survival, the plasmodium changes its shape in the maze to form one thick tube covering the shortest distance between the food sources. This remarkable process of cellular computation implies that cellular materials can show a primitive intelligence[8](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR8 "Sepulchre, J. A., Babloyantz, A. & Steels, L. in Proc. Int. Conf. on Artificial Neural Networks (eds Kohonen, T. et al.) 1265–1268 (Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1991)."),[9](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR9 "Sepulchre, J. A. & Babloyantz, A. Phys. Rev. E 48, 187–195 (1993)."),[10](https://www.nature.com/articles/35035159#ref-CR10 "Steinbock, O., Tóth, Á. & Showalter, K. Science 267, 868 –871 (1995).").
