# Meaning and Purpose in Life and Work - Arthur C. Brooks

## Personal and linked notes

From my quick scan of the transcript, it seems like they say that people who are able to do this delayed gratification are able to find meaning or [[Grow by practicing gratefulness towards tasks and behaviors|finding joy in accomplishing tasks]].
