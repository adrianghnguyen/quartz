# Exploring the Transit-oriented Development Level of HK

 #status/postponed

## Personal notes

- Hong-Kong is often held up as one of the primary shining examples of [[Transit-oriented development|transit-oriented development]]. This paper serves to examine how we can assess this in more objective terms through multiple measures.
  - I'll come back to this time sometime.

> ## 5. Conclusion
>
> As mentioned at the very beginning, Hong Kong is well-known for its TOD due to its successful integration of transit connectivity and land use. However, the past doesn't equal the future. Only focusing on station level TOD is not comprehensive enough to seek the loophole of the current planning system. Therefore, a strategic and regional level method to evaluate Hong Kong's TOD situation should be promoted to help planners and policymakers to make decisions precisely and efficiently.
>
> -   **_What are the criteria and indicators for evaluating regional TOD level of Hong Kong?_**
> -   This study selected 5 criteria and 12 indicators for evaluating regional TOD level of Hong Kong. For criteria, they are "Urban Density", "Land Use Diversity", "Design", "Destination Accessibility" and "Distance to Transit". For indicators, they are "Population Density", "Employment Density", "Building Density", "POIs Mixedness", "Length of Pedestrian Road", "Intersection of the Roads", "Topography", "The Mixedness of Residential and Other Land Use", "Accessibility to POIs", "Accessibility to Public Transit" and "Accessibility to MTR Station"
> -   **_How to integrate different indicators of regional TOD level with different units into a comparable potential TOD index? What is the function of the TOD index?_**
> -   AHP is used to normalize the unit of different indicators. SMCA approach is adopted to merge different criteria and indicators together for the formulation of the TOD index for the whole Hong Kong. The TOD index can both help to identify the distribution and needs of regional as well as station level TOD. The TOD index helps urban planners and policymakers to have a clear and all-rounded understanding of the TOD situation of Hong Kong in whichÂ they can make plans to enhance the TOD level and transit connectivity to the targeted places more quickly and precisely.
> -   **_Based on the potential TOD index, what can it reveal about the whole TODness of Hong Kong? Where is good at both transit connectivity and TOD attributes? Where requires more improvement for transit connectivity and TOD attributes?_**
> -   In general, places near the MTR stations have a higher TOD index. Most of the MTR stations are located within the area with a statistically significant TOD hotspot and cluster. However, there are 8 exceptions, including Heng Fa Chuen, Lohas Park Station, Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau, Sunny Bay, Disneyland Resort, Airport and AsiaWorld-Expo. As six of them are serving for specific purposes, hence, only Heng Fa Chuen and Lohas Park Station are located in the grids without a statistically significant TOD hotspot and cluster. The located area of these two stations is said to be the possible places to enhance their TOD characteristics. For the overlay of 800m service area of MTR stations with statistically significant hotspot and cluster, the service area of Mongkok, Sham Shui Po and Prince Edward Stations have relatively good performance in integrating both TOD characteristics and transit connectivity, while the service area of Fo Tan, Heng Fa Chuen and Wong Chuk Hang Stations require more efforts to improve their TOD attributes. For places away from the 800m MTR service area but are statistically significant TOD hotspots and clusters, they are the possible sites to be chosen to enhance their transit connectivity.
