> [!Warning] Reference note
> > The Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver provides guidance for the planning, design, implementation, maintenance, and monitoring of bikeways, through a rapid implementation lens. This guide focuses on treatments using flexible, low-cost materials that are implemented rapidly within the existing roadway and with minimal physical construction requirements. It expands on existing guidance (see below) and includes practical planning and design support for local governments, Indigenous communities, senior levels of government, and other agency staff in Metro Vancouver and beyond. The Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver features case studies from communities within Vancouver and around the world, as well as lessons learned.
