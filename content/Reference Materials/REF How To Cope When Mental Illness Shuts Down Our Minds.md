> [!note] AI Summary on [[2023-10-27]]
> The text discusses the concept and perceived notions of mental illness. It emphasizes the fact that from an inside perspective, mental illness is perceived as a continuous, intensive, relentless process of thinking, filled with self-disgust, negative self-reflection, pondering fearsome scenarios, questioning self-worth, and contemplating ending one's life. This continuous 'hive of activity', as it is described, seems like an extreme act of thinking.
>
> However, for the sake of kindness and redemption, it is suggested that this intense activity does not qualify as 'thinking', but rather as symptoms of illness. Mental Illness is portrayed as a flood of negatively intense feelings that disrupt the higher faculties - the capacity to discriminate, find perspective, assess danger appropriately, plan realistically for the future, determine risks and distinguish opportunities, and most importantly, the ability to be kind and generous to oneself.
>
> The most [[Mental illness insists that the brain is still healthy|cruel aspect of mental illness]], according to the text, is that there is no clear indication or alert of one's deteriorating mental health. The mind, even whilst distorted, continually assures that it's providing normal readings and that all the excessive worrying and anxiety are a genuine part of reality. This state of distorted thinking is compared to terrorists impersonating prestigious scientists, laying out vicious theories and prognoses.
>
> However, with cycles of distorted thinking and recovery, it is eventually suggested acceptance of the fact that one can occasionally lose command over the higher faculties. It is important to acknowledge and handle this situation carefully as it is a part of the mental illness. Practical steps are recommended such as rest, music, balneotherapy, minimal mental activity, watching easy shows on TV, and accessing external help from a trusted friend or therapist for recalibration and regulation of thoughts.
>
> The text finally concludes that contrary to a common perception, which assumes as long as one is conscious, one's mind is working optimally, the reality is much more complex. Mental illness can teach us that our higher faculties are extremely vulnerable—prone to shut down under the sway of our emotional complexities—and they can do so without any warning. Thus, it is important to recognize when we are no longer able to think.
