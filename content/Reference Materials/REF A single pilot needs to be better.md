# A Single Pilot Needs to Be Better

 #status/postponed

The part which stood out to me was that sometimes 1 + 1 sometimes does not equal 2. It forces American US pilots to trust their sense and practice hard at becoming the best, because there's no acceptance for failure - as it means life or death

- Can we relate this to [[The impossibility of conveying objective truth]] which focuses on mathematics?

> Computers and automation have made the physical act of flying (via fly by wire and advanced and very redundant Flight Control Computers) to the pilot extremely easy. Even max performing my aircraft, the F/A-18E, in BFM isn't particularly difficult to "fly" allowing me to focus on my tactics, defenses, and weapons opportunities. For more benign stuff, I can dedicate my attention to my weapons, sensors, etc. And that's where technology and computers help me out as well. Most people's only exposure to modern combat interfaces is sims like DCS, and that is woefully out of date. It's actually very easy to "fight" my jet, and a lot of time and effort goes into making this even easier.

> Now, where does a second person come in? So back in the old days, computers weren't there, and you needed a dedicated RIO or WSO to manipulate the radar, program, the weapons, and so on. But that is so simple these days that it's no longer necessary in Western air forces. Some countries like the redundancy, but most (and the future) embrace single seat. Like, there's literally nothing a two seat F/A-18F can do that a single seat F/A-18E cannot. And I get 1000lbs extra of gas. Eastern aircraft aren't quite "there" yet in terms of automation, especially for air to surface weapons, hence they're more likely to have a second seat to focus on this.

> So why is a second seat in A/A less ideal? Well, for one, we get back to "not needed" in terms of interface. For another, 1+1 rarely equals 2, and in fact, a bad WSO actually degrades the SA of an otherwise good pilot, and vice versa. A good crew still works well, but I don't need to worry about another person's opinion on how to respond to a situation. I can just do it. This forces me to "be better." It is a weird concept, but across the US military, you'll see single seat guys do better A/A than two seat, and like you correctly pointed out, the future is single seat. Like an F-35 guy has way more to comprehend, process, and think about than I do, and yet he's still fully capable of doing it single seat.

> *Because this always comes up, F-15E guys are weird and like WSOs because they're half-WSO. But there's no shortage of F/A-18F pilots who would rather be E drivers, and yet I have never met an E guy that wishes the opposite. But that aircraft is more bomber than it is fighter, and I will die on this hill.
