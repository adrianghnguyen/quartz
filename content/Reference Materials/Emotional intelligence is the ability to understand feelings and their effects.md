# Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and their effects

> [!NOTE] What is emotional intelligence?
> Emotional intelligence is the *ability to understand feelings* and how they *shape thoughts and actions*. People high in emotional intelligence (often referred to as a high EQ) are able to perceive their own feelings as well as that of others.

## Reflections on emotional intelligence

I remember reading the book [[Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman|Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman]] when I had dropped out of ECE and was debating what to do next. It was a pretty formative moment as it helped understand one my natural talents which is to develop [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|deep empathy]] and being pretty adept at identifying [[Identify the emotion you are feeling with a feelings chart|other's feelings]].

If I had to think back to my childhood, [[Tran Huynh|my mother]] could sometimes be [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|volatile with her emotions]] and trying to understand what she was feeling, this was a skill which needed to be practiced. Perhaps it was unsurfaced [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] and anger after my [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|father's]] passing.

Interestingly enough, one of the [[Cultural roots of shame|cultural messages of shame]] which was perpetuated was that I was too sensitive or I '*thought too much*'. Culturally, Vietnamese (and perhaps general Asian culture) teaches us that emotions are something to be suppressed or [[Emotional suppression and denial|dismissed]].

But you know? Even though shit kinda sucked, I feel like I learned some valuable skills such as [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|better communication]], empathy, and  [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|ability to better deal with my emotional outbursts]].

Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand feelings and how they shape thoughts and actions. People high in emotional intelligence (often referred to as a high EQ) are able to perceive their own feelings as well as that of others. They can anticipate how their actions may affect other people. Equally important, they also have a greater understanding of the series of emotions and actions that might have led the person in front of them to be where they are at a decision. They can also use this understanding of their own and others’ emotions to make decisions about what actions to take, recognizing that different people will react differently.

> ## 7 skills that improve when you develop emotional intelligence:
>
> -   **Listening.** People with high EQ are great listeners. They are able to understand what is — and isn’t — being said.
> -   **Communication.** Those that are emotionally aware use more specific language to describe their feelings. This makes it easier for them to ask for and receive help.
> -   **Relationship building.** Because people love to be around those with high emotional intelligence, they have an easier time developing relationships. They intrinsically understand the needs of others.
> -   **Resilience.** Since high EQ people are more aware of their emotions and triggers, they tend to [manage stress more effectively](https://www.betterup.com/blog/stress-management-techniques?hsLang=en) and have a more consistent emotional baseline.
> -   **[[Non-violent communication to resolve conflicts|Conflict resolution]].** Unsurprisingly, a better handle on emotions and how your actions impact others [leads to smoother conflict resolution](https://www.betterup.com/blog/team-conflict?hsLang=en).
> -   **Decision making.** Higher EQ often means a deep connection to [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values]]. This makes decision-making easier and more intuitive.
> -   **Leadership.** Because they seem more emotionally stable, [better able to utilize feedback](https://www.betterup.com/blog/receiving-feedback?hsLang=en), and skilled in working with others, emotionally intelligent people are often standout choices for leadership roles.
> ## 4 ingredients of emotional intelligence:
>
> **1. Self awareness**
>
> Can you describe what you’re good at, what you need to work on, what triggers you, or how you’re feeling right now? The ability to assess and express your emotions, strengths, and weaknesses is at the core of self awareness. Self awareness is strongly related to self confidence. Those that understand their feelings, motivations, and strengths are more confident and more likely to take chances.
>
> **2. Self management**
>
> A large part of self management is emotional control, which has obvious implications for the workplace. People tend to dislike working with individuals who are prone to emotional outbursts. These effects are magnified at work, but are no less damaging in personal relationships. Emotionally volatile relationships can become dangerous, and [numerous studies have documented the ill effects of emotionally inconsistent parenting](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29444521_The_Effects_of_Inconsistent_Parenting_on_the_Development_of_Uncertain_Self-Esteem_and_Depression_Vulnerability).
>
> **3. Social awareness**
>
> Ever walked into a room and immediately known that something was wrong? That “vibe” you read is social awareness at work. The information you receive while interacting with others is important in helping you determine how to behave — and how that behavior will be received. You may not be consciously paying much attention to it, but in any conversation you make dozens of small adjustments to your tone, speed, volume, gestures, and pitch based on the cues you receive. 
>
> **4. Relationship management**
>
> If you’re responsible for leading or managing a team, relationship management is possibly the attribute that is most directly related to your success. This trait is about your ability to inspire, motivate, encourage, and influence others. Effective teamwork is highly correlated to relationship management. Because this skill is so critical, many organizations prioritize training in this area of emotional intelligence.

> ## 4 strategies to improve emotional intelligence 
> #### **1. Build self-awareness**
>
> One of the key attributes of emotionally intelligent people is the ability to recognize and manage their own emotions. By far, the single most important thing you can do to build emotional intelligence is to develop an awareness of [how your feelings and triggers drive your behavior](https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-is-emotional-well-being?hsLang=en). This kind of work isn’t easy, and can even be painful. Working with a coach or therapist can help you understand yourself with compassion.
>
> **_Action step:_** _Label your emotions as specifically as you possibly can. Instead of settling for annoyed or angry, try disappointed, frustrated, threatened, anxious, or apprehensive. Does another “label” feel more true?_ 
>
> **2. Embrace constructive conflict**
>
> Conflict is rarely comfortable, especially in the workplace. We tend to unilaterally see it as a negative. However, [constructive conflicts](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-embrace-constructive-conflict?hsLang=en) can foster camaraderie, reduce groupthink, and encourage growth. Reframing conflict as a necessary part of a thriving workplace, and recognizing that the other party may not perceive it as negatively as you do, can help you feel less threatened when it arises. For example, for some people, friction and [[Misunderstanding often comes from mismatched expectations|disagreement]] is a sign of respect for you as a professional, taking ideas seriously, and  the importance of the stakes. Conflict is a means to reach better answers.
>
> **_Action step:_** _Practice [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|taking responsibility]]. Many people shy away from conflict and feedback because they don’t want to feel as if they did something wrong. However, conflict doesn’t have to be about right or wrong. It is about seeing a situation through another perspective and learning from it. Without focusing on blame, you can always decide to be part of improving a difficult situation._
>
> **3. Withhold judgement**
>
> It’s a common adage that we judge ourselves on our intentions, while we judge others on their actions. When something happens at work that doesn’t go the way you’d like, take your gut reaction “to trial.” Did this person really do something _to_ you, or are you just concerned about the outcome? How can you understand the decisions they made in a different way?
>
> **_Action step:_** _Ask yourself, “Under what circumstances would I have made the same decision?” Changing perspective and putting yourself in the driver’s seat will help you build empathy and regain your sense of control._
>
> **4. Become a world-class listener**
>
> Emotional intelligence, [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|like any other skill]], benefits from practice. Work with your team to roleplay potentially difficult situations and how you would respond. Talking through these scenarios in a neutral setting will inevitably provide insight into the real concerns your team has. Practice doesn’t always make perfect, but it does make for more compassionate leaders.
>
> **_Action step:_** _The next time you’re in a conversation, notice if you’re listening for understanding or listening to respond. Challenge yourself to hear what the other person is saying, and then respond by rephrasing back to them. By listening carefully, you may catch more than what they said._
>
> Developing emotional intelligence is about more than feelings or being a good listener. As you grow more comfortable with communication and understanding how emotions drive behavior, you’ll find yourself less frustrated, more resilient, and better able to embrace conflict when it arises. Learning to be at home with a variety of experiences and perspectives is at the heart of improving emotional intelligence.
