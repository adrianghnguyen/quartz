It's a guide provided by [[The organization 80 000 hours|the organization 80,000 Hours]] which is a summation of the next steps for [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] and finding out what I want [[My career reflections and planning|my career journey]] to look like. It'll help me find my [[Career fit is about finding the right career|personal fit when it comes to a career]] and point me the right direction in terms of [[Think like a scientist by embracing experimentation|experimentation]].

It's a more [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|systematic framework]] for minimizing risks as I seek out [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]] when it comes to my career.

## 1. Your key criteria for a fulfilling career

> [!info]
> We argue there are [[Traits defining great work|six ingredients to aim to find in a dream job]] long-term:
> - work that helps others
> - that you’re good at
> - that's engaging
> - done with supportive colleagues
> - meets your basic needs
> - which fits enough with your personal life.
>
> But it’s useful to further personalise these, so now write out the 4-8 factors that are most important to you in a dream job.
>
> If you’re not sure, ask yourself:
> - What have you found most / least fulfilling in the past?
> - What did those situations have in common?
> - If you were going to die in ten years, how would you spend your time?
> - What does your ideal work day look like, hour-by-hour?
>
> And see the additional exercises in the article on what makes for a dream job.

1. Where my work contributes towards improving mental health? I want to know that we're not creating 'bullshit work'
2. The organisation has a clear mission and lives up to its own values
3. A mixture of work that involves technical skill development as well as non-technical skills (I like to understand technical system)
4. Opportunity to contribute to organisational improvement and have an impact (I like finding out how we can improve how we work 
6. I work as an individual contributor but there are supportive resources/colleagues for when I feel stuck. Unsure about this one.
7. There is an organisational openness towards not knowing how to solve a problem and working together rather than bullying
8. Bureaucracy is not an overall limiting factor. People are engaged to solve problems.

How do they related to [[My core values define what matters|my core values]] and [[My personal strengths|my personal strengths]]? I need to review this list.

## 2. Optional: Your starting position

### 2.1. Optional: What's the most valuable career capital you already have?

> [!info]
> The aim is to get good at something that helps others, so it’s helpful to pause on what you might already have to offer.
>
> Consider your:
> - Skills and knowledge
> - Connections
> - Credentials (e.g. degrees, achievements, public projects)
> - Character (e.g. conscientiousness)
> - Runway (i.e. how long you could live without income)
>
> List the top 5 most valuable elements of your career capital
>
> If you're stuck, list out the five achievements you're most proud of and ask what they have in common.

1. Strong in project management, communication and process improvement
2. Who do I have connections to?
	1. People in high finance
	2. Management consulting
	3. Software/tech people
	4. Maybe my dad knows people
	5. Vietnamese community
	6. People in academia
3. Easy time getting along with new people
4. Mixture of knowledge in people (psychology + HR), business, and technology
5. Ability to think abstractly, do research and digest difficult concepts thanks to my [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|associative thinking]]
6. Technical competencies in analytics/data. Slightly weak in programming.

Things for which I was most proud of:
- Doing well in business cases despite lack of formal experience - synthesizing complex information, critical thinking
- Driving projects which led to organizational process improvement affecting how many people work
- Working well with others + leadership
- T-shaped knowledge? I consider myself a [[Being a generalist means having a broad set of skills and interests|generalist]].
- Possibly learning software well?
	- going through the bootcamp
	- When given something, figuring out a solution?
- I think I'm pretty good at diving into new subjects

### 2.2. Optional: What might you be able to get good at?

> [!info]
> Write down any further thoughts you have about what skills or roles you have the potential to be best at based on your reflections and life experience so far. If you’d like to reflect in more depth, see the article on [[Career fit is about finding the right career|personal fit]] and our article on finding your strengths.

> [!question] Maybe go back and think outside the box - really broaden the horizon and think outside a specific lens and desired outcome
>

- Writing documentation
- Researching mental health
- I've been suggested that I may become a good technical product manager since I understand how to work with people but also have some understanding of technical software
- Understanding individual people's behaviours - I've been suggested multiple times if I considered becoming a psychologist/therapist
- Researching and collecting difficult topics to try and understand them
- Cooking and developing recipes
- Working in the food industry
- Urbanism…?
- Working in the finance industry? Financial analyst?
- Organization-building

## 3. Global problems

### 3.1. Which global problems do you think are most pressing?

> [!info]
> Given what you’ve learned so far, write out your current list of the 2–5 most pressing global problems for you to work on. Don’t worry if you feel very uncertain — especially early in your career, it’s fine to focus mainly on building skills and figure out how to deploy them later. Though, it’s worth thinking seriously about this question at some point, especially before making big commitments.
>
> Example: great power conflict, nuclear war, pandemics, risks from advanced AI.
>
> If you’d like to think about this further, there are two broad approaches:
> 1. Find someone whose judgement you trust and use their views as a starting point (adjusting based on your values). If that’s us (!), see our list.
> 2. Do your own research. We have a short guide.

- Top choice
	- Mental health - see also [[The mental illness epidemic is a global problem|global mental health crisis]] and [[My career mission|my career mission]]
- Important
	- Artificial sentience - see also [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|AI in mental healthcare]]
	- Urbanism and how we can create a more cohesive society - ties in with climate change IMO. See also [[MOC Urbanism and urban planning|Content hub for Urbanism and Urban planning]]
	- Climate change
- Passive interest
	- Financial system breakdown
	- Information wars and disinformation leading to political instability
	- Whole brain emulation
	- Promoting positive values
	- Improving decision-making
	- Improving individual reasoning and cognition

I should consider what's best in terms of [[Career fit is about finding the right career|personal fit for my career]].

## 4. Longer-term career paths to aim towards

> [!info]
> The aim of this section is to have a shortlist of longer-term career roles you’d most like to aim towards. When combined with your list of problems, this comprises [[Vision as deep personal expression|your ‘vision.’]]

### 4.1. Make a long list of ideas

> [!info]
> Start by making a long list of ideas. These could range from broad skillsets (e.g. economist or software engineer), or specific jobs (e.g. think tank researcher working on the impacts of AI) — generally getting more specific later in your career. Typically, they’re options you’ll aim towards over 3–20 years.
>
> Here are some prompts to help generate ideas:
> - For each category of impactful career, try to generate 1–2 options within each you might pursue: building organisations, communication and community building, government and policy, earning to give, research, etc. Also, see our list of career reviews and note down any other ideas there.
> - For the global problems you listed earlier, what do they most need (you see some thinking about this question in our problem profiles)? Can you think of any career paths you might be able to take that could help address those needs?
> - Given what you wrote in section two, which paths or skillsets do you think you might be able to get good at?
> - Which paths might best meet your criteria for a satisfying job from section one? If money were no object, what would you do?
> - Might you be able to combine any of the above to get the best of both worlds?
> - What would a wise friend say you should do? (Maybe ask one.)
>
> List your ideas for longer-term career paths

This is brainstorming to help me think of potential paths to help me build [[Career capital|career capital]] and help gain [[Career capital|rare and valuable skills]]. I've saved a link to the [[Career tracks define long-term advancement paths|evaluation of these career paths]] and it's probably something I'll need to re-examine every few years to determine if I'm still on the right track in terms of [[Career fit is about finding the right career|career fit]].

	- 1.1 Data Analyst/Business Analyst
	- 1.2 Behavioral Data Analyst
	- 1.3 Predictive Modeling Analyst
	- 1.4 A/B Testing Specialist
	- 1.5 Data Scientist

12. Non-profit or governmental organization
	1. To investigate

### 4.2. Make a rough guess at which 2–7 longer-term paths are most promising

> [!info]
> Given what you know now, weigh them up on the balance of impact, potential personal fit, and your other criteria for a fulfilling career. Again, it’s OK if you feel very uncertain — we’ll come back to how to further investigate your options later, and it’s even possible to push ahead without this list.

These are all various longer-term career path I could follow. I should consider this when I think about what [[Career tracks define long-term advancement paths|career track]] may best fit me.

1. Product manager in tech (3 votes for this)
2. Data analyst -> Data scientist
3. [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|NLP (Natural Language Processing) technology]] [[Graduate school|graduate study]] such as a PhD or Master's
4. Researcher in mental health tech
5. Software engineer
6. Early stage employee
7. Counseling psychologist
8. Project management

Early stage employee may be able to be combined in some of those roles.

## 5. Next steps

> [!info]
> The previous sections have focused on what to aim for longer term. This section is about the immediate next step you need to take, typically over 1–3 years.

### 5.1. Which career stage is the best match for you?

> [!info]
> Select the priority that seems most important right now:
> - Exploring to find your fit
> - Building career capital towards a particular longer-term path (but with a back-up plan)
> - Deploying your existing career capital
> - Other (e.g. building transferable career capital with the intention to clarify your plan later)
>
> Write your current career stage, and why you chose it

Building my career capital seems to be the stage which is most appropriate in terms of career stages and exploring it.

### 5.2. Generate options for your next step

> [!info]
> First, clarify the next step you need to take. Then again, the aim is to generate a long list of options for that step. Here are some questions to use:
> - Work backwards: given what you’d most like to do longer term, which next steps would most accelerate you on that path? Or how could you test out that option?
> - Work forwards: are you aware of any opportunities that could be interesting, or where you might excel, even if you’re not sure where they’ll lead?
> - What jobs could you take that would generally boost your career capital? See our list of categories.
> - Skim over our job board, and note any interesting opportunities.
>
> List your ideas here (try to get to at least 10, the more the better)

> [!warning] This step is very unclear - would like to hear feedback
>
> [Planning the next steps](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/#spend-longer-planning-your-next-steps) information
>
> Advice for this section:
> - Think how I can test to eliminate an option
> - Focus on what core skills I would need to succeed on a particular [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career paths]] by developing a model of success
> - Get personal advice my network
> - Are there any opportunities, areas to learn about, side projects, or people you feel especially excited about right now?
> - Is anything you’re doing right now going better than expected? Could you spend more of your time on that?

I think what's interesting about this exercise is that it helps engage the [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|Hope circuit]] by [[Say yes more often to embrace opportunities|keeping an open mind to new opportunities]] and imagining possible options.

## 6. Sketch your A/B/Z plan

> [!info]
> Now, let’s make an initial guess at how to tie everything together. In the next section, we’ll cover how and whether to further investigate your plan.

### 6.1. Your Plan A

> [!info]
> Your Plan A is the plan you’d most like to pursue. Typically, it’ll be a combination of a longer-term role (+ problem(s) it'll help with) you’d like to aim towards and the best next step towards that. (Though, it could also be a plan to try out several longer-term paths to find your fit or build transferable career capital.)
>
> Your Plan A is your best guess at the route you’d most like to pursue.
>
> This could be a particular vision you’re going to bet on, and the next step that would imply.
>
> For example: _Try to become an academic economist who works on global priorities research or AI policy (vision) by studying these extra maths courses at undergrad (next step)._
>

### 6.2. Your Plan B

> [!info]
> Your options for Plan B are promising alternatives to your Plan A that you can switch into if Plan A doesn’t work out.

#### 6.2.1. Why is Plan A most likely to not work out?

- Lack of motivation to finish/Turns out coding sucks ass
- Might not have background knowledge to break into the industry/cutting-edge
- Research type role might require specific academic credentials such as that of [[Graduate school|graduate school]]
- Might not get in the recurse center
- Unable to find suitable programming curriculum
- Might not have enough competencies to apply for roles
- No job opportunity suitable for my competencies out there for [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|AI in mental health tech]]

#### 6.2.2. What are some good Plan B options you could take in that case?

- Investigate [[product management]]? Would need to build up career capital from scratch
- Apply to [[Graduate school|graduate school]] for a professional master's in a specific topic
	- Consider [[Schools Offering Post-graduate Programs in Cognitive Science|universities with cognitive science programs]]
- Go back into analytics type role
	- data analyst/analytics engineer
- Coding bootcamp?
- Apply to other type of role in [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|AI in mental healthcare]]
	- business/operations/?????

### 6.3. Your Plan Z

> [!info]
> If all of the above goes wrong, what will you do? Writing this in advance makes it easier to take risks — e.g. could you move in with your family or go back to your old job?
>
> Write out 1–3 Plan Z options
>
> If your plan Z isn’t acceptable, consider changing your plan A to focus on putting yourself in a better position.

- Take part-time job in Montreal to cover the bills
- Move back in with my parents and focus on building up skills
- Pick up a random tech job or any other role which may not align with my goals while I go back to the drawing board

#### 6.4. Optional: more risk management

> [!info]
> What’s the realistic worst-case scenario if you pursue the plan above? How can you make that less likely to happen? If it does happen, how will you cope?
>
> OK, you’ve done the hard work. There’s just a little more to finish off. Before we go on, take a break…

- The worst case scenario is that there is nothing for me at the end of the pursuit.
- I can rely on my parents' money and my financial nest egg to help me tide over while I redevelop a new plan
- I'll probably face a lot of psychological difficulties the experience not working out. Instead I should consider this as part of the [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|lifelong journey of discovery]] and see the experience as an [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failure]]. It'll be a good time to revisit these note at that time.

## 7. Investigate your plan

### 7.1. Rank your key uncertainties

> [!info]
> Go through each section above, especially your lists of problems, longer-term paths, and next steps, and think about the key uncertainties in each of these lists. Roughly rank them in terms of (i) which are easiest to resolve and (ii) which would most change your plan if resolved.
>
> Example: if you require a certain level of pay, can you eliminate jobs that pay less than that?

1. What skillsets do I actually need to succeed in this role?
	1. Look for roles which resemble what I may enjoy and list out their common requirements
2. Would I enjoy the industry? What roles exist within it?
	1. Interview people working in the field I want and ask them what they think is needed
3. Would I enjoy work in that industry? How can I tell?
	1. I tihnk I've always been passionate about mental health and psychology
4. Would I enjoy the potential work of a software engineer?
	1. Test out by doing projects
5. How can I stay accountable to my deadlines?
	1. Talk to my friends and family and learn to [[Share your journey publicly|make public commitments by sharing work publicly]]
6. Does building my project help me gather further career capital?
	1. Find projects which target the direct skillsets which I need to develop for this [[Career tracks define long-term advancement paths|career track]]
7. What if there are no opportunities out there for me?
	1. Research the state of the industry and see if opportunities exist (realistically, mental health isn't going away anytime soon)
	2. Talk to the [[The organization 80 000 hours|80,000 Hours]] advisors and ask them for their take
8. How much money and what lifestyle am I willing to compromise on in my pursuit?
	1. Develop a financial budget from the ground up and review what do I *truly* need to be happy in terms of lifestyle - cast aside ego and need for luxuries
9. Do I have confidence in my plan?

### 7.2. Step back and reflect on your plan

> [!abstract]
> Now’s a good time to consider your plan as a whole and see if you can spot further issues or uncertainties.
>
> Go to next section.

#### 7.2.1. How do you feel about your plan?

> [!info]
> Although you shouldn’t ‘go with your gut,’ if your gut feels uneasy, it’s very important to understand why.

- I feel like it provides a solid template of what I need to focus on next.
- I'm not sure if I trust myself to follow through - I am afraid of myself for not following through.
- The next sets of actions need to become more concrete.

#### 7.2.2. How are you most likely to be wrong about your plan?

> [!info]
> Asking yourself (and ideally other people) this question is one of the most powerful ways to reduce bias in your thinking.

- Might be worth doing a checkpoint every 2 months to evaluate the progress of my plan and consider alternatives. Consider what went well - what didn't.
	- I have probably failed to consider alternative paths to get to my end goal
	- I probably underestimated the timeline in my career - humans are not very good at estimating the time it takes to complete a task.
	- I'll gain more information by trying projects and talking to the companies/people.
- Have I considered paths which might maximize my current strengths rather than chasing somewhere where I may have a further back [[REF How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why#^62057d|starting point]]?
- Am I chasing what other people have implanted as [[Personal meaning of success and what I care about in life|my definition of success]] or am I chasing some version of the [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|the Four Idols of Thomas Aquinas]]?

> [!Danger] Ask for feedback from friends about the plan

### 7.3. Make a plan to investigate your key uncertainties

> [!info]
> Start with the cheapest ways to gain information. For example, you could start by reading relevant career reviews or problem profiles and then decide to talk to people in an area. If you want to invest more, you could test out a project. Often the best way forward is just to apply to lots of jobs and see what offers you get.
>
> Does it seem worth further investigating any of these uncertainties, or should you just take a bet on your current plan? Career decisions often affect years of your life, so they are worth spending at least a few weeks researching. But, if you can’t see cheap ways to investigate more, it might be time to just try something for a few years.
>
> List actions you will take to investigate your key uncertainties

See [[REF 80,000 Hours - Career guide - Career planning template#7.1. Rank your key uncertainties]]

### 7.4. Get some feedback

> [!info]
> Now is an especially good time to run your plan past someone else. One option is to send a copy of your whole plan to several friends and ask for them to comment. Another option is to approach people about specific uncertainties you’ve listed above.
>
> Now’s also a great time to go and meet some people in our community and talk to them about your plan (and if you haven’t yet applied to speak to our team one-on-one, you could do that now).

### 7.5. Update your plan and make an overall best guess

> [!info]
> Based on what you learn from investigation and feedback, update your earlier answers. You may not ever feel especially certain about your plan — but stop investigating when your best guess next steps stop changing dramatically.

### 7.6. Set a review point

> [!info]
> Is there an event coming up where you’ll gain a lot of information about your plan (e.g. exam results)? If not, by default, we recommend reviewing it roughly once a year (with the exact frequency depending on how much you’re learning and how fast the situation is changing).
