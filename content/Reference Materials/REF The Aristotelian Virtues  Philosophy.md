If the proper function (*telos* or *ergon*) of human persons *qua* rational animal is happiness (*eudaimonia*) or living well (*eu zÃªn*), then happiness is the activity of the rational soul In accordance with excellence, or virtue. Virtues are context appropriate means (the golden mean) between an excess and a deficit with respect to some action or emotion. Aristotle identifies at least the following, although we ought not take this to be an exhaustive list.
