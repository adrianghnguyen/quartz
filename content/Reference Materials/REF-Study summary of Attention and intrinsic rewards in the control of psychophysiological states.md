## Detailed Study Abstract

> The study "Attention and intrinsic rewards in the control of psychophysiological states" is a research article published in the journal, Biofeedback and Self-Regulation, in 1979. The study aimed to investigate the role of attention and intrinsic rewards in the regulation of psychophysiological states, specifically in the context of biofeedback training.
>
> The researchers proposed that biofeedback training, which involves the use of electronic monitoring devices to provide individuals with real-time feedback on their physiological responses (such as heart rate, muscle tension, or skin conductance), could be enhanced by the use of intrinsic rewards and attentional focusing strategies.
>
> To test this hypothesis, the researchers conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a biofeedback training group that received [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|extrinsic rewards]] (money) for achieving specific physiological goals, a biofeedback training group that received intrinsic rewards (positive feedback and encouragement) for achieving the same goals, or a control group that did not receive any feedback or rewards. The results showed that the group that received intrinsic rewards demonstrated better regulation of their physiological responses compared to the other groups.
>
> In the second experiment, the researchers examined the role of attentional focusing in biofeedback training. Participants were trained to focus their attention on specific physiological signals, and were then asked to regulate these signals using biofeedback training. The results showed that participants who were able to focus their attention on the physiological signals had better regulation of these signals compared to those who did not receive attentional training.
>
> **Overall, the study suggests that attentional focusing and intrinsic rewards can play an important role in the regulation of psychophysiological states, particularly in the context of biofeedback training. By using these strategies, individuals may be better able to control their physiological responses and achieve greater overall well-being.**^[ChatGPT]
