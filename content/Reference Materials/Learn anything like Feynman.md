# Learn anything like Feynman

## What is the Feynman technique?

> The Feynman Technique is a powerful [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]] for learning anything. The best entrepreneurs, investors, and thinkers have leveraged this technique—whether they know it or not! Their common genius: the ability to abstract complexity and convey ideas in simple, digestible ways.

### 1. Set the Stage

- What’s the topic you want to learn? **Starting with a blank page, write the topic at the top and jot down everything you know about it. Read & research the topic.** Step 1 sets the stage for the process.
- Add any new learnings or insights as you develop them.

This process is similar to gaining situation/environmental context. Only once do you understand your problem space can you begin determining a possible approach. This is similar to OODA loops ([[OODA Loop]]) but applied within learning contexts. We can only begin expanding our knowledge once we know our limits ([[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]).

### 2. ELI5 (Explain It To Me Like I'm 5)

- Attempt to explain the topic to a child—figuratively (or literally if you're ambitious!).
- On a new blank page, write down everything you know about your topic—but now pretend you are explaining it to a child.  **Use simple language!**

Learning to explain in simpler terms forces us to reconsider if we have the fundamentals ([[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]]) and develop new semantic connections between prior knowledge ([[Transform information into knowledge]]) and what we currently know in order to make meaning ([[Process information deeply to create knowledge]]).

### 3. Assess & Study

- Reflect on your performance—form an honest assessment.
- How well were you able to explain the topic to a child?
	- Where did you get frustrated? Where did you turn to jargon?
- These are the **gaps in your understanding! Read and study more to fill them**.

### 4. Organize, Convey & Review

- **Organize** your elegant, simple language into a clear, compelling story or narrative.
- **Test-and-Learn: Convey it to a few others, then iterate and refine accordingly.**
- Review your new, deep understanding of the topic. Remember: Simple=Beautiful

[[Spaced repetition is superior to rote memorization|Spaced repetition]] is a one of the techniques available to review information.

## The Feynman Technique from Farnam Street

If you want to supercharge your learning, the single most effective technique we’ve uncovered for absorbing new concepts comes from the famed Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. [The Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) ensures you understand what you learn. It includes the following four steps:

1. Choose a concept you wish to learn about.
2. Pretend you are teaching it to a child—a sixth-grader, specifically. Write your explanation down or say it out loud.
3. Identify any gaps in your understanding that might show up when you try to simplify the concept; go back to the source material to find the information you need.
4. Review and simplify your explanation again.

It works because writing out a concept [in language a child would understand](https://fs.blog/2016/07/mental-tools-richard-feynman/) forces you to understand it at a deeper level. Sometimes we use jargon and complicated language to hide what we don’t understand. The Feynman Technique lays bare the true extent of our knowledge.

Similarly, [asking better questions](https://fs.blog/2019/09/power-questions/) is a route to faster learning. The most mundane questions—the ones a sixth-grader might ask—can sometimes teach us the most because they require an explanation that digs into the details.

How do you know if you’ve truly learned a new concept? Feynman proposed a simple alternate test: [try to rephrase it in your own language without using its actual name](https://fs.blog/2016/07/richard-feynman-teaching-math-kids/). For instance, describe what enables a dog to run without using the word “energy.”
