# Meta-study: How Breath-Control Can Change Your Life A Systematic Review on Psycho-Physiological Correlates of Slow Breathing

## Personal Summary and Notes

See also [[Breathe slowly and take a deep breath]]

## Article Conclusions

> **Conclusions:**Â Slow breathing techniques act enhancing autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility in a scenario of mutual interactions: we found evidence of links between parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power), CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control and psychological well-being in healthy subjects. Our hypothesis considers two different mechanisms for explaining psychophysiological changes induced by voluntary control of slow breathing: one is related to a voluntary regulation of internal bodily states (enteroception), the other is associated to the role of mechanoceptors within the nasal vault in translating slow breathing in a modulation of olfactory bulb activity, which in turn tunes the activity of the entire cortical mantle.

- Slow breathing techniques provides multiple benefits such as brain, body and psychological flexibility
- Benefits seem to come from the following mechanisms:
	- parasympathetic activity (increased HRV and LF power)
	- CNS activities (increased EEG alpha power and decreased EEG theta power) related to emotional control ([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]) and psychological well-being in healthy subjects
- CNS = Central nervous power
- EEG alpha power is related to brain waves?

## Context of Study on Slow Breathing Mechanisms

Slow breathing has been used for centuries in traditional practices such as yoga and meditation to promote physical and emotional wellbeing. Recent research has investigated the psychophysiological effects of slow breathing, which involves taking less than 10 breaths per minute. This article reviews the current literature on the effects of slow breathing on various physiological systems, including the cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems.

## Observed Effects within Current Literature on the Effects of Slow Breathing

### Cardiovascular Effects

Slow breathing has been shown to have a positive effect on cardiovascular function. It can lower blood pressure, heart rate, and sympathetic nerve activity while increasing parasympathetic nerve activity. This results in improved heart rate variability (HRV), which is an indicator of cardiac autonomic control. Slow breathing also improves arterial baroreflex sensitivity, which helps regulate blood pressure.

### Respiratory Effects

Slow breathing can improve respiratory function by increasing tidal volume (the amount of air that is breathed in and out during a normal breath) and reducing respiratory rate. This leads to a more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs. Slow breathing can also improve lung function by increasing lung compliance (the ability of the lungs to expand) and reducing airway resistance.

### Nervous System Effects

Slow breathing has been shown to have a calming effect on the nervous system by reducing sympathetic nerve activity and increasing parasympathetic nerve activity. This leads to a reduction in [[Cortisol is the stress hormone]] such as [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] and an increase in feel-good hormones such as endorphins. Slow breathing can also improve cognitive function by increasing cerebral blood flow and oxygenation.

## Conclusion

Slow breathing has numerous psychophysiological benefits including improved cardiovascular function, respiratory function, and nervous system function. It is a simple yet effective technique that can be easily incorporated into daily life to promote health and wellbeing. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects and to determine optimal slow breathing parameters for specific populations.

This article reviews the research on the psychophysiological effects of slow breathing, which is taking less than 12 breaths per minute. Slow breathing has been used for centuries in traditional practices like yoga and meditation to promote physical and emotional wellbeing. The article covers the effects of slow breathing on various physiological systems such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and nervous systems.
