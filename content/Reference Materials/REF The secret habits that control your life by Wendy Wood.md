- Habits play a significant role in human behavior, often more than we realize, according to behavioral scientist Wendy Wood.
- Research has shown that people act on habits more than they are consciously aware of.
- Friction, such as barriers related to distance, time, and effort, can influence which behaviors become habits.
- Our habits are stored in a memory system that is resistant to change, and repetition of alternative behaviors is necessary to modify these habits.
- [[Our environment shapes our behaviour|Creating an environment that supports desired behaviors]] can make it easier to change habits and achieve goals.
