# Why Therapy is so Difficult

## My Thoughts and Reflections

People can give up therapy because they feel like the well of insight has dried up or that they are [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|talking about the same things over and over again]].

People will come up with excuses to give up therapy or even dislike the therapist in order to reduce their [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]] . All of these are forms of [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanisms]].

The best method of addressing and determining if the therapist is a good fit is by being straightforward with your thought process by [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|practicing emotional vulnerability]].

Remember that [[Success requires time and patience|success comes from not giving up]].

## Why Is Therapy So Hard? : OpenCounseling

The beginning of therapy usually feels pretty good. The [first few sessions](https://blog.opencounseling.com/what-to-expect-from-therapy/) might feel a little awkward, but then something clicks. You’re connecting to your therapist. You’re [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|opening up]] to them. You feel seen and known. Therapy starts to become your favorite part of the week.

You can’t wait to get to your session and start talking to your therapist. As good as it feels just to get it all out every week, and to be heard by someone who is fully present, the insights might just be the best part. You’re learning so much about yourself. You’re already making changes and life is already getting better.

Then something happens. You hit a wall. The well of insight seems to dry up. You feel like you’re talking about the same things over and over. You feel irritated after therapy instead of good. You even start to dislike your therapist a little. You start finding reasons to skip or cancel sessions.

## What Happened?

It might be a sign you need to take a break from therapy or that you need to work in a different way with your therapist. There may be an issue in [your relationship with your therapist](https://blog.opencounseling.com/relationship-with-your-therapist/) you need to address. But many times, it’s a natural part of the process that actually shows you’re making progress in therapy.

Read on to learn more about why therapy can get tough, how it can actually be a good sign when it does, how to keep going when you don’t want to go, and what makes it all worth it in the end.

## Why Is the Middle of Therapy Harder Than the Beginning?

The reason the middle of therapy can sometimes be difficult is the same reason it’s hard to be your own therapist.

Even if you’re totally dedicated in your quest for self-knowledge, your brain does its best to hide certain things from you. The process of finding your deepest self is more like navigating a labyrinth than looking in a mirror.

Therapists have many theories about how and why this happens. The gist of all of them is that there are things we don’t want to think about, feel, or remember, so our minds protect us from them.

Our brains are so efficient at taking care of this for us they do it completely outside of our awareness. We don’t even have a chance to say, “Wait, let me feel, think about, or remember that.” Most of the time, it doesn’t even come up for us to review.

## What Is Your Mind Protecting You From?

To the deep, protective part of the brain, unwanted memories, thoughts, and [[Staying with your emotional center of gravity|feelings]] are a threat. Why? Because:

- Revisiting [traumatic memories](https://blog.opencounseling.com/is-trauma-the-reason-i-feel-this-way/) can put you back in the same [[Sympathetic Nervous System|fight-or-flight]] mode as the event you’re remembering.
- You may have learned growing up that feeling or expressing certain feelings—or any feelings at all—is dangerous. The [stress response](https://blog.opencounseling.com/managing-stress/) can be triggered by any emotions you believe you’re not supposed to have.
- On a subconscious level, you sense that following certain thoughts to their natural conclusion could turn your entire life upside down.

So, your brain does its best to keep you from thinking, remembering, or feeling these things. Therapists call the techniques our brains use to do this our _defenses._

In some ways, this is good. If our minds didn’t protect us in this way, it would be hard to function.

We’d have to endure a near-constant state of stress. We wouldn’t have any room to be present in our daily lives. We’d have to spend most of our time and energy processing traumatic or painful memories and feelings. Everything that reminded us of the past would pull us right back into it emotionally and energetically. This would [wear down](https://blog.opencounseling.com/managing-stress/) our bodies as well as our minds.

The reason therapy can become difficult is that it puts you in a literal battle with yourself. Part of you pushes to learn the truth or change your behavior while another part tries to stop you. The fortress of your defenses can be hard to break through.

The good news is that this inner conflict isn’t impossible to overcome. In fact, [good therapists](https://blog.opencounseling.com/background-check-your-therapist/) know exactly what to do to help you get through your defenses so you can experience the healing that lies on the other side of them.

## What Are Defenses and How Do They Work?

Defenses are automatic, habitual reactions that keep [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|painful feelings]] or threatening truths outside of your conscious awareness. ^c35039

We all have a different set of characteristic defenses based on what we find the most threatening or difficult to face. What you defend against the hardest depends on what you've personally been through.

For example, if it’s threatening to your brain for you to express anger toward someone else, your defenses will do their best to keep that from happening. Instead, you may turn your anger inward, toward yourself, which can fuel [depression](https://blog.opencounseling.com/depression-vs-sadness/). Or you may interact with others in a way that encourages their anger while stifling your own. This allows you to confront anger without having to be the one to show it.

If anger isn’t threatening to your psyche, but other emotions—such as [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]] or sadness—are, you probably get angry often. You may even think of yourself as an angry person. Because your brain believes anger is the safest emotion for you to feel, it has become your default response to any emotional provocation.

If anger is the only emotion you feel safe expressing in front of others, it’s probably hard for you to be [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerable]], which makes it hard to maintain [intimate relationships](https://blog.opencounseling.com/do-we-need-couples-counseling/). It’s exhausting to be angry all of the time, so you might [use substances](https://blog.opencounseling.com/therapy-for-substance-abuse/), food, work, or screens to numb out and get a break from your anger.

### Defense Mechanisms You Might Use

There is no exhaustive master list of [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defense mechanisms]]. Your mind is creative and responsive to your life and environment, so the way it builds a wall around your most tender feelings and painful memories may be completely unique to you.

That said, therapists and psychologists have noticed certain defenses are more common than others, and that many people use them. These include:

While defenses serve an important purpose, they can end up doing more harm than good. Sometimes, defenses that were effective in the past stop being as effective. Or they start taking a toll on your adult life that they didn’t take on you when you were young.

Some of your defenses may have been harmful from the very beginning, but they allowed you to [[Survivor mentality|survive]] your childhood. Now you’re an adult who wants more from your life.

The ways you learned to survive and feel safe may now be holding you back from living a happy, fulfilled, authentic life. You may have developed a mental health condition or you may just feel like you’re not fully alive or fully yourself. When you get to this point, it’s a great time to reach out to a therapist to help you tear down the wall you’ve built.

## Why Do Defenses Make Therapy Difficult?

Defenses don’t give way easily. So, when the journey of therapy brings you to the wall they’ve built inside your mind, you may feel like you can’t go any further. How do you get to the other side? The first step is to recognize that you don’t want that wall there.

Your deepest, most entrenched defenses are probably the ones you’re least aware of—if you’re aware of them at all. In fact, your deepest defenses may feel like _you_. Until you recognize that your defenses aren’t you, any challenge to them can feel like a personal attack.

So, when your therapist challenges your defenses, even very gently, it can feel like they’re judging or rejecting you. You might feel like they’re trying to take away something important—something that keeps you safe, keeps your life from completely falling apart, or that keeps you _you_. So, you might start to push back against your therapist and resist going any further in your sessions.

### What Are Signs Your Defenses Are Up?

There’s a little gremlin in the control room of your brain that starts sending you warnings when you try to change—or even examine a little too closely—your approach to life.

It believes if you take down the old, strong walls of your defenses, you’ll be completely [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|vulnerable]]. It believes that keeping them up is the only way to make sure you continue to survive.

When this part of your brain gets inflamed and starts trying to protect you, it can change how your therapy sessions feel and how you respond to them.

When your defenses start coming up in therapy, you may:

- Come to therapy sessions late or miss them altogether.
- Try to change the subject or take your sessions in another direction.
- Stay on the surface of things and make more small talk with your therapist.
- Think about quitting therapy even though you haven’t achieved your [therapy goals](https://blog.opencounseling.com/setting-goals-for-therapy/).

These are all ways to avoid letting your defenses down. All of them can completely stall progress in therapy and make therapy feel like a waste of time.

Of course, there are other reasons you might “resist” what’s happening in therapy besides your internal resistance to dismantling your defenses. You might have a therapist who’s not attuned to you, who’s not [a good match](https://blog.opencounseling.com/how-to-choose-a-therapist/) for you, or who’s simply [not a good therapist](https://blog.opencounseling.com/therapists-to-avoid/). Your [intuition](https://blog.opencounseling.com/using-your-intuition-to-choose-the-right-therapist/) might be correctly telling you that something isn’t right and that you need to walk away from this therapist and find another one.

So, how do you tell whether your discomfort is a sign that something is going wrong in the therapy room or a sign that you’re about to have a breakthrough? And what can you do if your defenses are up—but you want to tear them down?

## What Can You Do to Get Back on Track in Therapy?

The answer to most problems in therapy is to talk to your therapist about them. If you’re worried about something that’s happening in therapy—or something that’s not happening—tell your therapist.

### Pro Tip

A good therapist won’t feel threatened or offended if you express concern about how therapy is going. They won’t get upset if you criticize them, and they won’t take it personally even if you get angry with them. Instead, they’ll tell you what they think is going on or agree to work with you to figure it out together.

If you’ve come up against your deepest defenses, your therapist will usually have ways to bring them out into the open and identify them. Once you both confirm that something deep inside you is trying to keep you from feeling, remembering, or sharing something, you can work together to confront it and access those hidden emotions and memories.

This doesn’t necessarily mean your therapist will confront you or that you’ll have to push really hard in therapy. In fact, this process can be quite gentle. It can be more like brushing away layers of dust than blowing a hole through the wall. It depends on your therapist’s approach and what you’re comfortable with.

### Does Method Matter?

Some [therapy methods](https://blog.opencounseling.com/what-therapy-method-is-right-for-me/), like eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP), push you into confronting traumatic memories or defenses earlier in the therapy process.

Other methods, like traditional long-term psychodynamic therapy and humanistic therapy, will take things more slowly and gently (but will still usually end up bringing you to the same place).

Which is better for you will depend on your specific needs, preferences, and personality.

What gets you through the hard part of therapy is the therapeutic alliance—how much you [[Trust is fluid|trust]] your therapist and feel safe [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|opening up]] to them. Having a [strong alliance](https://blog.opencounseling.com/relationship-with-your-therapist/) means you feel like you’re on the same team as your therapist. The stronger your alliance, the bigger the challenges you can overcome together in therapy.

One of the most important moments in therapy is when you recognize that the tension you’re feeling isn’t because your therapist is antagonizing you, but because you’re pushing up against your defenses. When you turn in the same direction as your therapist and face the fortress of your defenses together, you can combine your efforts and energy instead of pushing in opposite directions.

And once you and your therapist both start putting your energy into getting on the other side of your defenses—into figuring out how you really feel and who you really are—you can have some [incredible breakthroughs](https://blog.opencounseling.com/corrective-emotional-experience/) in therapy.

## What Happens After You Get Through the Hard Part of Therapy?

Breaking through the wall of your defenses can blow life wide open. It can make things possible for you that felt impossible before.

Working through blocks in therapy can give you more options. You can consciously choose for yourself where automatic, unconscious defensive processes chose for you before.

These expanded choices can change your life in small or big ways. You may decide to change jobs or careers or you may simply pick up some fun new hobbies.

Unearthing your true self in therapy can make life feel more vibrant. You might find yourself having more fun, taking more risks, and being less worried about how others judge you.

One of the things that making progress in therapy is most likely to change is your relationships. You may walk away from relationships you’ve realized are toxic or you may simply establish better boundaries with the difficult people in your life.

Either way, you’ll probably make new friends. Your new comfort with being who you really are will make you more radiant. Chances are good this will not only draw more people to you in general, but it will also attract people who are more like you—people to whom you can connect more deeply.

One thing progress in therapy doesn’t mean is that you’ll be defenseless. We will always have some defenses—which is good, because we need them. What therapy does is help us swap the defenses that limit us and close us down with defenses that are more adaptive and conscious. It helps us find ways to function well in the world that don’t come at the expense of joy and authenticity.

The greatest gift of therapy is that it helps us learn how to fully be ourselves and how to fully inhabit our lives.

## Conclusion

Therapy isn’t always hard, but sometimes, it can be. After you’ve been going for a while, your sessions may start to feel more challenging. The middle of therapy is usually harder than the beginning.

In the beginning, it usually feels really good to spend time with your therapist. It’s easy to go to a place where a warm, caring person who’s invested in you listens to you attentively and accepts you fully.

Therapy starts to become more difficult when you start to come up against some of your psychological defenses. These are the ways that your mind keeps feelings, memories, and thoughts that are painful or threatening out of your awareness.

Therapy invites you to let down your defenses and see who you really are underneath. The result of doing this is beautiful and affirming, but the [[Active practice leads to skill development|process of doing]] it can be painful and awkward.

Most defenses happen outside of your conscious awareness and may even feel like [[Identify with your goals|part of your identity]]. When you explore your defenses in therapy, it can feel like your therapist is criticizing or attacking you.

Trying to get through your defenses in therapy can complicate your relationship with your therapist and make sessions feel stressful. So, you may start looking for reasons to skip sessions or to quit therapy altogether. You may even start to dislike your therapist.

But if you stick with it, and get through the hard part of therapy, you’ll be rewarded—often with profound insights and [major breakthroughs](https://blog.opencounseling.com/corrective-emotional-experience/). We all need to have some defenses, but learning about ourselves in therapy allows us to leave behind the ones that limit and hurt us. Then, we can replace them with ways of coping and navigating life that are much more authentic.

The result is a new level of inner freedom. Working through your defenses in therapy can help you discover your true self. It can help you choose more consciously and experience more joy in life. So, if therapy is starting to feel a little uncomfortable, don’t give up. Sticking with it might just change your life.
