# REF Quantifying the Association Between Psychotherapy Content and Clinical Outcomes Using Deep Learning

## Key Points

> **Question**  What aspects of psychotherapy content are significantly associated with clinical outcomes?
>
> **Findings**  In this quality improvement study, a deep learning model was trained to automatically categorize therapist utterances from approximately 90 000 hours of internet-enabled [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)]]. Increased quantities of CBT change methods were positively associated with reliable improvement in patient symptoms, and the quantity of nontherapy-related content showed a negative association.
>
> **Meaning**  The findings support the key principles underlying CBT as a treatment and demonstrate that applying deep learning to large clinical data sets can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of psychotherapy.
>

These people used [[Machine Learning|deep learning]] to develop insights into how we can help improve clinicians in their use of [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|CBT]].

> The researchers showed that higher ratios of CBT talk correlate with better recovery rates, as measured by standard self-reported metrics used across the UK. They claim that their results provide validation for CBT as a treatment. CBT is widely considered effective already, but this study is one of the first large-scale experiments to back up that common assumption.
