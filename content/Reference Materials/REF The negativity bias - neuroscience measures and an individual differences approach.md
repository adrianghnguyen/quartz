## Thoughts and Reflections

- Evidence supports the existence of [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]]
- In theory, negativity bias is an evolutionary advantage as it allows us to avoid negative stimulus ([[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges]])
- Presents the concept of evaluative space model which serves to explain how we actually make our decisions within this mechanism
	- No clue what that evaluative space model is

## ABSTRACT

Past research has provided support for the existence of a [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]], the tendency for negativity to have a stronger impact than positivity. Theoretically, the negativity bias provides an evolutionary advantage, as it is more critical for survival to avoid a harmful stimulus than to pursue a potentially helpful one.

The current paper reviews the theoretical grounding of the negativity bias in the Evaluative Space Model, and presents recent findings using a multilevel approach that further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the negativity bias and underscore the importance of the negativity bias for human functioning.
