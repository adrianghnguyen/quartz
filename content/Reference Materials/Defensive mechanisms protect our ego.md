# Defensive mechanisms protect our ego

![[Why therapy is so difficult#^c35039]]

## Personal reflections on my ego and defense mechanisms

No one's perfect including me. The best thing we can do is to practice [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|self-regulation]] and [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|be kind to ourselves]] with [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|self-love]]. When interacting with others, remember the [[The zen of the accountabilabuddy|mantra of friendship]].

According to [[Why therapy is so difficult|Why Therapy is so Difficult]], there is no master list of defensive mechanisms as our minds can get quite creative in preventing us from engaging in [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]].

- See also [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances]] to understand the fundamental roots of these defensive mechanisms.
- See [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]] for why our ego comes in to defend us.

Defense mechanisms refer to psychological strategies or behaviors that people may use to cope with [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|difficult feelings]], thoughts, or events.

## How Do Defensive Mechanisms Work

Defense mechanisms are ways you react to situations that bring up negative emotions. According to [psychoanalytic theory](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559106/), when you experience a stressor, the subconscious will first monitor the situation to see if it might harm you. If the [subconscious](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/let-your-brain-process-decisions-subconsciously) believes the situation might lead to emotional harm, it may react with a defense mechanism to protect you.

## Top 10 Most Common Defense Mechanisms

Dozens of different defense mechanisms have been identified. Some are used more commonly than others. Here are a few common defense mechanisms:

### 1. Denial

[Denial](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/how-to-practice-healthy-coping-strategies) is one of the most common defense mechanisms. It occurs when you refuse to accept reality or facts. People in denial may block external events or circumstances from the mind so that they don’t have to deal with the emotional impact. In other words, they avoid painful feelings or events. This defense mechanism is one of the most widely known, too. The phrase, “They’re in denial,” is commonly understood to mean a person is avoiding reality despite what may be obvious to people around them.

### 2. Repression

Unsavory thoughts, painful memories, or irrational beliefs can upset you. Instead of facing those thoughts, *people may unconsciously choose to hide them in hopes of forgetting them entirely.* That does not mean, however, that the [memories](https://www.healthline.com/health/false-memory) disappear entirely. They may influence behaviors, and they may impact future relationships. You just may not realize the impact this defense mechanism is having.

### 3. Projection

Some thoughts or feelings you have about another person may make you uncomfortable. When people [project those feelings](https://www.healthline.com/health/projection-psychology), they *misattribute them to the other person.* This is an example of the fundamental attribution error - FAE - which is a type of cognitive bias ([[Brains are biased by nature]]).

For example, you may dislike your new co-worker, but instead of accepting that, you choose to tell yourself that they dislike you. You start to interpret their words and actions toward you in the worst way possible, even though they don’t actually dislike you.

### 4. Displacement

You direct strong [emotions](https://www.healthline.com/health/mens-health/accept-emotions-as-they-are) and frustrations toward a person or object that doesn’t feel threatening. In other words, you *choose an alternative target for your [[Use powerful emotions towards constructive ends|strong emotions]]* instead of the original source. This allows you to satisfy an impulse to react, but you don’t risk significant consequences.

A good example of this defense mechanism is [getting angry at your child](https://www.healthline.com/health/causes-of-child-abuse) or spouse because you had a bad day at work. Neither of these people is the target of your strong emotions, but your subconscious may believe reacting to them is likely less problematic than reacting to your boss.

### 5. Regression

Some people who feel threatened or anxious may unconsciously *“escape” to an earlier stage of development*. This type of defense mechanism may be most obvious in young children. If they experience trauma or loss, they may suddenly act as if they’re younger again. They may even begin wetting the bed or sucking their thumb as a form of [regression](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/age-regression).

Adults can regress, too. Adults who are struggling to cope with events or behaviors may *return to sleeping with a cherished stuffed animal, **overeat foods they find comforting**, or begin chain-smoking or chewing on pencils or pens.* They may also avoid everyday activities because they feel overwhelmed.

### 6. Rationalization

Some people may *attempt to explain undesirable behaviors with their own set of “facts.”* This allows you to feel comfortable with the choice you made, even if you know on another level it’s not right.

For example, someone who didn’t get a promotion at work might say they didn’t want the promotion anyways. It is another way of rewriting our interpretation of reality to reduce cognitive dissonance.

### 7. Sublimation

This type of defense mechanism is considered a mature, [positive strategy](https://www.healthline.com/health/anger-management-exercises). That’s because people who rely on it *choose to redirect strong emotions or feelings into an object or activity that is appropriate and safe*.

For example, instead of lashing out at your coworkers during a stressful shift, you choose to channel your frustration into a kickboxing class. You could also funnel or redirect the feelings into music, art, or sports.

### 8. Reaction Formation

People who use this defense mechanism *recognize how they feel, but they choose to behave in the opposite manner of their instincts*.

A person who reacts this way, for example, may feel they should not express negative emotions, such as anger or frustration. They choose to instead *react in an overly positive way*.

### 9. Compartmentalization

*Separating your life into independent sectors* may feel like a way to protect many elements of it. For example, when you choose to not discuss personal life issues at [work](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/work-life-balance), you block off, or compartmentalize, that element of your life. This allows you to carry on without facing the anxieties or challenges while you’re in that setting or mindset.

### 10. Intellectualization

When you’re hit with a trying situation, you may choose to *remove all emotion* from your responses and *instead focus on quantitative facts*.

You may see this strategy in use when a person spends their days creating spreadsheets of job opportunities and leads after they are let go from a job.``
