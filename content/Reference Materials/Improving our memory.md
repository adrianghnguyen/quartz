# Improve memory by using strategies to increase information retention

We can learn to develop strategies which will help us increase our ability to recall information.

It is easy to become distracted in our modern society as there are multiple things [[Become focused by managing attention|competing for our attention]] such as [[Social media epidemic contributes to the mental health crisis|social media]] and [[Digital Minimalism|digital devices]]. It's easy to forget things. Many things can cause [[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind|attention residue]].

That's why I use specific memory techniques to help give me [[Our environment shapes our behaviour|environmental cues]] on [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|remembering]] things to [[Organizing my life|organize my life]] and help remind me [[Become focused by managing attention|stay focused]] on [[Purpose in life|what's important]]. Most of the time, I follow the [[Getting things done philosophy]] methodology.

## General Strategies

> - Take care of your [[Mind-body connection|body]]. If you take care of your body by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep, you improve your [brain health](https://www.verywellmind.com/strategies-to-boost-cognitive-health-and-fight-brain-aging-4077306) which helps you process and recall memories better.
> - Exercise your mind. There are several [activities](https://www.verywellmind.com/top-websites-and-games-for-brain-exercise-2224140) and [puzzles](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-puzzles-5092777) you could do to give your mind a great workout.
> - Stay mentally active. Reading, [[Writing is the medium by which we think|writing]], and constantly learning help you remain mentally active, which can improve your memory.[https://www.verywellmind.com/different-types-of-memory-and-their-functions-5194859#:~:text=The%20four%20general%20types%20of,)%20or%20explicit%20(conscious).]

## Strategies for learning under high cognitive loads or high stress

When we are [[Complete the Stress Response Cycle with intent|under stress]], we have a limited capacity to learn as we don't have as many [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|available cognitive resources]] within our [[Working memory is limited|working memory]].

### Reduce the load on working memory to be assimilated at one time

In accordance with the *narrow limits of change principle* - working memory is limited in capacity and is depleted over time. The general theory is that we can only hold in our minds about [[Working memory is limited|seven chunks of information]].

### Use schemas and borrowed long term memory from other sources to organize information

According to the *borrowing and reorganizing principle*, humans typically borrow their information from schemas in [[long-term memory]]. Examples include long-term memories of other people through imitation, listening to what they say, or reading what they have written.

This information is borrowed and reorganized to make meaningful representations. [[Brains organize information into schemas|Schema theory]] assumes that knowledge is organized into units, [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemata]], and stored in long term memory. [[Brains organize information into schemas|Schemata]] represent knowledge about concepts, objects, and the relationships amongst them. In essence, the mental structure of preconceived ideas.

## Strategies to stop forgetting information

When we are [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning|trying to learn rapidly]], It is easy for us to forget things quickly, decently, kind of like a leaky bucket. As a result, we want to start using techniques and to really cement our knowledge and understanding of things into [[Long-term Memory|long-term memory]]..

> To excel in any area, you need to remember stuff. Yet, our brain forgets things quickly and consistently, like a leaky bucket. Understand why you forget things, so you can deliberately use counter-strategies to remember things for the short-term and long-term.

> 1. Active learning: Engage with the information by taking notes, asking questions, and participating in discussions. This helps reinforce the information in your memory.
> 2. [[Spaced repetition is superior to rote memorization|Spaced repetition]]:  This helps strengthen your memory and prevents forgetting.
> 3. Mnemonic devices: Use techniques like acronyms, rhymes, or visualization to create mental associations that make it easier to remember information.
> 4. Chunking: Break down complex information into smaller, more manageable chunks. This makes it easier to remember and recall.
> 5. Teach someone else: Explain the information to someone else in your own words. Teaching requires a deep understanding of the material and helps solidify it in your memory.
> 6. Use multiple senses: Engage multiple senses while learning, such as listening to audio recordings, watching videos, or using tactile materials. This can enhance memory retention.
> 7. Stay organized: Keep your study materials organized and create a structured study plan. This helps you maintain focus and prevents information from getting lost or forgotten.
> 8. Practice retrieval: Test yourself on the information by practicing recall regularly. This strengthens memory retrieval and helps identify areas that need more review.
> 9. Get enough sleep: Sleep is crucial for consolidating memories. Make sure to get enough quality sleep to support effective memory retention.
> 10. Stay motivated and interested: Find personal relevance in the information you're learning and stay motivated by setting goals and rewarding yourself for progress. When you are genuinely interested in a topic, you are more likely to remember it.


## Can You Improve Your Memory?

It’s commonplace to hear people complain about having [poor memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-causes-memory-loss-4123636). When we try to recall information we have encoded and stored, and we can’t, then our memory has failed us. The good news is that it is possible to improve your memory and make the process of encoding, storing, and recalling information more seamless. Here are a couple of [tips that could help you improve your memory](https://www.verywellmind.com/great-ways-to-improve-your-memory-2795356): 

-   **Take care of your body**. If you take care of your body by eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough [[Maintain sleep hygiene|sleep]], you improve your [brain health](https://www.verywellmind.com/strategies-to-boost-cognitive-health-and-fight-brain-aging-4077306) which helps you process and recall memories better. 
-   **Exercise your mind**. There are several [activities](https://www.verywellmind.com/top-websites-and-games-for-brain-exercise-2224140) and [puzzles](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-puzzles-5092777) you could do to give your mind a great workout. 
-   **Take advantage of calendars and planners**. Clear up memory space in your brain by using calendars and [planners](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-bullet-journals-5119098) to remember the little things like shopping lists and meeting times. 
-   **Stay mentally active**. Reading, writing, and constantly learning help you remain mentally active, which can improve your memory.
