# Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells

## Personal notes

- [[Raffles Zhang]] shared this paper with me - I am interested in reading it to better understand the nature of his work on visual perception from a psychophysical (intermix of physics and psychology) perspective.
- Barlow proposed the following theory of natural vision: "The goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy"^[Field, D. J. (1987). Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells. Josa a, 4(12), 2379-2394.]
- Edge detection is one of the ways that our eyes currently analyzes vision which involves [[Fourier transform|Fourier analysis]] but it does not serve as a general theory
- "Evidence that cortical neurons can generally be classified as edge detectors is lacking"^[Field, D. J. (1987). Relations between the statistics of natural images and the response properties of cortical cells. Josa a, 4(12), 2379-2394.]
- Gibson proposes that we need to consider natural [[How environmental factors affect brain development|environment]] in understanding how the brain performs visual processing
- The purpose of this paper is to help explain how the natural environment does not consist of random patterns but rather have consistent statistical properties. Understanding these statistics can help us understand the nature of the mammalian visual system and its encoding system of visual stimuli.

## Proposed model of vision

>
> -   (2) In the frequency domain, the distance between neighboring orientation channels is determined by the orientation bandwidth, which also determines the length of the individual sensors and hence the spacing along the length of the sensors.

>
> -   (5) The total number of sensors is independent of the particular choice of spatial-frequency or orientation bandwidth (i.e., an image consisting of 65,536 pixels is represented by 65,536 sensors).

> As Laughlin[[16]](https://opg.optica.org/josaa/fulltext.cfm?uri=josaa-4-12-2379&id=2980#ref16) pointed out, an efficient sensory system should match its analyzers to the nature of the signals it processes. If images of the natural environment were truly random, then a statistical match would not be possible. However, natural images are not random, and the redundant properties can be exploited to provide an efficient code.

## Abstract

%%make it easy to delete under a heading%%
The relative efficiency of any particular image-coding scheme should be defined only in relation to the class of images that the code is likely to encounter. To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow’s theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy.
