# Chinese Strategy and Military Forces in 2021

## Personal Notes

- China wishes to blend the military industrial complex along with civilian technology and infrastructure
- All levels of society will be integrated into the statecraft's purpose of restoring China to their 'former glory and power'
	- Vertical and horizontal integration of society towards this purpose
	- It means talent development, technology development and economic levers in order to craft their grand geopolitical strategy
- AI will play a future role in their C2 (Command and Control) system
	- Intelligentized warfare as opposed to today's informational warfare
		- Predict and assimilate big data
	- Supposedly currently using advanced [[Machine Learning|machine learning]]  models to do geopolitical decisions
	- Corporate AI champions such as Huawei, Tencent, AliBaba
	- "Next Generation AI Plan" -> [Full Translation: China’s ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan’ (2017)](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/)
- China is hoping to modernize their army and leapfrog the US by 2050 to world-class standard
	- Big investments in military development, R&D, organizational reforms
	- Investing one of the highest percentages of GDP into military R&D and defense expenditure
	- "Although the total dollar value of China’s defense budget remains significantly below that of the United States, China has benefited from “late-comer advantage.” In other words, China has not had to invest in costly R&D of new technologies to the same degree as the United States. Rather, China has routinely adopted the best and most effective platforms found in foreign militaries through direct purchase, retrofits, or theft of intellectual property. By doing so, China has been able to focus on expediting its military modernization at a small fraction of the original cost."^[p.7]
- Military force standings
	- In 2020, China seems to possess as much manpower and more equipment as the US
		- Largest standing ground force nearing 1m personnel in combat units
		- Largest navy in the world numerically
			- Contains a mix of modern multi-role platforms including submarines and continuing to build aircraft carriers which would allow for force projection
			- includes a few nuclear capable submarines
		- Catching up to Western air forces with modern air platforms including UAVs
	- Within the local region, projected for 2025 within this report, China will have much more assets in the Indo-Pacific theatre
- Interesting side note on Russia-Ukraine war
	- ![[Pasted image 20230325225649.png|600]]
	- Based on Perun's video, China was able to use this as an economic lever to source cheap oil since current Russia has economic sanctions imposed limiting their market opportunities
- China and Taiwan
	- 2020 report states that China seems willing to defer active military force as long as long term unification discussions can be hard over the long term and the costs of conflict outweigh the benefits
	- Taiwan issue is the primary wedge between US-China politics
	- General PLA posturing seems to indicate getting ready for amphibious invasion capability
	- Taiwan will need to use asymmetric warfare in response to the modernization and the advanced capabilities of the reforming PLA army
		- Level of Taiwan's deterrence capabilities seems to be eroding with time as Chinese investments ramp up in scale
	- US deterrence credibility ranges from mixed to weak on factors like clarity of message, local force capability, etc. ^[p.133]
- Nuclear usage
	- China maintains a "No First Use (NFU)" policy but it remains unclear when it would act outside of this parameter
	- China investing in developing nuclear triad capabilities (air, ground, sea) launch
	- Currently increasing nuclear stockpiles
	- Global strike capabilities
- China as an actor in the domain of space
	- Upgrading launch capabilities and increasing deployments of satellites through increased number of launches

## Questions

1. to what extent if any does corruption and authoritarianism affect reports on Chinese military capabilities? Russia was a paper tiger - but the situations cannot be compared directly.
2. How well do 5th generation Chinese fighters perform? NGAD aims to begin rolling out in 2030 with full production in 2030s

	- interesting article because it talks about the current geopolitical landscape in 2011
	- general takeaway is that deterrence is the best option for the US Military and using economic sanctions and tools
	- if it does go to the right combat it will most likely be missile launches as well as asymmetric cyber warfare

This report serves to focus on the military development not only in forces but of military geopolitical strategy.
