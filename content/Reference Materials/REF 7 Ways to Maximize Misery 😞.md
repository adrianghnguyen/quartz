> Many people strive for happiness, but this text takes an unconventional approach, presenting seven tactics of how to succumb to external forces and internal impulses that can lead to unhappiness or 'sadness'. The premise is, by understanding these antithetical aspects, one can also understand what it takes to truly achieve happiness.

> Key advice to achieve unhappiness are:
>
> 1. **Stay still and inactive** - Avoid physical movement as it promotes reward chemicals in your brain that could derail gloominess.
> 2. **Confine yourself to one room** - Your bedroom becomes your all-room where you live, work, play and sleep, thus limiting your physical and psychological space.
> 3. **Disrupt your sleep pattern** - Vary your bedtime and wake time frequently, causing disturbed and irregular sleep which can worsen your mood.
> 4. **Increase screen time** - Use screens to keep you inactive, disrupt your sleep schedule, and distract you from natural physical impulses.
> 5. **Stoke negative emotions** - Use your screen to fuel anger, anxiety, resentment or despair about things over which you have no control or influence.
> 6. **Set [[Create effective goals|vague, unattainable goals]]** - Engage the productive part of your brain in aspirational actions that will likely lead to inaction and disappointment.
> 7. **Pursue happiness directly** - Aim for an unrealistic, ever-blissful state of being rather than improving the circumstances of your life.

> Much of the advice presented here comes from "How to Be Miserable by Randy J. Paterson PhD"
