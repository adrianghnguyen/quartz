2. Make your plan measurable.
3. Chase it endlessly.
4. Don't let other similar thoughts distract you from it.

| 1    | Determine your shortlist       | Know what you want and cut out everything else which his not relevant                                                                                      | You can begin by making a list of your top 25 goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                                                                             |
| 2    | Curate your top 5              | We only have limited resources - time, [[Working memory is limited\|attention]], money, etc. We have to be judicious in how it is spent.                  | Ask yourself "Are these my highest priority?" And keep going in a [[Feedback loop\|feedback loop]] unless you've cut it out to the bare minimum. Shortlist the shortlist. Then do it again. And again. |                                                                                             |
| 3    | Make a plan for the top 5      | Create a timeline and your approach.                                                                                                                       | Determine your strategy ([[Think strategically]])                                                                                                                                                                                                        | What are measurable steps towards the dream? Who can help me? When should they be achieved? |
| 4    | Laser focus on the essential - | All the other goals not in the top 5 are now secondary. Become fully invested in your top 5.                                                               | Avoid working on the other goals as they will divert essential resources. [[Become focused by managing attention]].                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                             |
| 5    | Avoid all secondary objectives | These are the things which will derail you. Everyone has competing attentions  so if you follow what everyone else does, no wonder you won't find success. | Practice intentionality through [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment\|mindfulness]] and [[Remove distractions through minimalism|minimalism]]. Remember that everything secondary is not important at the moment.                                             |                                                                                             |

### Making Dreams a Reality

1.  Knowing [[Purpose in life|what you want in life]] and set priorities to achieve your [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|ideal life]]
2.  Learning the tools to get you there.
3.  Having the [insane focus](https://liveyourlegend.net/11-steps-to-insane-focus-get-more-of-what-matters-done-in-3-hours-than-most-do-in-a-week) to combine the two.
4. Learn to say no.

## Thoughts

I sometimes reflect on what kind of people I wish to keep within [[Choose social circles wisely|my social circle]].

### Making SMART Goals

I find it interesting because according to the SMART goal planning method - we need something that is measurable. They could've left it ambiguous, something like "Only select a few" but by saying 5 - they've provided a constraint.

Constraints are discussed within the [[The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman]] as how reducing the possibility space creates focus which leads to better decision-making for end users. Seems similar applied here.

### Decision-making and the existential concept of time

Humans have an interesting relationship with the concept of time. It permeates our decision-making models. By setting time boundaries to a task, we learn to make them more salient, more real. It's something I learned from [[Algorithms to Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths]] in how time is a hard factor to calculate in our decision-making.
