## State of the micromobility industry

This was a very insightful video about the current state of the problem. My friend %% [[Rachel Cao|Rachel Cao]] %%  works in this industry So she's been sharing some of her thoughts and they've been going through a lot of changes. Long story short, there's a lot of challenges in how businesses want to approach an industry which needs to manage its operational expenditures and it's important for governments and private industry to align interests.

## Lessons on decision-making

### Get the big decisions right

> [!NOTE] Notes from [How to Build a Profitable Company in Shared Micromobility w/ Lime President Joe Kraus - YouTube @836s](https://youtu.be/7qgVROw36GE?t=836)

> The president of Lime was asked about reflections on the big mistakes he may have done and it's interesting to see that even someone successful and has a lot of experience, his initial reaction was to accept with humility that, yeah, you will make mistakes - it is inevitable.

Highlights:
- Big decisions are few and far between.
- It's important to get the big decisions right most of the others ones are insignificant.
- Big decisions can often only be identified through the power of hindsight and retrospection. It's often difficult to tell in the moment.
- Making hard choices are hardest when options exist. Most of us only make hard decisions when we lack options.

His advice is that when we look at the past, only then can we tell what were the big decisions. They are few and far between, but those are the ones which we need to get right. The question then becomes, when looking forward into the future, it can be impossible to tell which of the small decisions will become big ones.

It's often only through retrospection and looking at the past that one can tell what were big decisions. Perhaps it's important not to [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|dwell on the past]] on what we got wrong then.

- [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|Make choices which minimize future regret.]]

### Align personal actions to authentic values

> The President of Lime talks about his regret minimization weekend, and he was projecting out how he would feel about himself when he was 80 years old, considering that he's 46 at the moment.
> 
> At the time, he was an active investor in multiple domains yet when he was talking to his friends and other loved ones how he thought about the most pressing issue was carbon reduction - 
> 
> To everyone, he spoke about the importance of carbon footprint reduction yet in his "energy, effort, vigor and drive" he was doing little to solve the problem. He found that his actions were misaligned with his values. 

I think my personal lesson to take away is that if [[Identify with your goals|I truly believe]] something is important, I should align my actions towards these ends - this means redirecting my [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|personal energy]] towards an authentic [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]].
