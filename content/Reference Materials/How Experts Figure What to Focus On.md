> 1. Try different things until something comes easily to you. By experimenting with various ideas or tasks, you can identify what comes naturally and works well for you.
> 2. Pay attention and measure your progress. Whether it's tracking marketing efforts, workout sessions, or practice sessions, measuring your performance can help you determine what is working and what needs improvement.
> 3. Make a decision about what to focus on. At some point, you need to decide whether to continue trying new things or commit to one strategy. It's important to weigh the pros and cons and make a choice based on the information you have.
> 4. Put in a consistent volume of work. Embrace boredom and stay committed to putting in the necessary repetitions to truly understand the fundamentals of your task or goal.
> 5. Simplify and focus on what is essential. Once you have experimented, made a decision, and put in the work, you can start trimming away unnecessary elements and focus on what truly matters for success.
> 6. Mastering the fundamentals takes time and effort. It's a challenging journey, but it is crucial for achieving success in any area of life.
