# Id Ego and Superego by Freud

## My Thoughts and Reflections

### Relevance of Freud's concepts of id ego and superego

> [!error] Modern psychology has deprecated this model of how our minds operate

There are criticisms of these concepts presented by Sigmund Freud. I think they're useful as a [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]] to explain the various parts of our brain and its behaviors. The psychoanalysis part of his theory does not really hold much scrutiny under today's scientific approach centering on biological, social and psychological factors.

> [!NOTE] On the subject of the modern relevance of id, ego, superego
> Today's functional theories and practices are mostly based on cognitive, behaviorist, and neuropsychological bases in a model that factors in biological, social and psychological factors when considering individuals. Under these systems the brain is more or less considered to be a single entity and not subdivided into metaphysical roles based on morality and perception.

Elaborate the link to how environmental factors affect brain development and thus our behavior.

## Critical conscience exists as a gap between ego and superego

The part of a person's mind that acts as a self-critical conscience, reflecting social standards learned from parents and teachers. There are  [[Dealing with our inner critic|Strategies for dealing with our inner critic]]. Often times when our ego or our [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] is under attack, it may engage [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanisms]]. Our ego is the need to prove ourselves.

> The ego has the ability to create false thoughts, which is the [[Inner monologue is the process of silently speaking meaningful thoughts|inner chater]] we hear most often. In fact, it is the voice in our heads that we sometimes tell to “shut up.” Otherwise, we can become overwhelmed by these thoughts or even lose touch with reality. This is one reason why during meditation it’s a good idea to let thoughts come and go, rather than becoming obsessed with them or focusing on anyone in particular.^[https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-empowerment-diary/201709/calming-the-monkey-mind]

## The Id

- According to Freud, the id is the source of all psychic energy, making it the primary component of personality.1
- [The id](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-id-2795275) is the only component of personality that is present from birth.
- This aspect of personality is entirely unconscious and includes instinctive and primitive behaviors.

## The Ego

- According to Freud, [the ego](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-ego-2795167) develops from the id and ensures that the impulses of the id can be expressed in a manner acceptable in the real world.[2](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00008)
- The ego functions in the [conscious](https://www.verywellmind.com/conscience-vs-conscious-whats-the-difference-2794961), preconscious, and [unconscious](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-unconscious-2796004) mind.
- The ego is the personality component responsible for dealing with reality.3

## The Superego aka our idealized self

The last component of personality to develop is [the superego](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-superego-2795876).

- According to Freud, the superego begins to emerge at around age five.
- The superego holds the internalized moral standards and ideals that we acquire from our parents and society (our sense of right and wrong).^[Boag S. Ego, drives, and the dynamics of internal objects. Front Psychol. 2014;5:666. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00666]
- The superego provides guidelines for making judgments.

The superego has two parts:

1. The **conscience** includes information about things that are viewed as bad by parents and society. These behaviors are often forbidden and lead to bad consequences, punishments, or feelings of guilt and remorse.^[Schalkwijk F. A New Conceptualization of the Conscience. Front Psychol. 2018;9:1863. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01863]
2. The **ego ideal** includes the rules and standards for behaviors that the ego aspires to.^[Schalkwijk F. A New Conceptualization of the Conscience. Front Psychol. 2018;9:1863. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01863]
