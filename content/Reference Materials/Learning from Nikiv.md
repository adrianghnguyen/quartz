## Bite-sized Insights Learned from Nikiv

### Opinion on AI

> I liked Joscha Bach's presentation on evolution of AI and how it relates to **understanding of consciousness**.

### Themes, Goals and Actions

[Goals | Everything I know](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/focusing/goals) <- he has themes, goals, actions

### Appreciating the Complex Nature of Life

> From the psychedelic experiences I had in my life, I learned to **appreciate the complex nature that is the human brain.** Its ability to *detect patterns in everything and draw connections is truly marvelous.*

Made him into his own section. Has one of the most extensive knowledge platforms. That way I can also use this to reference in my other notes.
