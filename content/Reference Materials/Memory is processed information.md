# Humans process information through memories

> [!tip] Check out the main hub  [[_MOC Memory|main hub on memories]]

Memory refers to the brain's ability to store and retain information for later recall through experiences. It serves a vital role in cognitive function that enables individuals to learn, adapt, and make decisions based on past experiences.

Memory is important because it enables us to interact with the world around us effectively. It helps us learn from past experiences and [[make informed decisions]] based on them. Therefore, a healthy memory is critical for personal growth and development.

At the same time, we should understand that [[Use the Day Reconstruction Method to track happiness|memories are reconstructive in nature]] and our experiences within the world are subject to [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive bias]].  [[Non-zero day mindset|Engaging in a positive mindset]] is beneficial.

## Memory has a vital role in our daily lives

Memory plays a vital role in our daily lives such as remembering important events, people, places, and things. It helps us navigate through our environment by recalling various skills and knowledge necessary for survival. Memory also helps us build relationships by recognizing people we have met before and recalling past conversations with them.

Moreover, memory is essential for learning new skills, acquiring knowledge, and forming new memories. Without memory, it would be difficult to retain information or learn new things.

# Memories mediate the connection between our body and mind

Our brain is a recipient and final interpreter of information, which is a [[Personality is shaped our environment|type of stimuli gathered from the environment]]. This serves to explain how humans interpret and process information. However, memories are the [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|final output of this process]]. As a result, we cannot forget about the mind portion of the [[Mind-body connection|mind-body connection]].
