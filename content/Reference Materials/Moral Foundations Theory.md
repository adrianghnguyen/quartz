# Moral Foundations Theory

## Critiques and alternative theories of morality

- See also [[Critique on Moral Foundations Theory]]
- [[Evolutionary Moral Psychology Theory]] which says that morality is there to gel social behaviors and society

## Social Intuitionist Theory was a predecessor of Moral Foundations Theory

### What is Social Intuitionist Theory?

This is a the **preceding** theory by Jonathan Haidt who also came up with **moral foundations theory (a refinement)**. Social intuitionist theory suggests that moral judgments are based primarily on intuitive [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|emotional responses]], rather than [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|conscious reasoning]]. According to this perspective, moral judgments are shaped by social and cultural influences, and are often made quickly and without conscious deliberation such as in [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|implicit reasoning]] which may be driven by [[Brains are biased by nature|bias]].

This was the beginning of what would later become [[Moral Foundations Theory]].

### Social Intuitionist Theory Challenged the Traditional Views of Morality as a Purely Rational Process

> The social intuitionist theory was first proposed by Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist and professor of ethical leadership at New York University's Stern School of Business. Haidt's work on the social intuitionist theory has been influential in the fields of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience, and has helped to **challenge traditional views of moral psychology as a purely rational process**. His research has explored the role of emotions and intuitions in shaping moral judgments, and has emphasized the importance of cultural and social factors in shaping our moral beliefs and values.

Moral Foundations Theory was created by a group of social and cultural psychologists (see us here) to understand why morality varies so much across cultures yet still shows so many similarities and recurrent themes. In brief, the theory proposes that several innate and universally available psychological systems are the foundations of “intuitive ethics.” Each culture then constructs virtues, narratives, and institutions on top of these foundations, thereby creating the unique moralities we see around the world, and conflicting within nations too. The five foundations for which we think the evidence is best are:

1) Care/harm: This foundation is related to our long evolution as mammals with attachment systems and an ability to feel (and dislike) the pain of others. It underlies virtues of kindness, gentleness, and nurturance.

2) Fairness/cheating: This foundation is related to the evolutionary process of reciprocal altruism. It generates ideas of justice, rights, and autonomy. [Note: In our original conception, Fairness included concerns about equality, which are more strongly endorsed by political liberals. However, as we reformulated the theory in 2011 based on new data, we emphasize proportionality, which is endorsed by everyone, but is more strongly endorsed by conservatives]

3) Loyalty/betrayal: This foundation is related to our long history as tribal creatures able to form shifting coalitions. It underlies virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice for the group. It is active anytime people feel that it’s “one for all, and all for one.”

4) Authority/subversion: This foundation was shaped by our long primate history of hierarchical social interactions. It underlies virtues of leadership and followership, including deference to legitimate authority and respect for traditions.

5) Sanctity/degradation: This foundation was shaped by the psychology of disgust and contamination. It underlies religious notions of striving to live in an elevated, less carnal, more noble way. It underlies the widespread idea that the body is a temple which can be desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants (an idea not unique to religious traditions).

We think there are several other very good candidates for “foundationhood,” especially:

6) Liberty/oppression: This foundation is about the feelings of reactance and resentment people feel toward those who dominate them and restrict their liberty. Its intuitions are often in tension with those of the authority foundation. The hatred of bullies and dominators motivates people to come together, in solidarity, to oppose or take down the oppressor. We report some preliminary work on this potential foundation in this paper, on the psychology of libertarianism and liberty.

Much of our present research involves applying the theory to political “cultures” such as those of liberals and conservatives. The current American culture war, we have found, can be seen as arising from the fact that liberals try to create a morality relying primarily on the Care/harm foundation, with additional support from the Fairness/cheating and Liberty/oppression foundations. Conservatives, especially religious conservatives, use all six foundations, including Loyalty/betrayal, Authority/subversion, and Sanctity/degradation. The culture war in the 1990s and early 2000s centered on the legitimacy of these latter three foundations. In 2009, with the rise of the Tea Party, the culture war shifted away from social issues such as abortion and homosexuality, and became more about differing conceptions of fairness (equality vs. proportionality) and liberty (is government the oppressor or defender?). The Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street are both populist movements that talk a great deal about fairness and liberty, but in very different ways, as you can see here, for the Tea Party, and here, for OWS.

The theory was first developed from a simultaneous review of current evolutionary thinking about morality and cross-cultural research on virtues (reported in Haidt & Joseph, 2004 [request paper]). The theory is an extension of Richard Shweder’s theory of the “three ethics” commonly used around the world when people talk about morality. (See this article: Shweder, R. A., Much, N. C., Mahapatra, M., & Park, L. [1997]. The “big three” of morality [autonomy, community, and divinity] and the “big three” explanations of suffering). The theory was also strongly influenced by Alan Fiske‘s relational models theory.
