# Techniques to Find My Classification and how to classify things

## Use the Wikipedia Dewey Decimal System

> [!NOTE] How to use the dewey decimal system to organize my tags
> They should fall under the big umbrellas or be regrouped according to this. Ctrl+F a topic to find it.
>
> I've made a shortlist of the topics. To see the complete list, go see on Wikipedia [List of Dewey Decimal classes - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes)

## Use a Dewey search Engine

I made search shortcut within Chrome to find books/topics within the Dewey Decimal system. By finding a book on the topic of my tag, I can get an approximate idea of what classification it should go in.

Here I searched for Waffles and I can get an idea of what genre it should be in. So if I had something about waffles, that's how I'd tag it using "#food/cooking" for example.

# [List of Dewey Decimal classes - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes)

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The [Dewey Decimal Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification "Dewey Decimal Classification") (DDC) is structured around ten main classes covering the entire world of [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge"); each main class is further structured into ten [hierarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy "Hierarchy") divisions, each having ten divisions of increasing specificity.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#cite_note-1) As a system of [library classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_classification "Library classification") the DDC is "arranged by discipline, not subject", so a topic like [clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing "Clothing") is classed based on its disciplinary treatment (psychological influence of clothing at 155.95, customs associated with clothing at 391, and fashion design of clothing at 746.92) within the conceptual framework.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#cite_note-2) The list below presents the ten main classes, hundred divisions, and thousand sections.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes#cite_note-3)
