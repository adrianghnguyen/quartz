3. Adaptive responses to [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stress]], such as [[disassociation is tuning out as an adaptive response|dissociation or tuning out]], may initially help a child cope, but they can become long-term traits that contribute to dysfunction and pathology.
4. The absence of [[Emotional availability|emotionally available]], consistent, non-stressed, and mutually responsive parents can interfere with optimal brain development and lead to conditions like [[ADHD|ADHD]].
5. Childhood development disorders and behavioral issues can often be traced back to the impact of [[Generational trauma|multi-generational trauma]] and [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|stress]] on brain development, rather than being purely genetic.
