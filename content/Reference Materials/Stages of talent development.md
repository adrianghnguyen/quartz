## Gifted children tend to realize their talent in adulthood

Most gifted children will not realize the [[Self-actualization is becoming your best self|full potential]] of their talent until the culmination phase which tends to occurs in adulthood. It requires a lot of work to get to this point of the talent process with [[Talent is dedication by few|only few ever achieving it]].

This page serves to explain how a [[High intellectual potential overview|gifted child may learn to nurture their potential into talent]]. We can better understand this [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|process]] through the [[Ingredients for HPI Development|necessary factors]] to make this happen.

Do note that it is a [[Societal view on giftedness|myth about high intellectual potential]] all [[High intellectual potential overview|gifted children]] will become superior in all their [[Natural and acquired competencies|advantaged competencies]]. There is a lot of [[Ingredients for HPI Development|luck and grit is necessary for high intellectual potential.]]

However, we need to remember that HPI is not all sunshine and rainbows with some [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|notable downsides]].

## Main Phases of Talent Development

There are three main phases for talent development^[Subotnik, R. F., Olszewski-Kubilius, P., & Worrell, F. C. (2018). Talent development as the most promising focus of giftedness and gifted education. In S. I. Pfeiffer, E. Shaunessy-Dedrick, & M. Foley-Nicpon (Eds.), _APA handbook of giftedness and talent_ (pp. 231–245). American Psychological Association. [https://doi.org/10.1037/0000038-015](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0000038-015)]

1. Onset
2. Peak
3. Culmination

Not many will undergo the [[High intellectual potential to talent conversion funnel|talent conversion funnel]]

### Onset is falling in love with a subject

The gifted child falls in *literal* love with a certain subject, idea, or activity in a [[Recognize your circle of competence|specific domain of interest]] which [[Find your niche|brings them intense pleasure and joy]] During this phase, they may become [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|energetic, excited and more enthusiastic than usual]]. It's the emergence of passion.

This may be lost due to a passage of time, looking to satisfy [[Shame and guilt are inherited|external expectations]] such as a pressure from an adult (parent/teacher) or a change in [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]].

> [!NOTE] A comment on internalized guilt disrupting this process
> I wonder if this is why [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame]] is so damaging to people's self-esteem. It creates a bad superego ([[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]]). The message I was told growing up was 'just stop thinking' by my family and my parents.
>
> I love thinking about [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]] and learning how the brain works and what motivates our behaviors - hence me going over [[La Douance -  Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et Créatif by Marianne Belanger]] like a reading demon.

### Peak is the integration of passion into identity

With time, this passion will gradually morph into the child's identity, being internalized as a core personality trait. The gifted child will pour all their effort, creativity and dedication in the goal of converting their [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]] into a [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|mastery of skills, knowledge, values and surrounding culture of their chosen interest]].

For example, one may start [[Identify with your goals|identifying one's self]] as a sports person, a musical person, etc. I guess for me - that's biking? I'm a bike guy lol.

### Culmination occurs when one hears their voice

The moment where the child hears *their "voice"* and sets their determined course towards a [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]] %%[[My career mission|my career mission]]%%, high performance goals, or [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|innovative product]]. This is the start of a marathon - an [[Success requires time and patience|endurance phase towards success]].

During this period in time, the child will need unconditional support from family and experts to achieve their goals.

Some [[Success requires time and patience|talents may take longer to emerge]] such as a gift in finance as it requires [[Learn anything like Feynman|establishing foundational knowledge]].

#### Formula for Unique Talent

> [!NOTE] Talent formula
> Unique Talent = Individual trajectory x Chosen domain

> [!NOTE] On hearing voices and my calling?
> WTF - that sounds like my moment of enlightenment around the period of [[2023-01-01]]. I felt like the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]] was about  [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|recognizing connections]] which has me interested in [[Neural Network]] as it's a representation of how we as humans connect to the world

> I feel like my [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|inner internal voice]]  had quieted and started changing to think that my thought processes were beautiful and kind.
