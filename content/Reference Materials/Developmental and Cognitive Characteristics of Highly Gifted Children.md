## Overview of the Paper

This study covers the interesting field of the development in [[High intellectual potential overview|gifted children]] which is often neglected in pediatrics because psychomotor development data are still rare, since “gifted” children are generally noticed towards the end of their primary schooling by IQ measurement.

Developmental studies have shown the evidence from several fields that children identified as “high-level potentialities” or “intellectually gifted” **develop sensory, locomotor, neuropsychological, and language skills earlier than typically expected.** The hypothesis is offered that the earlier development originates from biological processes affecting the physical development of the brain and in turn even intellectual abilities are developed earlier, potentially allowing for advanced development.

Further it is discussed how these developmental advances interact with the social environment and in certain circumstances may entail increased risk for developing socioemotional difficulties and learning disabilities that often go unaddressed due to the masking by the advance intellectual abilities.

## Section 1: Introduction

This section provides an overview of the study's purpose, which is to understand the developmental and cognitive characteristics of highly gifted children. The author discusses the importance of identifying these children and providing appropriate support and education to help them reach their full potential.

## 2. Identification of “High-Level Potentialities” (Highly Gifted) Children

In this section, the author describes different methods for identifying highly gifted children, including IQ tests, achievement tests, teacher nominations, and parent nominations. The author also notes that identification is not always straightforward and can be influenced by cultural biases.

## 3. Sensory-Motor and Cognitive Development

This section explores the intellectual characteristics of highly gifted children, including their exceptional memory, advanced problem-solving skills, and ability to learn quickly. The author also notes that these children may have a strong need for intellectual stimulation and may become bored with typical classroom activities.

## 4. Psychoaffective Development and Behaviour

Here, the author discusses the social and emotional characteristics of highly gifted children. They may struggle with social interactions due to their advanced cognitive abilities but may also have strong [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|empathy]] and moral reasoning skills. The author emphasizes the importance of providing these children with opportunities for socialization with peers who share similar abilities.

### Cognitive Development during Childhood

#### Cognitive Development in Early Childhood

This section focuses on cognitive development in early childhood for highly gifted children. The author notes that these children often show advanced language skills at a young age and may have a larger vocabulary than their peers. They also tend to excel in areas such as math and science.

#### Cognitive Development in Middle Childhood

In this section, the author discusses cognitive development in middle childhood for highly gifted children. These children often continue to excel academically but may struggle with social relationships or emotional regulation during this time period.

#### Cognitive Development in Adolescence

Here, the author explores cognitive development during adolescence for highly gifted children. These individuals may experience intense emotions or existential questions as they grapple with their advanced intellectual abilities.

## 6. Learning Disabilities

## 7. Conclusion

 Educational Approaches for Highly Gifted Children

The final section of the paper examines educational approaches that are effective for highly gifted children. The author emphasizes the importance of providing acceleration opportunities such as grade skipping or dual enrollment programs as well as enrichment activities outside of school. The author also suggests that teachers should use differentiated instruction strategies to meet the needs of these students in the classroom.
