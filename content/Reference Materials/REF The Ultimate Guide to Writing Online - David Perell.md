# The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online - David Perell

## Personal Notes

[[Richard Yang]] shared this article with me to see if I was interested in getting into content writing creation. For him it's a way of achieving financial freedom and increase his mind share in the market by being noticed.

I read through some of it and I think it's very good advice. However, at this time I don't think it's for me. I enjoy writing for myself and I don't really want to turn it into [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|a job]]. I can see how for many people was very successful as a method of achieving success but I want to become an expert in a different way.

Here are some of the comments to him:

- Writing from abundance seems like the zettelkasten method and evergreen notes. My [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|writing style emulates Andy Matuschak]].
- Personal monopoly makes me think of [[My core values define what matters|authenticity]] and your presented self as a brand which is presented in the book [[The Presentation of Self in Contemporary Social Life by David Shulman|The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life]]
- Ambient research seems similar to my [[My book note-taking process|book note taking process]] of creating atomic notes as I finish. Information diet is something I learned via the nuances of [[Working memory is limited|information overload]] and  [[Information overconsumption|information overconsumption]]  . The counterpoint to the dangers of consumption is the [[Firehose of Falsehood|firehose of falsehood]].
- I'm wary of falling into the collector's fallacy so I introduce friction on my reading collections by forcing myself to copy paste urls into google keep which is my fleeting notes app as I go for daily walks and observations.
