> ### Introduction
>
> - Our refusal to forgive ourselves for mistakes is rooted in the belief that they could have been avoided.
> - We obsessively dwell on our errors and compare them with alternative paths that could have been taken.
> - This leads to pain and self-interrogation about our lack of foresight, self-restraint, and discretion.
>
> ### Endless Self-Punishment
>
> - Punitive self-interrogations continue without relief, intensifying [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] and feelings of inadequacy.
> - [[Social comparison|Comparing ourselves to others]] who seem to make impeccable choices worsens our self-esteem.
> - We may even contemplate extreme measures like suicide due to overwhelming self-loathing.
>
> ### Need for a Different Approach
>
> - To escape perpetual self-hatred, we must adopt a holistic and objective perspective.
> - Our mistakes are a result of our human nature, which inherently lacks the knowledge and experience to ensure perfection.
> - We navigate life with limited awareness of who to marry, our true talents, economic fluctuations, and unforeseen risks.
> - Assumptions and social norms can change, leading to unforeseen consequences and indecencies.
>
> ### Acknowledging the Human Condition
>
> - While we may have experienced specific hardships, suffering and error are widespread in the human experience.
> - It is crucial to recognize the role of luck in shaping outcomes, and the impact of unfortunate circumstances on our lives.
> - We should avoid comparing ourselves solely to those who are more successful, but consider the vast number of people who have endured similar or worse destinies.
>
> ### Unique Circumstances and Sympathy
>
> - Instead of equating ourselves with superficially similar individuals, we should acknowledge the unique burdens and challenges we have faced.
> - [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|Empathy]] and understanding towards our own specific circumstances are essential for self-nurturing.
>
> ### Balancing Regret and Self-Compassion
>
> - While some regret can be constructive for self-improvement, excessive self-hatred serves no purpose.
> - Our foolishness does not make us uniquely awful but is a shared characteristic of [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|being human]].
> - We deserve boundless sympathy and compassion as members of the human race.
