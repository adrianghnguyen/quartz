# Rules for Biologically Inspired Adaptive Network Design

## Paper's Key Findings

> In a recent article published in Science, Toshiyuki Nakagaki outlines a set of rules for designing adaptive networks inspired by biological systems. These rules aim to improve the efficiency and adaptability of network design.
>
> 1. The first rule is to prioritize decentralization. In biological systems, decentralized networks allow for efficient communication and adaptation in response to changing conditions. Similarly, decentralized networks in technology can improve efficiency and resilience.
> 2. The second rule is to incorporate redundancy. Biological systems often have redundant pathways to ensure functionality even if one pathway fails. Incorporating redundancy into network design can increase reliability and reduce the risk of system failure.
> 3. The third rule is to allow for self-organization. In biological systems, self-organization allows for flexible adaptation without requiring centralized control. Allowing for self-organization in technology can lead to more efficient and adaptive networks.
> 4. The fourth rule is to embrace diversity. Biological systems often have diverse components that contribute to overall functionality and adaptability. Incorporating diversity into network design can lead to improved efficiency and resilience.
>
> By following these rules, Nakagaki believes that designers can create more adaptable and efficient networks that are better equipped to handle changing conditions and unexpected events.

## Miniature Transport Engineers

In its vegetative phase, the slime mold *Physarum polycephalum* “slimes” its way through the world seeking food. As it explores, it links previously found food sources with tubular structures. **Tero *et al.*** (p. [439](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1177894)) report that if food sources are deposited on a plate in a pattern corresponding in miniature to the positions of the cities that surround Tokyo, the resulting network of *Physarum* tubules that develops is rather similar in structure to the railroad network that connects the Japanese cities. A model was produced that describes the adaptive network development displayed by the slime mold. This biologically inspired model might provide insight into how to implement properties like resistance of transport systems to local failures into similar human-designed systems.

## Abstract

Transport networks are ubiquitous in both social and biological systems. Robust network performance involves a complex trade-off involving cost, transport efficiency, and fault tolerance. Biological networks have been honed by many cycles of evolutionary selection pressure and are likely to yield reasonable solutions to such combinatorial optimization problems. Furthermore, they develop without centralized control and may represent a readily scalable solution for growing networks in general. We show that the slime mold *Physarum polycephalum* forms networks with comparable efficiency, fault tolerance, and cost to those of real-world infrastructure networks—in this case, the Tokyo rail system. The core mechanisms needed for adaptive network formation can be captured in a biologically inspired mathematical model that may be useful to guide network construction in other domains.
