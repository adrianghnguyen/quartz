## Abstract

%%make it easy to delete under a heading%%

Being happy and finding life meaningful overlap, but there are important differences. A large survey revealed multiple differing predictors of happiness (controlling for meaning) and [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|meaningfulnesss]] (controlling for happiness). [[Satisfaction is the ability to be content|Satisfying oneâ€™s needs and wants increased happiness]] but was largely irrelevant to meaningfulness.

[[The Happiness Equation|Happiness]] was largely present oriented, whereas meaningfulness involves integrating past, present, and future.

For example, [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|thinking about future and past]] was associated with high meaningfulness but low happiness. Happiness was linked to being a taker rather than a giver, whereas meaningfulness went with being a giver rather than a taker.

Higher levels of worry, [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|stress]], and [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] were linked to higher meaningfulness but lower happiness. Concerns with personal [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|identity]] and expressing the self contributed to meaning but not happiness.

We offer brief composite sketches of the unhappy but meaningful life and of the happy but meaningless life.
