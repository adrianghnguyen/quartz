# Most of Your Training Should Be EASY Polarized Training With Dr Stephen Seiler

## Introduction

- The video discusses polarized training and its impact on improving performance in endurance sports.
- Dr. Stephen Seiler, a researcher known for coining the term "polarized training," is the guest in the video.

## Background on Polarized Training

- Polarized training was not invented but observed in athletes through [[Experiment by testing new ideas|trial and error]] over decades.
- Dr. Seiler respected the knowledge of coaches and athletes and aimed to quantify their training methods.
- The conventional interpretation of research literature did not match what he observed in the training environment.
- Dr. Seiler published papers on polarized training and has been trying to understand its meaning and implications.

## Key Concepts of Polarized Training

- The best endurance athletes train with large volumes of their total training at a comfortable intensity below the lactate turn point.
- They also incorporate smaller amounts of high-intensity training above the lactate turn point.
- Initially, a three-zone model was used, but subsequent research suggested that training can be simplified to a low-stress zone and a high-stress zone.
- Good endurance training requires a balance between volume and intensity.

## Implementation of Low-Intensity Rides

- A common mistake is accelerating towards a moderate or threshold level during low-intensity rides.
- Discipline and understanding the goal of each training session are crucial.
- The best athletes show discipline and let others pass them during low-intensity rides while focusing on their training objectives.

## Applicability of Polarized Training

- Polarized training can be effective even for athletes with limited training time (5 to 7 hours per week).
- Athletes who focus on appropriate intensity during long rides and balance their training show improvements.
- The most common training error for amateur athletes is training too hard, rather than not training hard enough.

## Rest Days and Stress Management

- Rest days are essential for recovery and managing stress loads.
- Rest days can also free up time for other responsibilities and activities.
- Balancing rest and training is crucial for long-term performance and well-being.

## Pyramidal Training vs. Polarized Training

- Pyramidal training and polarized training are different concepts.
- The term "polarized" has been used inappropriately, and the distribution of stress varies based on event duration, season, and individual factors.
- Both threshold sessions and high-intensity interval sessions can be considered high-stress workouts, depending on the context.

## Areas for Future Research

- More research is needed to understand the interaction between training intensity and duration.
- Further investigation into the relationship between training load and stress is necessary.
- Dr. Seiler is working on research related to stress in endurance training.

## Conclusion

- Dr. Seiler's YouTube channel is recommended for more information.
- Viewers are encouraged to like, subscribe, and share the video with others interested in cycling.
