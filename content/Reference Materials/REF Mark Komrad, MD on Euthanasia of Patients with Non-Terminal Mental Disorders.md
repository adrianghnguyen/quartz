It's important to note that this talk about the [[Ethics of euthanasia|ethics of euthanasia]] was held at the de Nicole Center for Ethics and Culture. Its mission is to to discuss ethic, culture, and public policy.

We should be aware that this may [[Subjectivity is implied|provide a bias towards messages]] which are in line Catholic morals and intellectual tradition.

> In this text, Margaret, who works in the research and publications program at the Center for Ethics and Culture, welcomes the audience to a lecture on euthanasia. She discusses the center's mission to promote the Catholic moral and intellectual tradition and engage in discussions about ethics, culture, and public policy. The speaker for the evening is Dr. Mark Conrad, an ethicist who has extensive experience in psychiatry and medical ethics. Dr. Conrad has been involved in crafting ethical guidelines for euthanasia and has consulted with policymakers in various countries to discourage the legalization of physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia, especially for psychiatric patients. He also maintains a private practice and frequently appears in media to discuss psychiatric topics. The format of the event includes a Q&A session after Dr. Conrad's lecture, followed by a reception.

> The author's personal stance on euthanasia is against it. They express their opposition throughout the text by presenting various arguments and examples against the practice. They argue that euthanasia should not be considered a right and that it is not the duty of physicians to provide it. They criticize the idea of transforming suicide from a freedom into a right, and they believe that suicide prevention is an important aspect of psychiatric treatment. The author also highlights the potential risks of suicide contagion and coercion, and they argue that euthanasia goes against the fundamental ethos of being a physician. Overall, the author's stance can be described as firmly opposed to euthanasia.

> In this text, the author discusses a significant and disturbing issue that has transformed their life and perspective. They describe how they have gone from being an ethicist and consultant in clinical situations to an activist due to the impact of this issue. The author suggests that this issue has inverted the fundamental principles of ethics and the mission of being a physician, particularly a psychiatrist. They specifically focus on the topic of suicide and how it is defined. While the Centers for Disease Control defines suicide as death caused by self-directed behavior with an intent to die, the American Association of Suicidology has decided to create a distinction between suicide and physician-assisted deaths. The author expresses disbelief at this distinction and believes that it hides remarkable practices that have been hiding in plain sight. They highlight Belgian law allowing euthanasia for patients with severe and incurable distress, including psychological disorders. The author concludes by referencing an article that discusses how in Belgium, psychiatrists can prescribe a fatal dose of sodium thiopental to chronically depressed patients who express a desire to die.

## My personal notes on the lectures

- I'm honestly pretty shocked that psychiatric or mental health professionals are not involved in the loop on the decision of care.
- I believe I have previously reread somewhere that depression and some other types of mental illnesses end up being temporary states of [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional suffering]]. I don't have a source to back this up. It probably doesn't extend to all of them.
	- Amongst the top reasons for assisted suicide are loss of autonomy, dignity and control of body light functions. Most of these stem from fear and anxiety rather  driven by physical suffering or physical pain.
- Some countries have stopped making a distinction between physical and mental suffering when it comes to euthanasia
- Modern medical values with the Hippocratic Oath stand in opposition to euthanasia.
- The practices of euthanasia for non-mental health disorders is rising across the world as it is becoming more popular in legislation.
- There is currently a debate around the concept of assistive suicide for rational suicide, even without a health condition.
- When some physicians consciously object to administrating assisted suicide, some people turn towards end of life clinics.

## Organizations have their unique stance definitions of suicide

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The text mentions two organizations, namely the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Association of Suicidology (AAS), that provide different definitions and positions on suicide.
> The Centers for Disease Control defines suicide as death caused by self-directed behavior with an intent to die. This definition focuses on the act of intentionally taking one's own life and does not make any distinction based on the circumstances or methods involved.
> On the other hand, the American Association of Suicidology has created a distinction between suicide and physician-assisted deaths. While the text does not explicitly mention their definition of suicide, it suggests that AAS views suicide as distinct from cases where a physician assists in ending a patient's life. This implies that AAS acknowledges a difference between self-directed suicides and medically assisted deaths.
> Regarding euthanasia, the text brings up Belgian law as an example. It states that Belgian law allows euthanasia for patients with severe and incurable distress, including psychological disorders. Euthanasia refers to the intentional act of ending someone's life to relieve their suffering, typically performed by a medical professional.
> In summary, the Centers for Disease Control defines suicide based on self-directed behavior with an intent to die, while the American Association of Suicidology appears to differentiate between suicides and physician-assisted deaths. Additionally, the text mentions Belgian law allowing euthanasia for patients with severe distress, including psychological disorders.

## A case study about Belgium assisted suicide gone poorly

The lecture plays this documentary [24 & ready to die - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWWkUzkfJ4M)

> In the recent film, “[24 and Ready to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWWkUzkfJ4M),” the story of Emily, a young Belgian woman who suffers from severe depression is told. Throughout the film, viewers witness Emily complete the harrowing process of planning her death, burial, and even her own funeral. Emily’s friends and mother, who sadly but willingly assist her in planning her death tell their sides of the story. Her mother, who supports the euthanasia, says that there is not another way to help her daughter, and that (quite ironically) “she’ll lose her” if she does not support her in the decision to kill herself.
>
> At the very last minute, Emily decides against going through with the euthanasia. Many speculate that once Emily knew with certainty that she could die, she could live with less anxiety, an argument that is often touted by pro-euthanasia supporters. The problem with this argument, however, is that while depression is a serious medical condition, euthanasia is not the solution.^[https://iycoalition.org/6057-2/]

## History of euthanasia

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Euthanasia is a controversial practice that involves administering death to patients who request it due to suffering or other reasons. The text focuses on psychiatric euthanasia in Belgium and the Netherlands, where psychiatric patients are given the option of assisted suicide by the same physicians who were previously trying to prevent their suicide. The author aims to raise awareness about this practice, as many people are unaware of its existence.
>
> The text discusses various terms used to describe these procedures, such as physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia. Assisted dying, or passive euthanasia, is currently the ethical status quo, allowing patients to refuse treatment or have life-sustaining measures removed with the hope of receiving palliative care. Physician-assisted suicide involves a doctor prescribing barbiturates for a patient to take at their own discretion. Euthanasia, on the other hand, entails actively killing a patient through an intravenous injection administered by a physician.
>
> The historical roots of euthanasia and medical ethics are explored. In ancient Greece, euthanasia meant a good death provided by physicians. However, in the Hippocratic school of medicine, an oath was taken that explicitly forbade giving a fatal drug to anyone upon request. This value of protecting life under all circumstances has been upheld for centuries in the medical profession.
>
> The text also highlights the role of psychiatrists in developing methods of mass killing during the Holocaust. Alfred Hoche's book on allowing the destruction of life unworthy of life became influential in Hitler's regime and contributed to the T4 program, which targeted mentally ill individuals for mass killings. Leo Alexander, a psychiatrist from Harvard, oversaw the doctors' trials at Nuremberg and emphasized how this shift in attitude towards non-rehabilitatable patients led to larger-scale atrocities against various groups.
>
> Overall, the author believes it is important to ring the alarm bell about psychiatric euthanasia practices and warns that this phenomenon may spread to other countries. The text serves as a call to protect the values of the medical profession and uphold the sanctity of life.

## Most popular reasons for assisted suicide

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The text discusses the top reasons why people in Oregon and Washington report wanting assisted suicide, such as losing autonomy, dignity, and control of bodily functions. It highlights that these reasons all stem from fear and anxiety, rather than solely being driven by pain. The author, a psychiatrist, believes that mental health professionals should be involved in the process of assisted suicide because they have the skills to address and alleviate fear. However, it is noted that mental health professionals are not currently required in the process. The text also mentions that the debate around assisted suicide is expanding to include the concept of rational suicide in general, even without a health condition. The idea of extending autonomy and self-determination to anyone who wishes to have access to means of suicide is being discussed, echoing similar conversations happening in Europe.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Based on the text, the top reasons for wanting assisted suicide are:
> 1. Loss of autonomy: Individuals may want assisted suicide because they fear losing control over their own lives and decisions.
> 2. Loss of dignity: The fear of losing dignity in the face of a deteriorating health condition can be a significant reason for wanting assisted suicide.
> 3. Loss of control of bodily functions: The text suggests that individuals may desire assisted suicide to avoid the potential loss of control over their bodily functions, which could lead to a diminished quality of life.
> 4. Fear and anxiety: These emotions are described as underlying the reasons for wanting assisted suicide, suggesting that individuals may want to end their lives due to psychological distress.

## Diagnosing for euthanasia

### Defining suffering in the euthanasia context

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Euthanasia in Canada has evolved over time, starting in 2016 with the introduction of the concept of medical assistance in dying (MAID). Initially, MAID was limited to terminally ill patients with a prognosis of six to twelve months to live. However, in 2017, the law was expanded to include cases where death is "reasonably foreseeable," without a specific definition. This expansion raised concerns about excluding psychiatric patients, leading to calls for inclusion under the principles of parity and non-discrimination. A study group is expected to rule on this matter soon. Euthanasia has gained popularity in Canada, with a 30% increase in cases from the first half to the second half of 2017. The Canadian Association for Retired People supports euthanasia and calls for all publicly funded institutions, including Catholic hospitals, to provide MAID. Conscientious objectors among physicians face challenges as they are required to provide an effective referral for MAID even if they are unwilling to administer it themselves. In Ontario, both ethically and legally, physicians must be part of the referral chain. The courts have ruled that conscience rights are not legally permissible, and physicians must find a way to assist patients seeking euthanasia or face consequences. Some scholars argue that conscientious objection is merely a disguise for squeamishness and call for reforming the minds of young physicians through education on euthanasia. This trend reflects a remarkable shift towards acceptance and normalization of euthanasia in Canada, influenced by European models where euthanasia is more established.

> In the context of euthanasia, the patient is considered the ultimate expert to determine their own criteria for suffering and treatment options. European models do not distinguish between physical and mental suffering, considering all forms of suffering as equal. Patients also have the right to refuse certain treatments, even if they are effective. In Canada, euthanasia is predominantly practiced, with the criteria being that death must be reasonably foreseeable, although this concept is not clearly defined. There is a push to extend euthanasia to psychiatric patients and minors in Canada. The country has experienced a significant increase in euthanasia cases, with over 2,600 cases reported in 2017. The Canadian Association for Retired People supports euthanasia and calls for publicly funded institutions to provide medical assistance in dying (MAID), including Catholic hospitals. However, some doctors are conscientious objectors to euthanasia and do not want to participate. In Ontario, doctors are required to provide an effective referral if they refuse to perform euthanasia themselves. Conscience rights are not legally permissible in Ontario, and doctors must find a way to help their patients access euthanasia if they refuse to perform it themselves.

### European model of euthanasia criteria

This is apparently also known as the European model of criteria for euthanasia.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Based on the text, the criteria for euthanasia in the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) include the following:
> 1. The condition must be unbearable or insufferable, as determined by the patient.
> 2. The condition must be untreatable, and the patient has the right to refuse treatment.
> 3. There are no distinctions made between terminal and non-terminal conditions or between physical and mental suffering.
> 4. Advanced directives for dementia are allowed, with some limitations.
> 5. There is no explicit prohibition on euthanasia tourism, meaning non-citizens can also have access to euthanasia services.
> 6. Euthanasia is more common than assisted suicide, and it is often done by appointment with a physician present during medication administration.
>
> It is worth noting that the criteria for euthanasia are evolving in the Netherlands, with discussions about extending it to include people who are tired of living or have completed life, as well as medicalizing the criteria further by removing the requirement for chronic or terminal illness.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The text discusses the origins and current state of euthanasia in the Benelux countries, particularly the Netherlands. In 2002, these countries passed laws making euthanasia and assisted suicide legal, removing distinctions between terminal and non-terminal conditions as well as physical and mental suffering. As a result, psychiatric patients began to seek euthanasia when their mental suffering became unbearable and untreatable. The Netherlands has seen a significant increase in euthanasia cases, with over 7,000 people being euthanized in 2017 alone. Psychiatric patients represent a small percentage of those euthanized but their numbers are growing. There are two paths available for euthanasia in the Netherlands: through a personal physician or through a special clinic known as an end-of-life clinic. While some physicians have objected to euthanizing psychiatric patients, many have complied with the law and provided the service. The medical societies in the Netherlands have also supported euthanasia, providing guidelines for evaluations and procedures. However, there is some pushback against euthanizing psychiatric patients, leading to discussions about expanding the criteria to include those who are simply tired of living or feel they have completed life.

## Controversial case studies involving euthanasia

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> There are two cases mentioned in the text.
> The first case involves a woman who was euthanized in 2016 for an autistic spectrum disorder. The author suggests that the diagnosis may have been spurious and that the woman's family was recruited into the decision. The woman's father was allegedly asked to hold the needle while she was being killed by a doctor. The woman's sisters are upset and angry about the euthanasia, and a criminal investigation has been opened against the doctor.
> The second case involves an elderly dementia patient in the Netherlands who had written an advanced directive for euthanasia but then refused when it came time to be euthanized. Despite her refusal and struggles, the family and doctor held her down and successfully administered the lethal injection. The scene was described as terrible, and it is now being investigated for possible prosecution.
> These cases highlight the controversial nature of euthanasia and assisted suicide, particularly when it comes to mental illness or dementia. It raises questions about the appropriateness of these practices and whether proper consent can be obtained in such cases.

### The current state of affairs of euthanasia in Canada

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> In 2014, the Canadian Medical Association began to soften its stance on assisted suicide and euthanasia. This shift in perspective often occurs when medical societies face divisive issues. However, it was a Supreme Court case called Carver versus Canada in 2016 that prompted the Canadian government to address this matter legislatively. The case involved a woman with advanced spinal stenosis who sought permission from the court for her doctor to end her life. In response, the Supreme Court of Canada directed the Parliament to study the issue and develop legislation. Consequently, in June 2016, the c14 law was passed, making assisted suicide and euthanasia legal in certain circumstances. Under this law, individuals can be eligible for these options if their conditions are deemed untreatable and intolerable by medical professionals.
>
> This follows the European model of euthanasia which follows the claim the patient's condition is insufferable and considered irrefutable.

### The current state of affairs of euthanasia in United States

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> In the United States, there are currently eight jurisdictions where physician-assisted suicide is legally allowed for terminally ill individuals. However, the concept of a terminal illness itself is difficult to define and unreliable in medical science. It is important to note that, except for Hawaii, there is no requirement for a mental health assessment before proceeding with physician-assisted suicide. The evaluating physicians do not have to be psychiatrists, and there is no obligation for a psychiatric consultation unless required by the recently instituted law in Hawaii. Additionally, physicians performing this procedure do not need any special training in mental health assessment. While a second opinion is required, it can come from any doctor including one in practice with the patient, which does not ensure true independence. There is no requirement for a prior doctor-patient relationship, allowing for the establishment of clinics solely dedicated to approving these procedures. Furthermore, patients have the right to refuse treatment, even if their decision leads to their condition becoming terminal and making them eligible for physician-assisted suicide. However, physician-assisted suicide cannot be listed on a death certificate as the cause of death, hindering research efforts. Lastly, there are no requirements for witnesses to ensure that the decision is not coerced.

### The current state of affairs of euthanasia in Europe

#### The current state of affairs of euthanasia in the Netherlands

> [!ai]+ AI - The two paths of euthanasia in the Netherlands.
>
> Based on the provided text, there are two paths of euthanasia in the Netherlands:
> 1. Path through personal physician: This path involves working with one's own doctor to seek euthanasia. The physician evaluates the patient's condition and determines if they meet the criteria for euthanasia. If approved, the physician administers the lethal injection. However, if the personal physician is unwilling to perform euthanasia, there is an alternative path available.
> 2. End-of-life clinic: The end-of-life clinic, known as the "Levenseindekliniek," is a special clinic where individuals can seek euthanasia if their personal physician refuses to provide it. The clinic has a team of physicians who travel to different locations and evaluate patients who are new to them. If approved, they administer euthanasia.
> Both paths ultimately lead to planned death through euthanasia, but the end-of-life clinic serves as an alternative option for those whose personal physicians are not willing to perform the procedure.

> The text describes the Catholic Church's involvement in euthanasia in various countries, particularly in the Netherlands and Belgium. It mentions that euthanasia laws were passed in 2002 for unbearable suffering, and there have been calls to expand the criteria for euthanasia, including a completed life criterion. The text also discusses the push for an over-the-counter suicide pill and the growing popularity of the "pill of drienne" approach. It mentions the Dutch voluntary euthanasia Society and their efforts to expand euthanasia criteria, particularly targeting young people. The text also highlights the increase in euthanasia cases in Belgium, including euthanizing children, and the presence of euthanasia suites in hospitals. It mentions that there has been a 900% increase in euthanasia since 2002, with unreported cases estimated to be around 40%. The involvement of psychiatric patients in euthanasia is also discussed. The text mentions Dr. Lee of T and Popin, a prominent figure advocating for euthanasia for psychological suffering, and her controversial decision to deem 14 psychotic patients as competent to make the decision for euthanasia. It also describes various cases where euthanasia was granted for conditions such as major depression, personality disorder, ego-dystonic homosexuality, and transgender individuals unsatisfied with conversion therapy. The text briefly mentions the Catholic Church's opposition to euthanasia in Belgium and the case of the Brothers of Charity who initially refused to allow euthanasia in their facilities but eventually changed their stance under societal pressure. The Pope expressed his disapproval of euthanasia while the chair of the board of the Brothers of Charity defended their decision.

> The text discusses the topic of euthanasia and its increasing prevalence in countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, and Canada. The author mentions the introduction of a "completed life criterion" for medical euthanasia, which allows individuals to access euthanasia based on their perception of having lived a full life. There are also calls for an over-the-counter suicide pill to be made available outside of medical settings. The author, who identifies as a physician grounded in the Hippocratic tradition, expresses some comfort with moving euthanasia out of doctor's offices, although they do not support it as public policy.
> The text highlights the popularity of the "pill of drienne," named after a retired Supreme Court justice who advocated for this approach. It mentions the Dutch voluntary euthanasia Society, a grassroots organization that aims to expand the criteria for euthanasia in the Netherlands. The organization appeals to young people, particularly those under 40, to advocate for expanding euthanasia criteria. The author notes that there is a week of euthanasia held annually in February, which includes seminars on topics such as organ donation as a virtue opportunity.
> The text then shifts its focus to Belgium, where there has been a significant increase in euthanasia since the passing of the euthanasia law in 2002. It mentions that Belgium has euthanasia suites in hospitals and that there is no lower age limit for euthanasia. Euthanasia tourism is also allowed, although it is mostly non-psychiatric cases. The author notes that there has been a 900 percent increase in euthanasia overall and a 14 percent increase between 2015 and 2016 alone. There are concerns about underreporting, with an estimated 40 percent of euthanasias going unreported.
> The text provides examples of various cases where euthanasia has been granted, including cases involving psychiatric patients. It mentions Dr. Lee of T and Pop, who is known as the psychiatric Kevorkian of the Netherlands and has euthanized patients with various psychiatric diagnoses. The author expresses concern about the competence of some patients, particularly those who are psychotic. The text also describes cases involving twins going blind, a young man unhappy with his homosexuality, and a transgender man who had undergone unsuccessful conversion therapy.
> The text briefly mentions the Catholic Church's stance on euthanasia in Belgium, including a case where a nursing home patient was not allowed to be euthanized and the subsequent decision by the Brothers of Charity to allow euthanasia in their facilities. The Pope opposed this decision, but the Brothers of Charity stuck to their decision and may remove the Catholic Church name from their hospital systems.
> Overall, the text provides an overview of the increasing prevalence of euthanasia in certain countries and raises questions about its expanding criteria and potential ethical concerns.

### Euthanasia tourism

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Based on the provided text, euthanasia tourism refers to the practice of traveling to a different country to undergo euthanasia or assisted suicide. The text states that there is no explicit prohibition of tourism for euthanasia in the Benelux countries (Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg), meaning that individuals from other countries can access euthanasia services in these countries without being citizens. It is mentioned that most of the euthanasia cases in these countries are performed by appointment, where the physician watches the patient take medication.

## Stances on euthanasia

### Psychiatric association positions on the euthanasia for the non-terminally

> The APA position implies that, even where legal for the non-terminally ill, it is neither the duty of a psychiatrist to fulfill that right, nor is it ethically appropriate to do so. Some (in the Belgian press) have argued that an American association does not have a place in the discussion of medical and psychiatric practices, which make most sense when seen in the context of different cultures. However, there is an understanding in the domain of medical ethics that there are some principles that transcend cultures.
>
> The Ethics Committee of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA) has crafted a position similar to that of the APA, which will be submitted for a membership vote at the 2017 World Congress in Berlin. If endorsed, the WPA would be acknowledging that, on this particular issue, the ethical proscription against helping psychiatric patients to commit suicide may be so antithetical to the fundamental ethos of psychiatry that it should indeed be applied worldwide.^[https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/apa-position-medical-euthanasia]

> - The practice of euthanasia and assisted suicide has expanded beyond helping terminally ill patients and now includes non-terminal conditions, mental illnesses, discomfort with one's sexuality, and other minor ailments.
> - This expansion can lead to controversial practices such as suicide tourism and over-the-counter suicide pills.
> - Ethical arguments in favor of euthanasia and assisted suicide include concepts of justice, autonomy, and relief of suffering.
> - Counterarguments emphasize the importance of keeping the roles of comfort provider and bringer of death separate, raising concerns about providing euthanasia to mentally ill patients, and discussing issues such as suicide contagion and coercion.
> - The responsibility of transforming suicide from a freedom into a right should be assigned to the government rather than physicians, with a separate profession outside of medicine being responsible for this duty.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The detailed argument against euthanasia presented in the text can be summarized as follows:
> 1. Spurious diagnosis: The case mentioned in the text suggests that the woman who was euthanized in 2016 might have had a spurious diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder. This raises concerns about the accuracy of diagnoses and the potential for misdiagnosis leading to euthanasia.
> 2. Family involvement: In the case mentioned, the woman's father was asked to hold the needle in place while she was being euthanized, which indicates a level of family involvement in the process. This raises questions about the appropriateness of family members participating in euthanasia procedures.
> 3. Criminal investigation: The fact that a criminal investigation has been opened into the doctor involved in this particular case indicates that there are concerns about the legality and ethics of the euthanasia procedure.
> 4. Slippery slope: The text argues that legalizing euthanasia for terminally ill patients often leads to its expansion to non-terminal cases, such as those with mental illnesses or discomfort with one's own lifestyle. The progression from one category to another is seen as a slippery slope, with potentially dire consequences for vulnerable individuals.
> 5. Autonomy and coercion: The text suggests that autonomy and self-determination, often cited as arguments in favor of euthanasia, may not be fully achievable for individuals with mental disorders or those facing societal pressures. There is a concern that coercion or external influences can undermine true autonomy in end-of-life decisions.
> 6. Suicide contagion: The text highlights studies that have shown an increase in suicide rates following media attention or discussions around assisted suicide. This raises concerns about the potential negative impact of legalizing euthanasia on vulnerable individuals, including those who may be influenced by suicide contagion.
> 7. Inversion of psychiatric principles: The argument presented is that psychiatrists, as healthcare professionals, have a duty to prevent suicide and provide support to patients in times of suffering. To transition from preventing suicide to providing assistance in suicide is seen as a betrayal of their vocation and profession.
> 8. Ethical considerations: The text argues that major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association and the World Medical Association, consider euthanasia to be fundamentally incompatible with the role of physicians as healers. The ethical arguments against euthanasia are based on concerns about the sanctity of life, the potential for abuse, and the erosion of trust in the medical profession.
> Overall, the argument against euthanasia presented in the text emphasizes concerns about accuracy in diagnoses, family involvement, legality and ethics, the potential for a slippery slope, autonomy and coercion, suicide contagion, the inversion of psychiatric principles, and ethical considerations.

They emphasize the importance of keeping the roles of comfort provider and bringer of death separate, arguing that physicians should not be responsible for administering death. The author also points out the limitations in accurately diagnosing mental illnesses and predicting prognosis in psychiatry, which raises concerns about providing euthanasia to mentally ill patients. Additionally, they discuss issues such as suicide contagion and coercion.
