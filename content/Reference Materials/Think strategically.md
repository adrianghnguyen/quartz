> Strategic thinking is about meta thinking, or thinking about your thought process. It's not about reacting to daily headlines but forming a worldview based on perceived patterns in various aspects of life. This type of thinking requires [[Question underlying assumptions|constantly questioning and assessing the relevancy of your worldview]] as the world changes.
>
> Strategic thinkers are curious, [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|open to different viewpoints]], and comfortable admitting their mistakes. They treat contrasting perspectives not as adversarial but as [[Use grey thinking to see from multiple perspectives|different ways of understanding the world]]. An aptitude for strategic thinking can be cultivated through regular practice, similar to a physical workout.
>
> Fostering a strong sense of empathy for others' stories helps cultivate strategic thinking. Recognizing and understanding the narratives of others, regardless of how different or challenging they may be from one's own, is a crucial component.
>
> Nelson Mandela, for his exceptional moral courage, personal conviction, and ability to take a long-term view for his country's future, stands as a prime example of a strategic thinker. His approach was grounded in upholding values and ethics, revealing the importance of human development in strategic thinking.
>
> Therefore, strategic thinking goes beyond mere reaction to daily events. It calls for a constant examination of one's beliefs, acceptance of different perspectives, and maintains a long-term view.

> Becoming a better strategist in life requires a shift from constantly reacting to having proactive responses. Embracing strategic thinking can help you gain power and control over your situations. However, most people often find themselves in a 'tactical hell' - a state where they are always reacting to what others say or do, instead of orchestrating their own course of action.
>
> The key to escape this tactical hell is to enter into 'strategic heaven', which involves altering how you perceive situations. Instead of reacting impulsively to events or remarks, it's important to pause and discern the best rational response. This way, you donâ€™t fall prey to others who may deliberately push your buttons for their advantage.
>
> A part of becoming a strategist in life is to keep in mind that not everything is about winning. Sometimes, a 'superior victory' where you publicly overpower or embarrass someone could foster resentment, which might harm you later. Therefore, thinking about the consequences of your actions is essential.
>
> The ability to detach oneself emotionally and consider numerous responses apart from immediate reactions gives you options and brings power into your life. By practising this shift from constantly reacting to thinking strategically, you become a more effective strategist in life.

## Planning differs from strategy

> [!note] AI Summary on [[2023-08-31]]
> Roger Martin discusses the difference between the common practices of planning and strategy within businesses. He argues that while planning is a process of laying out actions to be done, it lacks coherence and doesn't guarantee a company's success. On the other hand, strategy, which he defines as an integrative set of choices that positions a company on a playing field of their choice, can lead to a competitive outcome. This difference has impacts: planning is about managing controllable costs, while strategy is about influencing outcomes beyond the firm's control, like customer choices. He also warns against the comfort trap of planning, which, while more predictable and comfort inducing, does not necessarily lead to effective competitive outcomes.
>
> Martin provides the example of Southwest Airlines, which had a unique strategy that eventually made it the largest U.S. airline in terms of passenger seat miles. The dominant carriers were simply planning without a winning strategy in mind, so they were vulnerable when Southwest brought a well-devised strategy to the market.
>
> Martin advises businesses to recognize that strategy has associated worries and risks, since outcomes cannot be known in advance. He recommends laying out strategic logic clearly and remaining flexible to tweak the strategy as the market evolves. He further suggests that successful strategies should be simple and clear, capable of being written on a single page.
