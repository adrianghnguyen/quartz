# Welcome to My Digital Brain

Hi,

It's nice to meet you! My name is Adrian Nguyen. I mainly write for my own sake and not for others. This is not a personal blog so much as a collection of my thinking patterns.

I started this project as a way to work with the garage door up as [inspired by Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up).  This is all powered by [[Why I write in Obsidian|my notes written within Obsidian]] with an automated pipeline to dynamically publish my content. It's also my personal toy project in terms of experimenting with software engineering practices so chances are things get nuked and broken often!
