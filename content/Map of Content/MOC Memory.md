> [!info] Content scope
> Memory is the ability of our brain to store and retrieve information. It helps us remember things like events, people, places, and things we have learned.
>
> Memory works by creating connections between neurons in our brain, and the more we reinforce these connections through repetition or association, the stronger our memory becomes. However, memory can also be affected by factors such as age, [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger]], and sleep deprivation.
