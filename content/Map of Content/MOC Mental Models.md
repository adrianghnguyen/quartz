## What are mental models?

> [!ai] Content scope
>
Mental models are frameworks or representations of how we perceive and understand the world around us. They are mental constructs that help us make sense of complex situations, solve problems, and make decisions. Mental models are formed through our experiences, observations, beliefs, and values, and they shape our perceptions of reality. They can be both conscious and unconscious, and they can be positive or negative depending on their accuracy and usefulness in guiding our actions. Mental models are essential for effective thinking, learning, and communication in various fields such as science, business, psychology, and education.
