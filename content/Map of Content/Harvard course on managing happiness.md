## My summary and learned lesson from the course

[[2023-08-26]]

Finding genuine happiness requires a lot of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]], but it is possible to achieve. A lot of life is about serving others by aspiring to do work which elevates humanity and connects us with love for shared humanity. So it's important to build strong relationships and overcome loneliness.

Humans are wired to have the deck stacked against us in achieving happiness due to how our brains have evolved. Creating happiness and removing happiness are independent processes (neurologically as well) and they can be achieved by key habits such as taking care of our physical health + building compassionate relationships.  
  
Social comparison, social media are poison pills.
