## Computer science related domains related to artificial intelligence

### Collaboration between computer scientists and cognitive scientists

Cognitive scientists and computer scientists may collaborate to develop machine learning algorithms, [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing systems]], or intelligent agents that can simulate human [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|cognitive processes]].

They may also work together to design interfaces that are more user-friendly and intuitive, drawing on their combined knowledge of human cognition and computer science. Overall, the intersection of cognitive science and computer science is a rapidly growing field with many exciting research opportunities.


Field  | What is the field focused on?
---|---
Data Science| a field that focuses on the extraction of insights and knowledge from data using statistical and computational methods. Data science is relevant to AI because it provides the foundation for machine learning algorithms and the training of intelligent systems.
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)| a field that deals with the design, evaluation, and implementation of computer systems that are usable and accessible to humans. HCI is relevant to AI because it concerns the development of interfaces and interaction mechanisms that enable humans to interact with intelligent systems effectively. closel
Philosophy of AI| a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of intelligence, consciousness, and ethics in the context of artificial intelligence. The philosophy of AI is relevant to AI because it provides a framework for thinking about the ethical and societal implications of intelligent systems.
Computer Engineering| a field that combines elements of computer science and electrical engineering to design and develop computer systems and components. Computer engineering is relevant to AI because it provides the hardware and software infrastructure necessary to support the development and deployment of intelligent systems.
