## Thought Log

2023-01-14 | How context spaces affect the way you think and how to prime yourself for productivity
2023-01-14 | Be selective in who you decide to give resources to.
2023-01-14 | Loving people may just be a skill which requires deliberate practice
2023-01-14 | An inquisitive mind, is it related to being able to be a quick learner who is hungry for knowledge and a strategic thinker who looks for relationships which serve to explain the world?
2023-01-14 | When finding a solution, find the minimum viable product which has enough utility to cover the problem space. Then proceed with iteration as you gather feedback and further information.
2023-01-14 | Little nuggets of happiness, little atoms of happiness
2023-01-17 | i had this thought this morning: Mindfulness is the opportunity for me to escape from the treadmill of the monkey mind. It allows the mind to return to its natural resting state and give myself the opportunity - how would >>>I<<< like to think about things by giving myself time and space - rather than it being driven by my anxiety?  If it helps, scientifically, mindfulness and taking the time to identify negative reactions and their source is the root of cognitive behavioral therapy, ergo practicing meditation is doing therapy. When I think of it that way, I see it as truly important to practice mindfulness as much as it is to move in daily life.
2023-01-17 | It takes time for thoughts to settle. Likewise, things to propagate. Therefore, do not become attached as things will come back to you when they hit the appropriate surface and will return as another wave.
2023-01-17 | It's interesting. Here I was writing about habits which led me to explain that it is a result of neuroplasticity. However, to engage further into that topic and really explain what neuroplasticity was - concepts were failing to come to mind. After checking out the article stub I had begun, I can see how I haven'r written enough about it and fully synthesized the information. My brain already knew it didn't know enough about the topic yet before I even went in That's super impressive.
2023-01-23 | If we look at nature (look to nature as inspiration for constant trial and error ie evolution), we see that many organisms evolve to develop connections including pack animals, tree networks. So how do we explain apex and solitary predators. Injuring one organism within a brood has a marginally smaller impact on the the group than injuring a solitary individual who has no one to depend on. As a hand that has many fingers can form a stronger grip, the greater the strength of connections of the organism the more resilient to stresses on its system. However becoming too large means that one loses the ability to become adaptable and so an equilibrium must be achieved. Organisms with quicker evolutionary cycles gain a competitive advantage.
2023-01-30 | High intellectual potential
[[2023-02-15 Wed]] | I realized that my left wrist hurts more than my left in terms of carpal tunnel. I know I have a muscular imbalance with bias towards the left side. Interesting.
[[2023-02-15 Wed]] | A project to put in a topic and spit out the closest match to the dewey decimal system?

[[2023-02-23 Thu]] | writing was not merely a record or trace of what he thought, but rather the medium through which he thought
[[2023-03-11]] | testing
[[2023-03-19]] | Isn't it funny that the people who tend to be problem oriented when they are faced with learned helplessness they just give up and don't provide solutions
