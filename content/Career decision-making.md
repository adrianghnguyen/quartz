## Mapping a list of career options

When finding the right [[Career fit is about finding the right career|career fit]], I should think broadly and be open to opportunities.

- Create a big list of options about careers and think broadly
	- Be careful of sticking only to familiar or most recent experiences
	- Don't cross out options too early
- Understand key uncertainties which may limit how viable a career option may be

### Figure out key uncertainties

> To start, just make some rough guesses: roughly rank your options in terms of personal fit, impact, and supportive conditions for job satisfaction (plus career capital if youâ€™re comparing next steps rather than longer-term paths)
>
> People often find the most important questions are pretty simple things, like:
>
> 1. If I applied to this job, would I get in?
> 2. Would I enjoy this aspect of the job?
> 3. Would the pay be high enough given my student loans?
> 4. Whatâ€™s the day-to-day routine actually like?

### Create a ladder test of commitment and escalation to evaluate a career option

An example:
> 1. Read our relevantÂ [career reviews](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/),Â [all our research on a given topic](https://80000hours.org/research/), and do some Google searches to learn the basics. (1â€“2 hours)
> 2. Speak to someone in the area. (2 hours)
> 3. Speak to three more people who work in the area and read one or two books. (20 hours)
> 4. Consider using some of the additional approaches to predicting successÂ [below](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#personal-fit-questions).
> 5. Given your findings in the previous steps, look for a relevant project that might take 1â€“4 weeks of work â€” like applying to jobs, volunteering in a related role, or doing a side project in the area â€” to see what itâ€™s like and how you perform.
> 6. Only then consider taking on a 2to 24-month commitment â€” like a work placement, internship, or [[Graduate school|graduate study]]. Being offered a trial position with an organisation for a couple of months can be ideal, because both you and the organisation want to quickly assess your fit.

## Try something then iterate on the process

- The more significant the decision such as a [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|major life decision]], the longer time we should spend searching and researching. Simply [[Aiming for satisfactory or adequate results|aiming for satisfactory or adequate results]] may not be enough. Take the time to carefully evaluate and research options.
- Developing good judgment is probably very difficult - maybe [[REF Notes on good judgement and how to develop it|REF Notes on good judgement and how to develop it]] will have further advice on this.
- It's okay to see a [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|career journey]] as part of a [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|series of experiments in life]].

## Dream big for your career when there are high upsides and fallback options exist

- When we have a tolerance for risk and possibility of fallback options
- When we're young, it can be worth taking risks
- We stand the most from to learn the most from trying paths when the upside is really high or things on which we are very uncertain about
- Which option would I [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|regret least]]? It's worth trying the big shot to see if I can fall in love with it and it may move me forward in life.
- Avoid the sunk-cost fallacy of in terms of investment in a career

Also remember the fact that most people who underwent [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|major life changes]] such as career changes often wish they did it [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|earlier rather than later]].


## How to set a career path

Warren buffet's career plan?

Advice from [[Poe Han Thar Kyaw|Poe Han Thar Kyaw]] based on Warren Buffet:
1. Write down all the things you want to achieve in your life.
2. Read and re-read the list to figure out your top three career priorities.
	1. Eg. -  I want to be a top journalist at the NYT
	2. I want to be a trust and safety person helping to create more effective content moderation policies.
	3. I want to be a human rights lawyers within Southeast Asia working on war crimes.
3. Figure out if there is a common thread or threads between them so you can articulate it. Eg. I really value transparency
4. Write out what you can do to help achieve those goals in 1, 5 and 10 years horizon timeline to achieve those goals
5. Highlight the things you have written under each category (year span) that would help you in further all 3 career priorities. Use those as a starting point in terms of actions. If you get started on those actions, then at least you'll be making progress on those objectives as they share a common thread.

The goal of this exercise is to move on from [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]] by providing options which will only further your goal - so there's nothing to hesitate.
