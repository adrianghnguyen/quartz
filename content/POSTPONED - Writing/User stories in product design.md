> _A user story is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer._

A user story helps explain the functionalities and capabilities of software - it helps the development team understand what the end user is supposed to be able to do and for what reason. It's a key process in aligning development expectations in [[Product-design thinking|product design]].

Typically, they're written by a product owner/manager/program manager.

## User stories help keep development focused on value-driven outcomes

A tendency is to fall into the trap of simply creating to-do lists but it might cause us to lose sight of our overall goals, like [[Every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure|missing the forest for the trees]].

User stories provide the following benefits:
1. Value-driven outcomes - Keeps the team focused on problem-solving for real users
2. Enables collaboration - Clarifies the end goal to the team and what the software should be able to do
3. Opens up creative thinking - By focusing on functionality rather than implementation, we avoid becoming pigeon holed
4. Creates momentum - Breaks down big problems into [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|small victories]]

### Example of a user story

> - As a site member, I can fill out an application to become a Certified Scrum Trainer so that I can teach [Certified Scrum Master (CSM)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/certified-scrummaster) and [Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/training/courses/certified-product-owner) courses and certify others.
> - As a trainer, I want my profile to list my upcoming classes and include a link to a detailed page about each so that prospective attendees can find my courses.
> - As a site visitor, I can access old news that is no longer on the home page, so I can access things I remember from the past or that others mention to me.
> - As a site visitor, I can see a list of all upcoming “Certification Courses” and can page through them if there are a lot, so I can choose the best course for me.
