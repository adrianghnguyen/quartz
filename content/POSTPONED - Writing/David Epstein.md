> David Epstein is an author and journalist known for his work on the science of expertise and performance. He explores the idea that success is not solely determined by innate talent or specialization, but rather by a range of factors including deliberate practice, adaptability, and broad experience. Epstein argues that individuals who develop a range of skills and knowledge in different areas tend to be more successful in today's rapidly changing world. His book "Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" delves into the benefits of being a generalist rather than a [[Cult of specialization|specialist]] in various fields. Overall, Epstein challenges the notion that specialization is always the key to success and encourages individuals to embrace diverse interests and experiences.
