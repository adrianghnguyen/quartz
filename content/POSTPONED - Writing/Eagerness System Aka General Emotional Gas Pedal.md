# Eagerness System Aka General Emotional Gas Pedal

#status/postponed

Related to [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center]]

This system of the [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one ring]] is called the *emotional gas pedal* as it increases [[Approach-avoidance behaviours|approach and avoidance behaviours]] which is [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|how we form trust through emotional bonds]].

Eagerness is also linked to the [[Mesolimbic pathway is the emotional center of the brain|mesolimbic pathway]] and is thought to be related to the anticipation of rewards. The release of dopamine in the [[Nucleus accumbens|NAc]] is associated with an increase in motivation and eagerness to obtain the reward.

> When eagerness is activated with the stress response mechanism, we search for safety. When eagerness is activated with the attachment mechanism (see the next chapter), we seek affection. And of course when eagerness is activated with our sexual accelerator, we pursue sexual stimulation.
>
> When eagerness is activated, we experience what Kent Berridge calls “a moment of special temptation.”^[Berridge, Mechanisms of Self-Control. The Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert described Berridge as “one of the best neuroscientists in the world,” (Berridge et al., The Neuroscience of Happiness), but I would distinguish him from other neuroscientists this way: As a source of both the Iggy Pop rat study and the One Ring metaphor, he is the one and only author of rat brain research who has made me LOL.] The experience of urgent craving or yearning is powered by the eagerness system.
