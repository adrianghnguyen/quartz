# The nature of human suffering stems from attachment according to Buddhist philosophy.

According to [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula|Buddhist philosophy]], life is suffering ('dukkha') which stems from our constant attachment to desires as well as being out of touch with the [[Developing wisdom is about being realistic|true nature of reality]]. These lead to inherent dissatisfaction and unsatisfactoriness in life - perhaps tha is why we step onto the [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|hedonic treadmill]]. 

The Four Noble Truths serves as a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]] for understanding and overcoming this suffering by learning how to stop engaging in this process of chasing constant desires. It also leads to the cultivation of wisdom and compassion. Supposedly, recognizing and accepting this suffering as the [[Understanding the complexity of life|way of life]] can allow us to gain enlightment and liberation from the cycle of rebrith.

In terms of personal takeaways, it's about understanding that wanting for more leads us to become [[Minimize sources of unhappiness|unhappy]]. Perhaps that is the danger of [[Social comparison|social comparison]] - it causes us to wish for more. Based on my conversation with my friend %% [[Rebecca Chong|Rebecca Chong]] %%, perhaps that is the importance of cultivating [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-esteem]] - it leads us to stop coveting what is in another's bowl. As James Clear says, keep your eyes on your own work. I should remember this when it comes to [[Career fit is about finding the right career|finding my place in the working world]]. 

## Overcoming human suffering is about acceptance

So it seems like it all comes down to acceptance. From Buddhism to [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|Greek philosophers]] to Daoist Chinese philosophy of [[Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happen|Wu-Wei]], life seems to be about a deep sense of acceptance of reality. Great [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|resilience]] may be found in conforming our selves with the nature of the world rather than imposing our wills driven by a [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal sense of ego]].
## Four noble truths of Buddhism provide a framework for liberation from human suffering

These are the central tenets of Buddhism. Overcoming suffering in life comes from acceptance that it is part of the nature of the world. Such suffering can take form of physical or mental suffering. It's interesting that in [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]], a core tenet is that [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|suffering and difficulties can help give meaning to life]].
