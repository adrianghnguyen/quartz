When Brené Brown uses the phrase "[[Daring Greatly by Brené Brown|Daring Greatly]]" she is referring to the concept of embracing vulnerability and taking courageous steps in one's life. "Daring greatly" encapsulates the notion of stepping out of one's comfort zone, risking failure, and embracing vulnerability as a means to achieve [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]], [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|meaningful connections]], and success.
