Passive learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge without actively applying or practicing it. It can be a first step in surveying the land and getting situated when learning something new like in the [[Learn anything like Feynman|Feynman method]].

Passive learning can create knowledge, but it may not lead to skill development or progress towards goals. If we think about the pyramid of knowledge. we need to put it into practice to [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|process information deeply to create knowledge]]. That's why [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|doing the thing]] leads to [[Active practice leads to skill development|skill development]].

Within this learning method, we do not [[Continuous feedback leads to change|receive feedback]] which is not conducive to maximizing [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]].

Learning something new can sometimes be a way to avoid taking action and can become a form of procrastination or [[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism|simple escapism]] from confronting deeper thoughts. It makes us think that we are making progress but we're simply treading waters where we may experience failure. As a result, passive learning can feel safe since there are no opportunities to fail when you're "simply learning".

Passive learning can be valuable, but it should be complemented with active practice for meaningful progress.
