# Success is a long gritty road which requires time and delayed gratification.

[[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|Finding meaning in life provides happiness and should be our utmost priority.]]

Success is not a linear journey, but rather something which is peppered with valleys of doubts and failures as well as local minima of victories and successes. It will ebb and flow. 

There are times when we may [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|experience feeling stuck]]. Those are signals that [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|something is wrong]] and we need to take a [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.|pause to evaluate our options]] and possibly [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|redirect goals]].

## Personal reflections on definition of success

How should one define success? In our modern society, there are multiple ways, through the cultural values to [[Cultural roots of shame|what's being preached to us within media]].

There can be
- monetary gain
- social reputation aka status and fame
- personal improvement
- altruism (see also [[Elevating others also benefits us|selfish altruism]])
- learning
- personal happiness ([[The Happiness Equation]]?)

It's most likely dependent on one's [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|personal values. What is truly important to me?]] What do [[My core values define what matters|mine say about me]]? I'll need to take the [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|time to reflect about that]].

## Success is not a linear journey

Even Steve Jobs, a supposed genius had doubts at the beginning of his career. We may start doubting our competencies and our [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|sense of self]] - triggering lost [[Self-confidence|self-confidence]]. This self-doubt can make it hard for us to [[Dealing with failure and mistakes|cope with failure]].
