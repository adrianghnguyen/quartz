## Introspection has its limitations for career exploration

In the search for [[Career capital|rare and valuable skills]], it's nice to think about the process - but sometimes to get to [[Self-discovery is about trying new things|know more about oneself]], I need to simply try things out through [[Experiment by testing new ideas|the process of experimentation]].

> Research shows that it’s hard to work out what [[Rare and valuable skills|you’re going to be good at]] ahead of time. Career tests, trying to [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspect]], or just “going with your gut” seem like poor ways of figuring this out.

## Knowing yourself through introspection has its limits

Related to [[Purpose in life]]

You can seek to justify - but at some point, you lack the ability of digging deeper. Is it because we can only observe one's self up until one point. An eye cannot see itself. It must observe through reflection. Is this the role of [[Artificial intelligence|AI (artificial intelligence)]]? [[Learning from dragonflies|Dragonflies]] also have a blind spot despite having a great field of vision.

### Discovering what I like

I've always enjoyed reading about warfare…maybe because I want to know more about [[Think strategically|strategic thinking]]? Because I want to know how people deal with incomplete information…like in Starcraft? ([[My love letter to StarCraft]])?

- Finish algorithm book - see how it resonates
- Read book about artificial intelligence for dummies
- Finish reflecting on [[Discover your personal values through reflection|personal values]]…Write for 5 hours?
- Write out at least 20 activities/things [[Purpose in life]]s through personal ambition]] and make it into a coherent thought draft with highlighted thems
- Review graph view of Obsidian and look for the top 10 biggest nodes.
	- Writing them ought might give me a clue as to my biggest themes.
