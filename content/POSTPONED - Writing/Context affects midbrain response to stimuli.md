> There’s mounting evidence that in a variety of ways, in both rats and humans, context changes how the midbrain responds to stimuli. Human brain imaging studies have found that uncertainty and risk can influence [[Nucleus accumbens|NAc]] response (Abler et al., “Prediction Error”) and that the NAc’s of people with chronic back pain respond differently to “noxious thermal stimulation” (i.e., burning) compared with people who don’t live with pain (Baliki et al., “Predicting Value of Pain”).
>
> Something particularly interesting about the study of brain functioning in people with chronic back pain: When they directed their attention to the burning sensation on the skin of their back, they reported that the heat hurt; when they directed their attention to the pain in the muscles of their back, they reported that the heat felt good. Where we focus our attention is part of context.
>
> The NAc even appears to be important in placebo studies (Zubieta and Stohler, “Neurobiological Mechanisms of Placebo Responses; Tracey, “Getting the Pain You Expect”). Remember the placebo effect from chapter 2—about 40 percent of people taking a sugar pill that they are told will increase their interest in sex, do indeed experience more interest in sex.

> I expect that future research will find that the nucleus accumbens is involved in that effect.
