Related to [[Depression]]

This is one of the [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|scientific models]] to help us understand and conceptualize depression.

> Behavioral Shutdown Model (BSM), which suggests that depression may represent an evolved tendency to decrease behavioral expenditure in response to **chronic danger, [[_MOC Stress|stress]], or consistent failure** to achieve one’s [goals](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/motivation "Psychology Today looks at goals").
>
> The cost-to-benefit ratio suggests that organisms can maximize the ratio by increasing benefits or by **decreasing costs.**
>
> - **Increasing** benefits is associated with actively acquiring some resource (food, [sex](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/sex "Psychology Today looks at sex"), status) in the environment via behavioral investment. The individual’s state of actively working to increase benefit can be described as desire.
> - **Decreasing** behavioral investment can also be a way in which organisms deal with the cost-to-benefit ratio. There are many examples of behavioral shutdown mechanisms in nature, such as [[sleep]], hibernation, and exhaustion, that function to decrease behavioral expenditure and conserve energy.
>
> The model predicts that because depressed individuals are focused on avoiding further loss, they should perceive more negative and pessimistic outcomes. Depressed individuals should also be risk aversive and tend to avoid potentially threatening stimuli.

## Wilting as a survival strategy to conserve energy

When faced with [[Emotional and physical burnout|overwhelming stress]] such as excessive heat from the environment, poor soil condition, etc.  plants will begin wilting as a way to conserve their energy and protect the overall organism. Wilting can be considered as a survival strategy which focuses on conserving energy.^[It's probably covered more within the following resource: Hale, M. G., & Orcutt, D. M. (1987). The physiology of plants under stress. John Wiley & Sons..]

We can think of it as going '*goblin-mode*' and doing the bare minimum maintenance as a [[Coping mechanisms for stress|coping mechanism for stress]]. It's a method of [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|managing the organism's energy]].
