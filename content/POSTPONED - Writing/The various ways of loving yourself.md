- Gaining a better appreciation of your identity and who you are (that's just [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|being authentic]] isn't it?)
- Reconciliation of our inner truth and the ego
	- having nothing left to prove - requiring [[external validation]] which is shaped by our environments ([[Personality is shaped our environment]]) such as one's upbringing

True self esteem ([[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself]]) is thinking that we have enough competence to be able to deal with the unknown, even if it is enough outside of our current state ([[Fixed mindset]]). We have may have fear or reluctance which can manifest itself as insecurities. When dealing with others, we can even react poorly if our self-image is shaken ([[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego]]).

When putting this in self-determination theory's perspective ([[Humans are motivated to grow]]), we can now see why we are wired to seek mastery and expertise. When we acquire new competencies, we reinforce the belief that we are able to overcome difficult situations ([[View challenges as opportunities]]), especially if their roots are emotional([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]).

True authenticity is leaving our need to prove ourselves ([[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]]) and realize we are sufficient as we are. Perhaps that is the key to [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|true confidence]], (maybe reference [[Daring Greatly by Bren√© Brown]] or the [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited]]) to be in touch with our true selves. Considering the need for connections ([[The need to belong is the root of social connection]]), being able to showcase our inner selves to others  ([[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited]]) we form meaningful connections ([[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction]]).
