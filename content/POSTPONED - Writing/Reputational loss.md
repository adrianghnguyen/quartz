## The hermit king

> "The hermit king walls himself in against admitting a mistake or changing his mind because he fears that doing so will make him look stupid or incompetent."
>
> According to a [[REF How to Get Better at Admitting You're Wrong|study]], failing to admit we're wrong after tends to create a greater reputational loss than simply [[Apologizing sincerely requires action|admitting our mistake]].
>
> Be careful of your [[Limbic system regulates multiple systems|guttural]] emotional reaction, as we'll fight to the death to preserve our self-image for doomed ideas for fear of looking stupid or ignorant.
