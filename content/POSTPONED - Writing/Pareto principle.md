> The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is a concept stating that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. It was named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who observed in the early 20th century that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of its population. This principle has been applied to many fields, including business, economics, and personal productivity. It suggests that focusing on the most important factors can lead to significant improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.
