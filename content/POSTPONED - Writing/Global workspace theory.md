## What is global workspace theory?

Global Workspace Theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness developed by psychologist Bernard Baars in the 1980s. It seeks to explain the nature of conscious experience and the way information becomes globally available within the brain. The theory proposes that consciousness arises from the global availability of information, allowing different brain processes to access and share this information.

The Global Workspace Theory offers a plausible framework for understanding consciousness by emphasizing the role of information integration and sharing across the brain. It provides insights into the selective nature of conscious experience, the importance of attention, and the neural mechanisms that might underlie global information processing.

| The global workspace                            | At the core of the theory is the idea of a "global workspace" that integrates and broadcasts information across different brain regions. This workspace is a dynamic network of interconnected neurons, which allows for the sharing of information among various specialized systems, such as [[Perception aka Mood\|perception]], [[Memory is processed information|memory]], emotion, and decision-making.                                                                  |
| [[Working memory is limited\|Limited capacity]] | The global workspace has a limited capacity, meaning that only a small amount of information can be processed and shared at any given moment. This limited capacity is thought to give rise to the serial, focused nature of conscious experience, as opposed to the **parallel processing** that occurs in the unconscious mind.                                                                                                                      |
| Competition for access                          | Numerous cognitive processes are constantly competing for access to the global workspace. When a particular process becomes dominant, it gains access to the workspace and can share its information globally across the brain. This dominant process is experienced consciously, while other processes remain unconscious.                                                                                                                            |
| Consciousness as a global broadcast             | Once information is integrated into the global workspace, it is broadcasted to various cognitive systems, making it available for widespread processing. This "global broadcast" allows for the coordination of different mental processes and enables us to react and adapt to our environment based on the information we are consciously aware of.                                                                                                  |
| The role of attention                           | Attention plays a crucial role in determining which information is granted access to the global workspace. By directing our attention to specific sensory input or cognitive tasks, we can selectively control which information becomes conscious and globally available.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Neural correlates                               | The neural basis of the global workspace remains an area of active research. Some studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex, the parietal cortex, and the thalamus may be involved in the formation and maintenance of the global workspace. Additionally, neural synchrony, or the coordinated firing of neurons across different brain regions, has been implicated in the integration and broadcasting of information within the global workspace. |
