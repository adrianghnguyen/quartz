> System intelligence refers to the ability of a system, such as a computer or an AI, to understand and adapt to its environment in order to achieve specific goals. It involves using advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to gather information, make decisions, and take appropriate actions. System intelligence can be achieved through machine learning, deep learning, and other AI technologies. It enables systems to learn from experience, improve their performance over time, and handle complex tasks with minimal human intervention.

SI systems consist typically of a population of individuals interacting in a network with one another and with their environment. The inspiration often comes from nature, especially biological systems.

## Swarm intelligence

Swarm intelligence (SI) is the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems, natural or artificial. The concept is employed in work within the field of [[Artificial intelligence]]. The expression was introduced by Gerardo Beni and Jing Wang in 1989, in the context of cellular robotic systems.

Swarm intelligence has been applied to optimization problems such as routing in communications networks, vehicle routing, and video game strategy.

## Metaheuristics

> [!ai] AI
>
Metaheuristics are problem-solving techniques that use higher-level strategies to guide the search for solutions in complex optimization problems. These techniques are general-purpose and do not rely on specific problem structures, allowing them to address a wide range of problems across different domains. Metaheuristics typically involve iterative improvement processes that explore the search space by generating and evaluating candidate solutions based on a set of rules or heuristics. Examples of metaheuristics include simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, tabu search, and ant colony optimization.

## Collective intelligence

> [!ai] AI
> Collective intelligence can be a useful tool when it comes to organizing your life. This is because collective intelligence involves gathering knowledge, skills, and ideas from a group of people in order to solve problems and make decisions. By tapping into the collective intelligence of others, you can gain insights and perspectives that you may not have considered on your own.

> One way to access collective intelligence is through online communities and forums. There are many online communities dedicated to productivity, organization, and goal-setting where you can seek advice and support from others who are also trying to improve their lives. These communities often offer tips, resources, and accountability partners that can help you stay motivated and on track.
>
> Another way to access collective intelligence is through networking with people in your personal and professional circles. By [[Make more friends by expanding our network of friendships|connecting with others]] who have similar goals or interests, you can learn from their experiences, share best practices, and collaborate on projects that benefit everyone involved.
>
> Finally, consider seeking out a mentor or coach who can provide guidance and feedback as you work towards your goals. Mentors and coaches have often gone through similar experiences themselves and can offer valuable insights based on their own successes (and failures).
>
> In summary, by tapping into the collective intelligence of others through online communities, networking with peers, or seeking out mentorship/coaching opportunities, you can gain new perspectives, ideas, skills that will help you organize your life more effectively.

### Global brain

> [!quote] Global brain
>
> A group of people can be viewed as a single collective brain. Such brain has more knowledge that an individual one. New technologies such as Internet and brain-machine interfaces can in future allow to literally connect brains of different people to each other. When all neurons on the planet get connected to each other, the global brain will emerge. Human person will become immortal and will know everything.

Collective intelligence allows us to tap into [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|diverse sources of knowledge]]. Each various opinions and perspective of can be considered as a an individual neuron within a broader [[Neural Network|neural network]]. Together, if we could connect with everyone's collective consciousness, we would be able to access the global brain as a single collective brain.
