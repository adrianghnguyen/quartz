## The myth of love is a feeling

- [Love is a feeling](http://conscious-transitions.com/real-love-versus-infatuation/). If you're not feeling love, then you don't really love your partner.
- If you have to question whether or not you love your partner, you obviously don't love him/her and it's time to walk away.

## The myth that love should feel just right

- [You should "just know that it's right."](http://conscious-transitions.com/am-i-just-convincing-myself-that-i-love-him) If you don't have that feeling of rightness, then it's clearly not right.
- You should feel head over heels "in love", which means butterflies and fireworks.
- Your partner should make you feel alive, whole, and fulfilled.

> [!quote] Pierce Brosnan's love for his wife
> Keely is the backbone of our family, of my life, and I tell her that I love her every day. Friends offered her surgery to reduce her weight. But I strongly love every curve of her body. She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our five children. In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I’m loving her even more that she is my children’s mother. And I am very proud of her, and **I always seek to be worthy of her love.**
