not a very happy person     1            2            3            4            5            6            7     a very happy person

2.  **Compared with most of my peers, I consider myself:**
less happy    1            2            3            4            5            6            7    more happy

3.  **Some people are generally very happy.  They enjoy life regardless of what is going on, getting the most out of everything.  To what extent does this characterization describe you?**
not at all    1            2            3            4            5            6            7    a great deal

4.  **Some people are generally not very happy.  Although they are not depressed, they never seem as happy as they might be.  To what extent does this characterization describe you?**
not at  all   1            2            3            4            5            6            7    a great deal

## How to interpret the score on the general happiness scale

> The Subjective/General Happiness scale lies on a range from 1.0 to 7.0, with higher scores reflecting greater happiness.
>
> According to one researcher, “The average score ranges from 4.5 and 5.5. It was observed that the average score of students tends to be below five, while working adults have an average score of 5.6. To interpret your score, consider which group you belong to. If you are a working adult and your score is higher than a 5.6, you can consider yourself happier than most people.”
>
> A score lower than 4 is considered low and it has been recommended that you may want to seek professional help or find interventions if your score is lower than a 4.
