## What is integration as a biological process?

When our internal states such as **physical comfort, hunger, thirst, [[Sleep is important|sleepiness]], loneliness, frustration**, et cetera, interact with our [[Mesolimbic pathway is the emotional center of the brain|emotional One Ring]]. Each of these internal states influence one another, which is the process of integration. This is also similar to the process of [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organization]] within [[Dynamic systems theory|dynamic systems theory]].

There are two main types:
1. Subtractive integration - when one states impairs  with another another
2. Additive integration - when one state reinforces another

An example of subtractive integration that would be cold feet affecting [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|sexual arousal]]. We could imagine many more interactions based on previous listed.

## Integrative processes can be good or bad for dynamics

In the context of romantic relationships, [[We love through attachment behaviors|proximity seeking]] from attachment mechanisms mixed with sexual motivation such as being told we're deeply loved can intensify experiences. It can be a double edged sword, though. For example, having expectations of orgasm while being stressed would lead one to have subtractive integration.

Likewise, women who have intense sex with their partners after being physically abused or experiencing additive integration. Threats to their attachment made them bond with their partner.^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]. Sex is a crucial attachment behavior for human adults. It was a mix of separation anxiety and sexual stimulation, which reinforced each other to give a sexual experience that is intense, but not safe and not healthy.
