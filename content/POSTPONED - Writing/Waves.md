# Wave equations

#status/postponed

Wave equations can be represented by [[Functions]]

## Sound waves

Started researching this because of asking questions about kpop songs to [[Justin Li]]. They began explaining to me the physical properties of singing and how we produce sound waves within our throats ([[Mechanics of singing]]).

> [!NOTE] FUUUUUU we're getting into math. Everything can be described with math - the universal truth language

Main properties of sound waves

### Wavelength

### Period

### Amplitude

### Frequency

### Velocity
