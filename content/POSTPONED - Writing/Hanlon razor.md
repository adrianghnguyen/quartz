> Hanlon's razor is a heuristic principle that states: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." This means that when something goes wrong or someone does something harmful, it is often more reasonable to assume that they made a mistake or acted without intent rather than assuming they did it intentionally. It encourages giving people the [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|benefit of the doubt]] and not [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|jumping to negative conclusions]] without sufficient evidence.

It can be common for us to damage our relationships by believing that others are intentionally trying to harm us or cause problems for us. Most of the time, situations are a result of inability or accidental mistakes or simply missing.

In addition to this idea is the fact that [[Outcomes derive from a complex system of interactions|System outcomes are explained by moderately rational individuals following incentives in a complex system of interactions]]

> - Hanlon's Razor is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] that suggests attributing negligence or incompetence rather than malice when trying to explain someone's actions.
> - It helps us develop better relationships, become less judgmental, and improve rationality.
> - The origin of Hanlon's Razor can be traced back to quotes from Napoleon Bonaparte and Goethe, and it has been voiced by others throughout history.
> - Hanlon's Razor works well when combined with other mental models, such as the availability heuristic, [[confirmation bias]], and bias from disliking/hating.
> - It is useful in various aspects of life, including media analysis, communication, and relationships.
> - However, Hanlon's Razor has limitations and may not apply in cases where malicious intent is evident.
> - It is important to consider logic, experience, and empirical evidence when applying Hanlon's Razor.
