Related to [[Attention restoration theory]]

According to the [[Attention restoration theory|ART theory]], humans have four possible states of attention:
1. Directed attention
2. Directed attention fatigue
3. Effortless attention.
4. Restore attention.

I wonder if effortless attention is referred to as [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow state]]?

## Voluntary or directed attention

Voluntary attention or direct attention is where attention is directed by cognitive control processes.

### Cognitive control

> Cognitive control is the process by which goals or plans influence behaviour. Also called executive control, this process can inhibit automatic responses and influence working memory. Cognitive control supports flexible, adaptive responses and complex goal-directed thought. Some disorders, such as schizophrenia and ADHD, are associated with impairments of executive function.

## Involuntary attention

# Mental fatigue is the depletion of directed attention

According to this theory, humans are constantly scanning for new information and processing environmental stimuli, like the Gundam metaphor from the [[Mind-body connection|mind-body connection]].

Since we are constantly processing information, we need to focus our attention on limiting how much we take in. This is called directed attention. And the effectiveness of this attention will diminish over time with constant use/depleted.

## Goal directed attention has a high mental cost

Goal directed attention to affected the most by mental fatigue, while stimulus driven attention is minimally affected by mental fatigue. Would this imply why [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|mindfulness is training]] us to develop further goal directed attention stamina?

When our attention is depleted, we become more [[Distractions and difficulty concentrating|easily distracted]] and less [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|mentally flexible]]. As a result, we might miss noticing important stimuli.

> Mental fatigue is also part ofÂ [occupational burnout](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout "Occupational burnout"), where cognitively, we distance ourselves or check out from our work because goal-directed attention capacity has decreased.
