## Segment Anything - an ML rotoscoping tool

[[Stuart Alldritt|Stuart Alldritt]] showed me an interesting [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] tool developed by Meta/Facebook called Segment Anything (SAM) which can be found as a repo here: [SAM Repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) which can rotoscope/segment out images. I can imagine how useful this will be for developing mixed reality as well as a virtual reality.
