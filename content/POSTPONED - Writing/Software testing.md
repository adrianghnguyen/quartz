# Testing code and software

#status/postponed 

We first began with the waterfall development [[Software development lifecycle|Software development lifecycle]]. However, by placing the testing at the end, it left teams unable to respond to failures which occurred due to omissions and missing particular scopes of work. 

Software testing is not only about ensuring that things work as expected - but that you are answering and delivering a solution which solves the issues which you are trying to solve.

It can be a big challenge for software engineers in test, SDETs^[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-development-engineer-in-test-sdet/] to write proper test cases while continuing their development work. This cultural shift aims to empower business users to work in parallel to define in natural language what needs to happen within the software.

Then came the following paradigms^[ [Behavior-Driven Development - Semaphore](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/behavior-driven-development)]:
1. Test-first programming
	- It focuses on writing in mutual feedback cycles testing and coding going back and forth between these two stages
2. [[test-driven development|Test-driven development]]
	- which focuses on a continuous cycle of design-test-coding which helps teams solve in evolving fashion and refactoring to incorporate features
3. [[Behavior-driven development (BDD)|Behavior-driven development (BDD)]]

It can often be difficult to dive cultural change in an organization to accept new ways of workings, and [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|new ways of thinking and operating]]. A redditor recommended these two books which tackle this problem:
