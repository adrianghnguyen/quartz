> External sources of emotional validation refer to seeking validation or approval from sources outside of oneself.

People with low self-esteem often rely heavily on external validation to feel confident and validated. However, this dependence on others' opinions can be detrimental as it can lead to a constant need for external validation and a lack of self-acceptance and self-love. Developing internal sources of validation is crucial for building healthier self-esteem.

In other words, they have a [[My core values define what matters|strong identity based on chosen values]] rather than values they believe due to the demands or [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|expectations]] of others. This type of identity is usually considered an "[[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|achieved identity]]" in which a person has analyzed their beliefs and values to decide the set of internal principles or values that they will adhere to.
