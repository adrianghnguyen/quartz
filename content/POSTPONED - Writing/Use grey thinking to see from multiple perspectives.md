> Grey thinking refers to the ability to see and understand multiple perspectives or viewpoints on a given topic or issue. It involves being open-minded, flexible, and willing to consider different opinions and ideas. Grey thinkers are not easily swayed by emotions or personal biases, but instead rely on critical thinking and rationality to make decisions. They seek out information from various sources and weigh the pros and cons before forming an opinion. Grey thinking is essential for effective problem-solving, conflict resolution, and decision-making in a complex and diverse world.

Gray thinking is the ability to see and understand multiple perspectives or viewpoints on a given topic or issue. Farnam Street, one of [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|my trusted information sources]] helps explain the value in adopting grey thinking since the world is so complicated and we are prey to [[confirmation bias]].

We often make snap judgments driven by [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking]], being prone to [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive biases]] such as [[Black or white-thinking|black or white thinking]]. It requires significant [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|cognitive flexibility]] and the [[Ambiguity tolerance is the ability to handle uncertainty|ability to tolerate ambiguity]].

I think adopting gray thinking is a key facet of [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|an educated mind]] but can be difficult to achieve since it requires [[Build a latticework of mental models to develop grey thinking|building a latticework of mental models]].

## The danger of looking through the world through a psychological lens

As for myself I was educated in psychology. I need to be careful about my pitfalls through examining world from this lens. I think it's important to understand my own personal bias to how I approach information.

A blind spot may be over analyzing behaviors, overlooking non psychological influences, forgetting to take into account cultural differences, individual differences, and obsessing over analytical thinking may hinder my ability to develop genuine connection with others.

I've been told a few times that people don't necessarily want to be analyzed but simply understood. I should [[Listen with empathy during conversations|seek to understand others]].

Sometimes, I fall into the role of psychologist  rather than a [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|genuine friend]] or to be consciously scrutinizing their behavior. I'll try to [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|be better as a person]] and learn from this particular feedback.

## The essence of thinking in gray is to hold conflicting opposing thoughts in mind

> The essence of thinking gray is this: don't form an opinion about an important matter until you've head all the relevant facts and arguments, or until circumstances force you to form an opinion without recourse to all the facts (which happens occasionally, but much less frequently than one might imagine).

> F. Scott Fitzgerald once described something similar to thinking gray when he observed that the test of a [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|first-rate mind]] is the *ability to hold two opposing thoughts at the same time while still retaining the ability to function*.^[Steven Sample from The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership]
