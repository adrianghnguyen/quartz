Self-confidence, relates to a person's belief in their own abilities to accomplish specific tasks or goals as opposed to [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]]. That if one one puts their mind to it, they have the ability to do the things they want to do.

It is more situational and can vary from one area of life to another. For example, an individual may have [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-confidence]] in their athletic abilities but lack confidence in their public speaking skills. Self-confidence can be influenced by past experiences, skills, knowledge, and feedback from others.

By fostering self-confidence, we enhance our ability to [[Create effective goals|set and achieve goals]], present ourselves more positively to others, and maintain positive mental well-being. By [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|exuding confidence with the as if principle]], people perceive us as competent, [[Warm and close relationships are dependable|reliable]], and trustworthy. Greater [[Find your niche|opportunities]] for personal and professional growth can arise from this perception of others.

The good news is that self-confidence can be [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|developed through practice]] and [[History is a good teacher|learning our from past experiences]]. [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|Surrounding ourselves with supportive individuals]] also contributes to building self-confidence as they make us [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|feel less lonely]] in our times of adversities and failures. Self-confidence can be developed as a skill.

I think a part of [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|true confidence]] in knowing who are we and pursuing it [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|authentically]] - without feeling held back. Is that the secret to [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-confidence]]? 

According to James Clear, the difference between successful people and unsuccessful people is not intelligence, nor opportunity or resources. It's the belief that they can make their goals happen, markers of [[Self-confidence|confidence in their capabilities]]. It's about [[Take calculated risks like an entrepreneur|taking calculated risks to create opportunities]].

## Believing in yourself improves our mental health

Recognizing our strengths, setting realistic goals, and celebrating achievements are essential in this process. [[Fixed mindset|Continuous challenges and growth opportunities]] further enhance self-confidence. It also bears great positive impact on our mental well-being by helping us [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|manage stress]], [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|anxiety]] and shake off [[Cognitive distortions|negative thought patterns]] by providing us with a sense of [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal agency]] over our lives.

Self-confidence allows us to approach the various challenges such as [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transitions]] with a [[Learned optimism is a skill|positive mindset]] and increases our [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional resilience]].

## Self-confidence leads to goal perseverance

Having self-confidence allows us to believe in ourselves even when [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|faced with adversity]] or setbacks. It provides the motivation and determination needed to persevere through difficult times and keep on pushing with [[Take calculated risks like an entrepreneur|calculated risks to create opportunities]]. I guess it's part of developing a mindset of [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|stoic acceptance]].

When we have confidence in our abilities, we are more likely to take on new challenges and step out of our comfort zones. It's something that's explored by researchers in terms of the [[Self-protection and anxiety avoidance|retreating into a cocoon]] and closing ourselves off to new experiences. We wish to conserve the status quo rather than expand upon possibilities.  It takes [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit to find long-term success]].

But we can learn to [[Building resilience to rejection|Build rejection resilience through practice]]. So it's okay to fail. It will happen time and time again. And it will feel less devastating over time. [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|Obsessing with failure is not very productive.]]

## Personal reflections on self-confidence

If I had to think about it in a certain way, it's believing that our personal skills have inherent worth, which is distinct from [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] but tangentially related. A good way to think about is that that 'I am a prize worth catching' in regards to a skillset.

I am writing this [[2023-10-19|today]] because I feel a bit down after a rejection from %% [[Interview with Candid Co|Candid Co]] %% this company and it shatters a bit of my self-worth. Could I have done things a bit better? Should I have been more? It engenders [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|feelings of shame]].

### Questioning the self

At times, the question of what is my identity arises in times of [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] where [[Self-confidence|self-doubt]] exists. Perhaps a better way of thinking about my identity is to trace it to my behaviours - and to my opinions of the world. How do I react in certain situations? What do I think about a certain topic? Clinging onto the self seems like a path of suffering stemming from [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|personal attachment]]. A [[Lack of self-confidence creates personal doubt and fear|lack of self-confidence]] leads me to question my [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]].
