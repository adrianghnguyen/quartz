> [!ai] AI
> The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is the network of nerves that connects the central nervous system (CNS) to the rest of the body. It includes all nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, including sensory and motor nerves.

> The PNS is divided into two main components: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system controls voluntary movements and sensations, such as touching a hot stove or walking. The autonomic nervous system regulates involuntary functions, such as heart rate, digestion, and breathing.
>
> The PNS is responsible for relaying information from sensory receptors to the CNS and transmitting motor signals from the CNS to muscles and glands. It plays a crucial role in allowing us to interact with our environment by sensing changes in temperature, pressure, and other stimuli, as well as initiating movement and reacting to potential threats.
>
> Damage or dysfunction of the PNS can result in a variety of conditions, including neuropathy, which affects sensations in the limbs, and autonomic disorders that affect heart rate or digestion. Treatment options for these conditions may include medications, physical therapy, or surgery.
