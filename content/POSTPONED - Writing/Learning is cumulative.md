> Learning is a process that is ongoing and cumulative. It refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, and understanding through various experiences and exposure to different sources of information. The process of learning starts from the moment we are born and continues for the rest of our lives.
>
> As we learn new things, we build upon what we already know. Each new piece of knowledge or skill that we acquire becomes a part of our existing mental [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]], enhancing our understanding of the world around us. This means that learning is often described as being cumulative, with each new experience adding to our overall knowledge base.
>
> The main benefit of cumulative learning is that it enables us to develop a deeper understanding of complex concepts over time. By gradually building up our knowledge through multiple experiences and exposures, we can develop a more nuanced perspective on topics that might have initially seemed confusing or difficult.
> In addition to fostering deeper understanding, cumulative learning also allows us to make connections between different areas of knowledge. By recognizing patterns and relationships between different concepts, we can better understand how they relate to one another and apply this knowledge in new situations.
>
> In conclusion, learning should be seen as a [[Continuous process and cycles|continuous process]] that builds upon existing knowledge. By embracing the idea that learning is cumulative, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of the world around us and become more effective learners in all aspects of our lives.
