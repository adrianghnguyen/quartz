Learning programming can be intimidating at times - it takes a lot of time, effort and commitment to bcome good at it. No one is born being a good programmer and only experience helps us grow. Despite that, having [[Imposter syndrome|imposter syndrome]] can be quite difficult in this [[Career tracks define long-term advancement paths|career path]].

Lessons to take away:
- It takes time to build skills
- Beginner projects will be shitty - that's part of the process. It's about the [[Show up and at least try your best|habit of showing up]].
- Programming is a big world and even in there, you will have particular niches.
- Look for mentors or people willing to be supportive in your career growth
- It's a continuous process of learning programming so I shouldn't feel too discouraged if there's more to learn out there. Approach learning with enthusiasm.
- It takes time to be proficient - be patient.

> - You don't have to be good at everything: Stuart acknowledged that web design was not his forte but focused on his interests and strengths.
> - The importance of finding a mentor/supportive members: The lead architect at Meta sat down with Stuart and helped him understand the complex aspects of their project.
> - Everyone starts somewhere: Despite his achievements, Stuart described himself as a "dumbass firmware engineer" at one point. Remember that everyone, even accomplished professionals, have moments of self-doubt or feeling out of their depth.
> - Real-world experience can be just as valuable as formal education: Stuart’s time in co-op jobs and working on practical projects were instrumental to his skill development.

### Programming isn't a natural human ability - even the gifted may struggle

I think it's easy for people who always did well in school, which was someone like me, encountering true difficulty for the first time. Because it's such a familiar experience, you may want to give up, or it might feel incredibly difficult because it's a challenge to my ego.

> In school, did you find most subjects easy to pick up and easily pass the tests? We're you considered to be in some sort of "gifted" program during school+
> 
> I just ask because this type of mentality I've found is common amongst "gifted" individuals that were constantly given reenforcement that everything just comes easy to them during school. They get the idea that it will always be like that… Then suddenly it's not like that and since they've never really had to work hard for knowledge, or skills running across something that challenges them it's shell shocking.
> 
> Regardless of any of the above, some people will pick up stuff much more quickly than others. Don't compare yourself to them, just work hard and study and understand things in your own way. Ask specific questions. Asking "how it all works" will get you an answer like the following.
> 
> Programming works by taking the lines of code you write and turning them into electrical impulses which pass through special rocks used to determine which actions need to be taken given the electrical pulses it's getting.
> 
> My suggestion, bite the bullet and work hard. If you really want to learn to code, this will not be your last road block. Learning to continue forward and work past those types of blockers is probably even more important to programming than the actual programming.
