> Attentional bias refers to the tendency of our attention to be drawn towards certain stimuli in our environment, while ignoring others. It is influenced by our previous experiences, beliefs, and emotional states.

> Attentional bias can affect both focus and distractions in the following ways:
> 1. Focus: Attentional bias can enhance our focus on specific stimuli that are relevant or important to us. For example, if someone has a fear of spiders, they may have an attentional bias towards spider-related stimuli. This bias can result in heightened attention and focus on spiders, making it difficult to concentrate on other things.
> 2. Distractions: Attentional bias can also lead to increased susceptibility to distractions. If we have a bias towards certain stimuli, we may find it challenging to ignore them even when they are irrelevant or unwanted. For instance, individuals with an [[Social media epidemic contributes to the mental health crisis|attentional bias towards social media]] may struggle to stay focused on their work or studies when notifications pop up.
