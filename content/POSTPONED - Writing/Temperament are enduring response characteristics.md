# Temperament are enduring response characteristics

> Temperament refers to an individual's natural and enduring psychological and emotional characteristics. It encompasses a broader set of innate traits that influence how a person reacts to various situations and interacts with the world.

Temperament tends to cover a more general spectrum, and it affects how our emotional responses occur, our sociability, energy levels, and adaptability. It's something that's relatively stable over time, and it's believed that it has a strong biological or genetic basis, and it's less likely to change in response to external influences (in contrast to [[Inclination are personal preferences|personal inclinations]].

Constructs which apply are:
1. Emotional responses
2. Sociability
3. Activity level
4. Adaptability

One of the big ways of conceptualizing it is the Big Five/OCEAN test. For example, I scored pretty highly on [[Neuroticism|neuroticism]] and is something I need to accept about myself.
