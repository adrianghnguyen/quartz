# Deep learning

Deep learning is **a [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans**: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost.

_Deep learning_ is part of a broader family of _machine learning_ methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.

Relationship on a psychology level to [[Process information deeply to create knowledge]]?

Came across this while researching adversarial treatment - interesting.

Keyword of stochastic descent gradient - oh fuck we're going into math now.
