> Some misunderstandings and disagreements are unresolvable, and that’s OK. As I noted when I began, generosity goes a long way. If one person is generous and the other is incalcitrant, a resolution may not be possible. Attempting to force one in such situations may do more damage. In such situations, it’s perfectly reasonable to respectfully disengage from the conversation and try another day.

## Personal reflection

[[2023-08-30]] I had an appointment with [[Marleen MacDonald|Marleen MacDonald]] and it was a quick check-in to see how family therapy is going with my mom.

We talked about how I'm learning to [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|practice acceptance of the situation and to let go of certain expectations]], additionally how the ability to [[Honest communication is clear|be direct and communicate my needs with clear intent]] is very positive.

The other thing to notice is that giving my mom the opportunity to breathe and develop self-autonomy actually increases her likeliness to reach out and [[Create trust in order to build an emotional connection|build emotional connection through restoring trust]] after feelings of broken promises. And what's important to recognize is that I don't need to do the emotional labor of the relationship. That's why we have a family therapist and so I can learn to let go of that.

She also mentioned the fact that when I ask my mom about things about childhood, the past from [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]], and my mom says, I don't know and I don't remember much, it maybe comes from a place of her subconsciously thinking, this is a really difficult place for me to explore and so I'm not comfortable talking about it. I guess that's a good reminder to me that [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|Emotional vulnerability requires an invitation]].
