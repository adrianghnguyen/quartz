> Positive reinforcement refers to a behavioral technique in which desirable behaviors are rewarded or reinforced, increasing the likelihood of those behaviors being repeated in the future. It involves providing a positive consequence, such as praise, rewards, or privileges, immediately after a desired behavior is performed. The goal of positive reinforcement is to encourage and strengthen desired behaviors, while discouraging or eliminating undesired behaviors. This technique is widely used in various settings, including education, parenting, and workplace, to promote learning, motivation, and positive behavior change.
