# Zone 2 training for endurance

#status/postponed

This is useful for [[What is aerobic vs anaerobic training|aerobic training]] which is about improving our overall endurance - of which cycling as a fitness activity is part of.

## Building a base endurance engine through zone 2 training

> Oversimplification incoming.

> Ride z2 as much as possible. Ride above z2 no more than 2x a week, no more than 2 hours a week total.

> Why does Z2 improve FTP? Think of your body as a Formula 1 hybrid car. You got the big gas engine and a tiny electic motor for bursts. Your 'aerobic' system is the big gas engine - it lasts a long time, it consumes mostly fats and oxygen for power, and it's super super trainable by just doing tons of z2. Your 'electric motor' is your 'anaerobic' engine - it burns carbs for fuel, it's great for bursts, but it doesn't last long. It's also very easy to train this in a matter of a few short weeks.

> So you train tons of z2 to build your gasoline engine as big as possible. Then you do a little bit of intensity to 'top off' your electric motor, and voila.

> For example, after a paternity break my z2 went from around 130w in January to around 215W today, whereas my 'electic motor' has consistently added maybe around 100W to my FTP.
