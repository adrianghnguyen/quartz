A ranking of yearnings is also driven by our ranking of fears coming from our yearning octopus. Each side of our yearning is driven by the fear of the opposite. This has a deep impact on our [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]] and it may require a visit to the [[The garden of shame metaphor|garden of shame]] to understand how they may have developed. For example, if we wish to be admired, perhaps we have an innate fear of embarrassment. If we have a deep yearning for self-esteem, perhaps we live a [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|deep sense of shame]].

From there, we should decide to classify them.
