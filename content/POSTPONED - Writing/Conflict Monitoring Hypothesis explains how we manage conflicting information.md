# Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis explains how we manage conflicting information

#status/postponed

---

The [[The brain manages incongruent information by engaging in conflict monitoring|conflict monitoring]] hypothesis is a psychological [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] which explains how we detect and manage conflicting thoughts or information. It seeks to understand how cognitive control occurs in such scenarios.

> The primary psychological model that explains conflict monitoring is the **Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis**. This hypothesis is part of the broader framework of cognitive control and is often associated with the role of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in detecting and managing conflicts.
>
> **Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis**: Proposed by Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, and Cohen in 2001, this hypothesis suggests that the ACC acts as a conflict detector. According to this model, when the brain encounters conflicting or competing information, the ACC detects the presence of conflict and signals the need for increased cognitive control. This cognitive control involves allocating more attention, focusing more effort, and adapting cognitive processes to resolve the conflict.

> The Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis explains how the brain responds when there is a discrepancy between competing responses, such as when making decisions or inhibiting an automatic response. The ACC's role as a conflict detector helps individuals adjust their cognitive processes to optimize performance and decision-making in the presence of conflicting information.

## Conflict monitoring process

> Certainly, here's a more detailed explanation of the conflict monitoring process as described by the Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis:
>
> 1. **Detection of Conflict**: When the brain encounters a situation where there is a conflict between different responses or information, such as choosing between multiple options or inhibiting an automatic response, the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) becomes activated. The ACC serves as a conflict detector and assesses the level of conflict present in the situation.
>
> 2. **Conflict Signal**: The ACC generates a "conflict signal" when it detects a conflict between competing information or responses. This signal indicates to other brain regions that there is a need to allocate more [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive resources]] and attention to the task at hand. The conflict signal acts as an alert system, highlighting the presence of a challenge that requires resolution.
>
> 3. **Engagement of Cognitive Control**: Upon receiving the conflict signal from the ACC, the brain's cognitive control mechanisms are engaged. These mechanisms involve adjusting cognitive processes to address the conflict and make optimal decisions. Cognitive control includes processes such as attentional allocation, working memory, and inhibitory control.
>
> 4. **Increased Attention and Effort**: In response to the conflict signal, the brain directs more attention and effort toward processing the conflicting information. This heightened attention helps individuals focus on the relevant aspects of the task and reduces the interference caused by the conflicting information.
>
> 5. **Resolution of Conflict**: The heightened cognitive control and attention facilitate the resolution of the conflict. This can involve various cognitive processes, such as evaluating the pros and cons of different options, inhibiting automatic or impulsive responses, and making deliberate and [[Make informed decisions|informed decisions]].
>
> 6. **Adaptive Adjustments**: As the conflict is resolved, the brain may update its cognitive processes and strategies based on the outcome. If a particular response or strategy led to a successful resolution of the conflict, the brain may store this information for future reference, aiding in more efficient conflict resolution in similar situations.
>
> The Conflict Monitoring Hypothesis underscores the importance of the ACC in detecting conflicts, initiating cognitive control processes, and optimizing decision-making and performance in situations where there is competing or incompatible information. This process is a key aspect of cognitive flexibility and adaptability, allowing individuals to navigate complex and challenging tasks effectively.
