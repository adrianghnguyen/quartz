# Celebrate small wins in order to develop a sense of accomplishment

It's easy to slip into [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|shifting expectations]] as soon as we achieve something big - or new. Don't forget that [[Happiness is a homeostatic process|happiness is a homeostatic process]] so it's important to [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|stay in the present]] and [[Non-zero day mindset|be grateful to the 3 you's]]. Celebrating small victories helps engage the [[Brain reward or enjoyment system releases dopamine|brain's reward system]] which will help me further cement the habit.
 Building new habits is not easy, and it's something worth celebrating as mentioned in the [[Use the RIC framework to commit to behavioural change|RIC framework for behaviour change]].

> Celebrating small wins is an important practice that can help boost motivation, build confidence, and maintain a positive mindset. Here are a few ways to celebrate small wins:
> 1. Acknowledge and appreciate the accomplishment: Take a moment to recognize the effort and progress you have made. Give yourself credit for the small steps you have taken towards your goal.
> 2. Reward yourself: Treat yourself to something special as a way of celebrating your achievement. It could be as simple as enjoying your favorite dessert or taking some time for self-care activities.
> 3. Share your success: Share your small win with someone close to you, such as a friend or family member. Celebrating with others can enhance the joy and make it more memorable.
> 4. Reflect on the journey: Take some time to reflect on the process that led to your small win. Consider the challenges you overcame, lessons learned, and how you can apply them to future endeavors.
> 5. Set new goals: After celebrating a small win, it's important to continue setting new goals or milestones. This helps maintain momentum and ensures continued progress towards larger objectives.
> Remember, celebrating small wins is not about being complacent but rather about recognizing the value of each step in the journey towards success.

Part of having [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-esteem]] is learning to appreciate the good work I do and [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|taking ownership]] of my positive accomplishments - that's how I can learn to to develop [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]] and increase a sense of accomplishment. I guess like anything else, building this habit is like a muscle and over time, I can learn to internalize this sense of accomplishment rather than listening to the [[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention|voice of the inner critic]].

I deserve to [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|be proud of myself]] and everything I've done. I am a competent person - I just need to remember everything I've achieved - [[My personal accomplishments and victories|my personal achievements and victories]]. Likewise, it's critical when I face a [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|perceived setback]], to acknowledge the work in myself in getting the ball moving again. I think it's how I can help increase my [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]].

Is there a link here to [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]]?
## Encourage others by summarizing and celebrating their efforts and grit

When dealing with people who are struggling in difficult times, such as children, we should use words of compassion rather than being critical of them or taking a judgemental attitude.

In this scenario, the child was stuck over a fence and was frustrated/would give up before climbing back out. Although the parent was there for the child, I feel like there could have been a better method of approaching the child rather than coming from a place of judgement.

> Yes, the kid really needed some encouragement, at the very least once he successfully climbed back over. Instead of the snarky "Was that so hard?" Dad should have said "Good job!" and explained how important it is to keep trying, even when things get hard/frustrating. This could have been a good lesson in perseverance, but I think Dad muddled that learning moment a bit by mildly shaming the kid instead.

The child was frustrated at the challenge and would be on the cusp of climbing back out. A little support and encouragement to [[Self-confidence|build his self-confidence]] would be to treat his frustration through validation of his feelings and positive support. Children are not fully developed adults - we should seek to remember that. Instead, we can do [[Emotion coaching is accepting all feelings and working through them|emotion coaching]] and understand how to [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotionally regulate]].

We should praise the effort and grit of people through [[Positive reinforcement encourages and reinforces desirable behaviours|positive reinforcement]].

From there, a little positive encouragement and [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|empathy]] would help them understand the importance of perseverance in difficult times.
