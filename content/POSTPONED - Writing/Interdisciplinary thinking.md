Interdisciplinary thinking refers to the ability to integrate knowledge and approaches from multiple disciplines to solve complex problems or explore new ideas. It involves breaking down the traditional boundaries between academic and professional disciplines and encourages collaboration and exchange between experts from different fields.

The value of combining knowledge from diverse domains lies in the potential for generating fresh insights and innovative solutions that may not have been possible within a single discipline. By drawing on different perspectives, interdisciplinary thinking promotes creativity, critical thinking, and the synthesis of ideas that can lead to breakthrough discoveries and advancements. It also helps address complex, real-world challenges that often require a multidimensional approach. Overall, interdisciplinary thinking encourages the exploration of connections and intersections between different domains to foster rich and nuanced understanding.
