Discovering [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|my personal identity]] may be a lifelong journey and it's normal for it to be constantly shifting. I shouldn't try to fixate too much - the me of today is not necessarily the [[Many lifetimes to live|me of tomorrow]].

- What do I like in terms of [[Things I find interesting|personal interests]]?
- What do I want [[My ideal life|my ideal life]] to look like?
- What is the [[Career fit is about finding the right career|right career for me]]?

It'll require constant experimentation and constant revisions but that's part of the fun in life - the [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|joy of experimentation]]. Knowing ourselves is a [[Knowing yourself is a rollercoaster of ups and downs|rollercoaster of confidence]].

## Why experimentation helps us understand more about ourselves

> The best way to [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|learn about ourselves]] is to [[Experiment by testing new ideas|test out ideas and learn from our experience]].

[[Curiosity is a basic motivation|Trying out new things]] allows us to enter more [[Feedback loop|positive feedback loops]] when we [[Experiment by testing new ideas|try out new things]] and helps present us with better options when making important career decisions such as [[Career fit is about finding the right career|finding the right career fit]]. Often times, finding our [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]] will be a [[Understanding the complexity of life|lifelong journey]]. [[Introspection has its limitations|Introspection has its limits]] and it's important to go out there to really figure things out. It'll provide information and feedback from which we can [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|operate]].

According to London Business School Professor Herminia Ibarra, one of the best ways to create new identities for ourselves is to [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|test and learn]] rather than plan then implement^[(Range, 163)]. It's having a [[Make quick and decisive actions|bias for action]] and taking [[Take calculated risks like an entrepreneur|entrepreneurial risks]] to [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|discover new things]] about ourselves and integrate it within our [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|ourselves]]. "Research suggests that we fail to experiment with new roles and ideas because we get stuck in a task-driven mindset where the goal is performance." - explained by [[Every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure|goodhart's law]].

> During my **Year of Many Errors** I received a good piece of advice: *“Try things until something comes easily.”* I took the advice to heart and tried four or five different business ideas over the next 18 months. I'd give each one a shot for two or three months, mix in a little bit of freelance work so I could continue scraping by and paying the bills, and repeat the process.

> Eventually, I found “something that came easily” and I was able to focus on building one business rather than trying to find an idea. In other words, I was able to simplify. This was the first thing I discovered about figuring out what to focus on. If you want to master and deeply understand the core fundamentals of a task you may, paradoxically, need to start by casting a very wide net. By trying many different things, you can get a sense of what comes more easily to you and set yourself up for success. It is much easier to focus on something that's working than struggle along with a bad idea.
