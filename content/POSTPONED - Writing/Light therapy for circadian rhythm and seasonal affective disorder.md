## Light therapy for circadian rhythm and seasonal affective disorder

I have a GoLite P1 from Apollo that was given to me by my mom. It produces blue-light and can help with SAD (seasonal affective disorder), depression and help regulate sleep patterns which is useful for maintaining a [[Maintain sleep hygiene|good sleep hygiene]].

- Use 15-30 mins per day
- Start at 50% and increase intensity if no effect was noticed
- Avoid using it within two hours of bedtime to prevent sleep disruption
- Scenarios
	- Difficulty getting up early -> Use in the morning
	- Falling asleep too early -> Use in the evening
	- No noticeable sleeping pattern shift -> Use in the morning + evening (keep away further at night)
