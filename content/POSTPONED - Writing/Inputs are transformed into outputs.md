# Production process theory

#status/postponed

## How are things made anyways?

> [!NOTE] Rework title - I think we can find something more meaningful to us

We need to exchange resources such as time, energy, money in order to get desired outputs. However, the intermediary step is conversion which we can also call the transformation process.

In psychology, the transformation process would be how our brain processes information ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) and learns to filter it ([[Brains are biased by nature]]). We are also limited in our capacity to make decisions ([[Working memory is limited]]) which we can view as a combination of our physical and cognitive capabilities ([[Mind-body connection]]).

Combine it with this formal definition [theory of production process](https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/theory-of-production/the-production-process-with-diagram/19900)

## Theory of production process

### Economics and managerial definition of production process

> In **traditional economics**, the term ‘production’ is used in a broad sense. It refers to the provision of goods and services for sale in the market with a view to satisfying *human needs and wants*.
>
> In **man­agerial economics**, however, the term is used in a narrow sense to refer to the processes of physical **transformation of resources**, such as the transforma­tion of iron ore into steel or the production and as­sembly of components into a finished car.^[https://www.economicsdiscussion.net/theory-of-production/the-production-process-with-diagram/19900]
