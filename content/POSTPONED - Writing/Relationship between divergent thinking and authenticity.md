## Relationship between divergent thinking and authenticity

Review this video [Why divergent thinkers beat geniuses in the real world | David Epstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js4NiTFq9Pw "Why divergent thinkers beat geniuses in the real world | David Epstein")

It talks about the ability to absorb knowledge from different field.

I was having my therapy session with [[Dominique Clement]] and I talked to her about my personal thoughts on the connection between [[Neuroticism|neuroticism]] and HPI as well as how it might relate to [[Geniuses and divergent thinking|Geniuses and divergent thinking]]. I'm seeing a [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|lot of myself]] in the book [[La Douance -  Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et Cr√©atif by Marianne Belanger]]. When I told her that this is the book I found at the BANQ because I felt like online literature was lacking, she confirmed that she's one of the thought leaders on HPI within the Quebec space. So that's a good sign!

My general theory if someone is able to harness the positive ([[Positive or negative sentiment override clouds emotional judgment]]) traits of neuroticism such as a greater ability for [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|associative thinking]] ([[Associative memory connects unrelated items]]), deeper empathy mechanisms ([[Empathy is the ability to relate to others]]) as a result of hypersensitivity to stimuli leading to greater emotional variance. One needs to adopt better emotional regulation ([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]) as a result of this hypersensitivity. It's interesting to think about maladaptive behaviors ([[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances]]) but I didn't stop to consider about its inverse ([[Inversion as a mental model]]) ,

When reflecting on geniuses ([[Traits of geniuses]], I see them facing the question of mortality at a young age. This drives them to be intensely curious ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]) about the world, perhaps in an attempt to reduce their [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency]], and fit their [[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss|grief]]'s ([[Grief is the emotional response to complicated loss]]) understanding into their [[Brains organize information into schemas|existing mental schemas]] ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]).

,  it can lead to great potential for talent. Perhaps this is further explored within [[Talent Is Overrated by Geoff Colvin]].
