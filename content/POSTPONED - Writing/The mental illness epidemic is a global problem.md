# The mental illness epidemic is a global problem

Related to [[Loneliness is a widespread epidemic]]

Mental illness is a global problem which affects a huge amount of individual across the world. We can consider it as a worldwide epidemic and create a huge burden on society.

For example, during the COVID-19 epidemic, a lot of people were shut down or locked inside their homes, and so many in-person mental health care services had to be halted. However, during that time, there actually had been a demand increase in mental health treatment. As a result, a lot of companies actually expanded their virtual behavioral support during this time.

## Mental illness places a big burden on society

Mental illness has a significant impact on societal productivity. According to the CAMH, it is the leading cause of disability in Canada. It creates a big economic burden on society which health care costs, lost productivity and reductions in the general quality of life.

> Mental illness is a leading cause of disability in this country, preventing nearly 500,000 employed Canadians from attending work each week. To make matters worse, the cost of disability leave as a result of mental illness is about double the cost of leave due to physical illness. All in, the economic burden of mental illness in Canada is an estimated $51 billion per year including health care costs, lost productivity and reductions in health-related quality of life.^[https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real]

> [!ai]- AI Summary
>
> Mental illness is a global problem that affects millions of people, with around 450 million individuals currently struggling with it worldwide.
>
> In Canada alone, over 6.7 million people have or have had a mental illness by the time they reach 40 years old. This alarming statistic highlights the need for everyone to get involved in addressing this issue. The impact of mental illness is not only felt by individuals but also has immense costs to society. It is a leading cause of disability, resulting in nearly 500,000 employed Canadians being unable to work each week.
>
> Additionally, the economic burden of mental illness in Canada amounts to an estimated $51 billion per year, including healthcare costs and lost productivity. The human cost is even greater, as mental illness is interconnected with addiction and physical health issues. Opioid overdoses now cause more deaths than car accidents in Canada, while suicide claims the lives of over 4,000 Canadians annually.
>
> People with mental illness are also at higher risk of developing long-term medical conditions and substance use problems, leading to premature mortality. Access to mental health services remains a major barrier, particularly for children, as 75% of children with mental disorders do not have access to specialized treatment services.
>
> Despite the significant impact of mental illness on individuals and society, it receives only a small fraction of healthcare funding and resources, resulting in inadequate care for many Canadians.^[ [The Mental Health Crisis Is Real | CAMH](https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real)]

I would also imagine that underserved communities and those with access to less economic resources do not get appropriate care and treatment for mental illnesses.

## The effect on mental illness on personal health

> Most people don't think of mental illness as something you can die from. At least not in the same way that people die from cancer, heart disease or diabetes. Yet the inter-relationship between addictions and other forms of mental illness, and their connection to physical health, is undeniable. Here again, the numbers are all too real.
>
> - Opioid overdoses now account for more deaths in Canada than automobile accidents.
> - The World Health Organization estimates one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds.
> - Over 4,000 Canadians die by suicide every year—an average of 11 per day.
> - People with mood disorders are at much higher risk of developing a long-term medical condition.
> - People with mental illness are two times more likely to have a substance use problem versus the general population.
> - People with mental illness and addiction are more likely to die prematurely versus the general population.

## Access to mental health service is a huge barrier to mental healthcare

> While mental illness accounts for about 10 per cent of the burden of disease in Ontario, it receives just seven per cent of health care dollars. This shortfall, totalling almost $1.5 billion, creates an ever-widening gap in the system's ability to deliver timely intervention and adequate long-term care.
>
> - Only half of Canadians experiencing a major depressive episode receive "potentially adequate care."
> - One-third of Canadians aged 15 or older who report having a need for mental health care say those needs were not fully met.
> - 75 per cent of children with mental disorders do not have access to specialized treatment services.
> - Aboriginal youth are about five to six times more likely to die by suicide than non-Aboriginal youth. Suicide rates for Inuit youth are among the highest in the world, at 11 times the national average.^[https://www.camh.ca/en/driving-change/the-crisis-is-real]

It indicates a significant rise in the prevalence and impact of mental health disorders on individuals and society as a whole.
