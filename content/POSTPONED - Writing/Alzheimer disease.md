> Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the brain and leads to memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for about 60-80% of cases. The disease typically begins with mild memory loss and gradually worsens over time, eventually interfering with daily tasks and independence. While the exact cause is unknown, Alzheimer's is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors.

As a last few years, my grandma suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She lives socially isolated in life as she is living independently with declining cognitive faculties and limited social opportunities. The families in general denial above her health condition and refuses [[Make quick and decisive actions|to take active decisions]].

> ### Topic: Understanding Memory and Alzheimer's
>
> Lisa Genova, an author and neuroscientist, debunks common misconceptions we have about our memory. She explains that the ability to remember everything is not a function of a normal brain. In her book 'Remember: The Science of Memory and The Art of Forgetting', she explains that forgetting information, such as names or tasks to do, is entirely normal.
>
> However, many fear ordinary moments of forgetting as they associate it with Alzheimer's disease, a progressive disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Only around 2% of Alzheimer's cases are entirely hereditary, and most Alzheimer's symptoms differ from typical forgetfulness.
>
> Alzheimer's starts with the accumulation of a sticky protein, 'amyloid beta,' that forms 'amyloid plaques.' If these plaques accumulate enough in the brain, it leads to other complications like neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammation, and cell death. This process typically takes 15 to 20 years, and this accumulation happens even when you're symptom-free.
>
> ### Alzheimer's Symptoms
>
> The first signs of Alzheimer's arise from damage to the hippocampus, the part of your brain that creates new memories. As a result, you may not remember what someone said a few minutes ago, repeat yourself frequently, or forget events from the past week. As the disease progresses, it affects your frontal lobe, resulting in problems with problem-solving and decision-making. It can eventually affect the parts of your brain that handle language and spatial awareness, leading to difficulties with word recall and navigational challenges.
>
> ### Lifestyle Factors Impacting Alzheimer’s Risk
>
> There are several lifestyle factors that can influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques and thus the risk of Alzheimer's:
>
> 1. **Sleep:** Adequate sleep enables glial cells, the janitors of the brain, to clear away accumulated metabolic debris, including amyloid beta.
>
> 2. **Diet:** A balanced diet, like the 'Mediterranean' or 'MIND' diet, full of leafy vegetables, fruits, fatty fish, nuts, and olive oil, can reduce the risk by one third to half.
>
> 3. **Exercise:** Regular physical activity decreases amyloid plaque levels and reduces the risk of Alzheimer's.
>
> 4. **Stress Management:** Chronic stress can shrink the hippocampus, making it essential to manage stress with activities like yoga, meditation, and social interaction.
>
> 5. **[[Learning new things is often difficult|Learning new things]]:** Building a cognitive reserve through continuous learning forms new neural connections and builds redundancy, allowing the brain to bypass the damage caused by Alzheimer's to some extent.
>
> Ultimately, our lifestyle choices can help prevent Alzheimer's as effectively as any potential medication. Forgetting due to Alzheimer's is frightening, but the forgetfulness we experience daily should not be alarming. It's important to understand and differentiate between normal memory function and symptoms of Alzheimer's.
