## Interacting with large language models

Here are some tools I'm using to interact with [[Large language models produce human text using big data|large language models]]:
- GPT4All which is a desktop CPU-based client
- LM Studio which can easily import [[Machine learning collaboration platforms|HuggingFace]] models
- [ChatGPT-web](https://niek.github.io/chatgpt-web/#/chat/1) a web interface for interaction with the OpenAI API which is a bit cheaper than paying for GPT-4 Plus subscription
	- It's a web wrapper for GPT-4

### Frameworks for interacting with LLMs

- Langchain is a wrapper to easily interact with various models
	- [LangChain: Introduction and Getting Started | Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/langchain-intro/)
- What is [[Machine learning collaboration platforms|HuggingFace]]? I see it mentioned everywhere. It's a repo that hosts [[Large language models produce human text using big data|LLMs]], like Github but more specific.
- OpenAI
