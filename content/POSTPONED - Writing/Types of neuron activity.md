# Types of neuron activity

While reading through [[Haoyi Qiu]]'s papers on Parvalbumin protein controls (wtf) they talk about how neuronal activity patterns fire.

They mention the key words of tonic to adaptive firing. I wasn't sure what that means but since I'm a naturally [[Curiosity as my worldview|curious]] person I wanted to know more about what those terms meant as I was uncertain.

Neurons can exhibit these patterns of firing:

Neuron pattern type | Scientific definition | ELI5
--|--|--
Tonic | Regularly spaced spikes | A tone is a steady periodic sound - like a metronome or graphing out a sine wave function with a consistent period (Î») [[Pasted image 20230207104851.png\|(See image)]]
Adapting | Gradually increasing interspike intervals | Like an increase in amplitude over time, like a [[Pasted image 20230207104707.png\|function describing a wave (See image)]]
Bursting | Regular alternations between short and long interspike intervals | Kinda like skewed graphs? [[Pasted image 20230207104938.png\|(See image)]]

All of these are different patterns of wavelengths and graph shapes which can all be described mathematically with wave functions ([[Waves]]).
