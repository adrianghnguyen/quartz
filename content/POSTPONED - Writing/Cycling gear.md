## Cycling gear and gagdets

- [[2023-10-13|Friday October 13th 2023]] Suunto Race smartwatch based on this [review from DC Rainmaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTfHig5PwzI&t=267s&pp=ygUMZGMgcmFpbm1ha2Vy)
	- [Suunto Race All Black â€“ For racing and training](https://www.suunto.com/en-ca/Products/sports-watches/suunto-race/suunto-race-all-black/)
	- It can measure [[HRV Frequency Measurements|HRV]] 
	- Sleep metrics which may be important to [[Sleep is important|do sleep tracking]]
	- Can measure the impact of my training load
	- Would it help improve my commitment to fitness by rewarding me with numbers and tracking my personal progress?
	- Route navigation

## Bike frames and groupsets

There's a lot of competition from Chinese manufacturers coming out with their own versions of alloy frames, groupsets, etc.

Here's an interesting model:
- Polygon Bend R9X
	- [Best (mid-level) Gravel Bike You've Never Heard of - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ryVVI9ojcI&list=FL-R_W9_aQkw4WThIwolPj9A&index=1&t=4s)
	- comes with a wireless groupset along with a lots of mounts. 

For my next bike purchase, I think I would like a gravel bike for which I could go gravel bikepacking. That would also mean that I would need to purchase bike racks/fenders, sleeping equipment, etc. Something to think about. There's a whole host of auxiliary equipment which needs to go alongside.

Here are my requirements:
- Decently wide tire clearance ( >40mm minimum)
- Mounting points
- Disc brake (mechanical is fine IMO)
- Tubeless tires
	- If I'm going long distances, I don't think I want to bother dealing with flats
	- The thing about tubeless is that it requires sealants and on-the-road fixes which cannot be fixed by a plug kit may prove to be more difficult
- Do I want 1x vs 2x? 
	- Since I would like for it to be an all-road bike and may need to ride roads to get there, would a 2x be better? It adds some faff to the setup though. I think the only way to really know is to try riding one to be able to tell what I would like.


### Groupsets

- Big 3 (Shimano, Campagnolo, SRAM)
- Ltwoo
	- Up-and-coming and they even released their electronic group set recently but that's still being ironed out based on information from TraceVelo

## Cycling clothing

### Kits

Right now my favourite bibs are from Assos. I also have a pair of shorts from them. Jersey-wise, they're all the same to me to be honest. I wear a Small in them though. Medium is just too drapey.

- Assos

### Urban cycling clothing

For getting around and commuting

- Lululemon
	- I bought a pair of the "License to Train Linerless Short 7" from Lululemon which are supposedly abrasion resistant
- Isadore
	- Asking on Reddit, someone recommended Isadore? [Urban Shorts Khaki](https://isadore.com/urban-shorts-khaki) They make cycling kits so they have experience with them. I find the inseam to be quite long which I'm not as fond of to be honest.
