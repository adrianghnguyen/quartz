## Factors for personality development

These are five of the factors which play a significant impact in the personality of our development:^[http://studylecturenotes.com/factors-of-personality-biological-social-cultural-situational/]

1. Biological Factors - Our natural biological traits and their natural response curves
2. Social Factors - Experiences with groups, other individuals
3. Cultural Factors - The norms and values of the society
4. Physical Environment - Where we occupy physical place such as quality of water, land, geography
5. Situational Factors - We may act differently depending on the situation/context. For example, our personality will be different between family versus with close friends.

- environments shape our motivations/outcomes
- the inside is a reflection of the outside
- Childhood and childhood development
- Examples of culture affecting how we grow up
	- Stereotypes and build in stimulus response
- We are shaped by the biases ([[Brains are biased by nature]]) which we encode into our memories ([[Memory is processed information]])
- Context sensitivity from matthewmathosis

- How our internal mind shapes our decisions
	- Talk about [[Notes Central Hub/Psychology/Mental Health]]?
- Most things are connected one way or another
	- Most systems are interdependent
		- Internal and external factors
- improve memory by taking advantage of environmental cues to prime ([[Priming effects]]) certain behaviors.
- [[Nature promotes connectivity]] and how the way these networks are influenced by their context
> 	- The formation and nature of these networks is context-dependent, and can be influenced by factors such as [soil fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_fertility "Soil fertility"), resource availability, host or myco-symbiont genotype, disturbance and seasonal variation.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network#cite_note-Simard2012-6)

- [[Priming effects]] and how we interpret stimuli . This in turns affects our [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|ability to process information]] ([[Memory is processed information]])

## Outsourcing our behaviour

[[Our environment shapes our behaviour]]

Up to 95% of American soldiers stationed abroad during the Vietnam War had heavy dependency on drugs up. However, upon the return, only six per cent were still addicted. On the other hand, homebound treatment in the US has a relapse rate of 90%.

How do we explain this gap in behavior? And how come some of them were not addicted upon their return? This finding contradicted a lot of what was known at concerning addiction during that period of time. *"According to [Wendy Wood](http://dornsife.usc.edu/wendywood/home/), a psychologist at University of Southern California who researches behavior change, throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s scientists believed that if you wanted to change [[Stages involved in behavioral change|behavior]], the key was to change people's goals and intentions."*
