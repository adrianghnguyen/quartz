## The little monitor's job

> Imagine a little monitor, like a referee, sitting next to your brain’s [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|emotional One ring]]. She’s got two jobs, this monitor:
>
> 1.  She watches to make sure the world is behaving according to her expectations (expectations set by all her previous experience with the world).
> 2.  She directs the investigation when there is any discrepancy between the world and her expectations. (sounds like [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]])
>
> When the world is meeting her expectations, the monitor feels satisfied. Nothing is lacking. But sometimes there is a gap between the world and the expectations—some ambiguity needs to be resolved, some novelty needs to be explored to see where it fits in the expected order of things, or some very appealing stimulus needs to be approached and obtained.
>
> When this happens, she goes into **command mode.** She makes reducing the discrepancy her purpose in life. Her entire world is made up of these three things:
>
> -   The goal state of closing the gap—which might mean resolve the ambiguity, explore the new thing, approach the incentive, or simply complete the task
> -   The effort you’re investing in the pursuit of that goal state—the attention, resources, and time you’re allocating to it
> -   The progress you’re making toward that goal state
> \- [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]

## Criterion velocity monitoring

Schwarzer and Frensch, Personality, Human Development, and Culture, chap. 1. <-describes criterion velocity

effort-reward ratio monitoring or falling short of goals

> The little monitor keeps track of how much progress you’re making in relation to how much effort you’re investing. She tallies your effort-to-progress ratio, and she has a strong opinion about what that ratio should be.
>
> When the monitor feels that you’re making good progress—when you’re matching or exceeding the criterion velocity—she is satisfied, motivated, eager. But when the monitor feels that you’re not making enough progress, she begins to become frustrated, and she prompts you to increase your efforts to get closer to your goal. If you still aren’t making enough progress to satisfy the little monitor, she begins to get angry . . . and then enraged! And eventually, if you continue to fall short, at a certain point the little monitor gives up and pushes you off an emotional cliff into the “[[Dealing with mental illness|pit of despair]],” as the monitor becomes convinced that the goal is unattainable. You give up in [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopeless]] desolation.

> When you’re continually failing to reach a sexual incentive, your little monitor grows frustrated and then angered and eventually despairing. And that’s why it sometimes feels like an unpleasant internal experience. It’s not the desire itself that feels unpleasant, it’s your criterion velocity being unsatisfied. In other words, it’s not how you feel . . . it’s how you feel about how you feel.

> criterion velocity—your expectation about how much effort should be required to achieve this goal.
