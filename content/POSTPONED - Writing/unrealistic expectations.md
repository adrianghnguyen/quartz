# Unrealistic expectations

#status/postponed 

---

It's about expecting too much. It will be met with disappointment, whether it be about our [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career]], our [[Unrealistic relationship expectations make us unhappy|love life]] or about our personal selves. [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|Humans have a tendency to never be satisfied.]] We search for ever-lofty goals but we fall short - because nothing is ever more perfect than the imagined.
