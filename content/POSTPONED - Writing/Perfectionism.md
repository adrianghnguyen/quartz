> Perfectionism refers to a personality trait characterized by the pursuit of flawlessness and the setting of extremely high standards, accompanied by a tendency to be overly critical of one's own performance. Individuals who exhibit perfectionistic tendencies often strive for excellence in every aspect of their lives, seeking flawless outcomes and avoiding mistakes at all costs. While having high standards can be beneficial in certain situations, excessive perfectionism can be detrimental to one's well-being and productivity.

Perhaps it's adjusting our mindset or re-framing our expectations of the others to perceive them as who they are. While talking with my friend %%[[Eunice Kim|Eunice]]%%, she mentioned the tie between being a perfectionist and [[Unrealistic relationship expectations make us unhappy|expecting too much from others]]. It's something I'll need to reflect upon.

I would like to let go on my need to think that I need to get the right answer - [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|Life is a lifelong journey of discovery so it is best to approach it with a mindset of enjoyment towards experimentation]]. I'm trying to [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|become a better person]] and ingrain this as part of a [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|kind inner voice]] towards myself in order to practice [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]].

## Type of perfectionism

There are two main types of perfectionism:

1. **Adaptive Perfectionism**: This type of perfectionism involves setting high standards and pursuing excellence while maintaining a realistic and healthy approach. Individuals with adaptive perfectionism are generally motivated to achieve their goals and derive satisfaction from their accomplishments without being overly critical of themselves or experiencing excessive stress.
2. **Maladaptive Perfectionism**: This type of perfectionism is characterized by setting unrealistic and unattainable standards, along with a tendency to excessively focus on mistakes and shortcomings. People with maladaptive perfectionism often experience anxiety, fear of failure, and an intense need for approval. This approach can lead to chronic stress, [[Emotional and physical burnout|burnout]], and a negative impact on mental health.

I am still trying to learn how to unlearn the former.

## **Related Topics and Concepts**

- **Self-Esteem**: Perfectionism often intersects with self-esteem, as individuals with high levels of perfectionism may tie their self-worth to their ability to meet their own impossibly high standards. Exploring the relationship between perfectionism and self-esteem can provide valuable insights into one's self-perception and psychological well-being.
- **Imposter Syndrome**: Imposter syndrome refers to the persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evidence of competence and success. Many perfectionists struggle with imposter syndrome, as they constantly doubt their accomplishments and worry that others will discover their perceived flaws or limitations.
- **Procrastination**: Perfectionism can contribute to procrastination, as individuals may delay starting or completing tasks due to the fear of not being able to meet their own high standards. Understanding how perfectionism and procrastination are interconnected can help in developing strategies to overcome this cycle and enhance productivity.
- **Mindset**: Perfectionism is strongly influenced by one's mindset, such as a fixed mindset (believing abilities are fixed and unchangeable) or a growth mindset (believing abilities can be developed and improved). Exploring the impact of mindset on perfectionism can provide insights into promoting a healthier perspective on personal growth and achievements.
