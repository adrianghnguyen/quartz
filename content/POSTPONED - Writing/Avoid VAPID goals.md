It's easy to set VAPID or vague goals according to [[REF 7 Ways to Maximize Misery ðŸ˜ž|REF 7 Ways to Maximize Misery ðŸ˜ž]].
1. Vague
2. Amorphous
3. Pie-in-the-sky
4. Irrelevant
5. Delayed

Examples of [[Create effective goals|Actionable Goals]]:
- **Vague Goal:** "Improve fitness."
- **Actionable Goal:** "Attend the gym three times a week and complete a 30-minute cardio workout each session."
- **Vague Goal:** "Read more books."
- **Actionable Goal:** "Read one book on personal development by the end of the month."
- **Vague Goal:** "Eat healthier."
- **Actionable Goal:** "Cook at least four homemade meals a week using fresh ingredients."

There are the kinds of goals where the objective is unclear and the path is unclear. When motivation strikes, it's easy to try to go [[Feeling fully alive is about engagement|all-in]] and aim ridiculously high which brings us back to dissapointment since it is clearly not achievable. It's also how we can fall into the [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive trap]] of always [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|shifting the goalposts]].

It's a surefire way to guarantee [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|feelings of failure]]. It's better to build [[Creating effective habits|effective habits]] and [[Make quick and decisive actions|take decisive actions]] rather than waiting for motivation to strike - something that is easily fleeting.
