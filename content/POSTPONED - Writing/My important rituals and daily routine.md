# My important rituals and daily routine

#status/postponed

Related to [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits]]

These should derived from [[My personal principles|my life principles]]

Some of my important rituals which we can think of as habits:

- Set the phone charging in the office when at home to create out of sight, out of mind.
	- It's easy to become [[Attentional bias|easily distracted]] so practicing [[Digital Minimalism|digital minimalism]]
- I consider [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] incredibly important so I've placed it to the top of my daily stack queue
	- by putting it as my first task to complete in the morning. Wake up, have coffee and meditate while taking my medication, vitamin D and light therapy for my sleep schedule.
- Related to the point above, protecting my [[Sleep is important|sleep]]
	- It's where our [[Memory is processed information|memories]] are formed is supremely important. [[Sleep is important|Good sleep]] means better decision-making and is a self-reinforcing cycle. It helps control my health as well as my stress levels.
- Set limited social time availability between Thursday-Sunday with the remaining time reserved for deep thinking and [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]]
	- I have a tendency to stretch myself too thin in terms of my social network and trying to do too many social activities to [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|overcome my loneliness]]. I think it's important to [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|manage my energy wisely]] and not overdo it.
	- It would be good to set up a healthy limit for my social activities so I've tried to build in fail-sales into my [[My social calendar|my personal calendar]]

## Morning routine

### Wake up early and make my bed

> [!NOTE] I like this video - starting the day off right
> [Ben Sherman: The Original Button Up Since 1963 / PART 2 - RITUAL - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1dSolyuUaI&list=FL-R_W9_aQkw4WThIwolPj9A)

It's about [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|starting the day off right with a small victory]] and the opportunity to [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|practice mindfulness]] by really engaging with my surroundings. It's [[Grow by practicing gratefulness towards tasks and behaviors|practicing gratefulness towards]] my bedroom and its environment. It's starting with the mindset of doing things the right way.

- I also have my friend's photos which help remind me that I am not alone and [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|belong to a community]].
- My friend %% [[Rachel Cao]]%% made me a cute planter which I sometimes look at in the bedroom.
- I have a picture of [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad]] who is an important part of my life.

> [!task] Pick out my clothes the night before?

### Take a shower in darkness while listening to music

After a few minutes, [[The experience of listening to music|music starts playing in the bathroom]]. It's something I really enjoy and gets me in a good mood.

I take a shower in darkness because it helps focus on [[Mind-body connection|reconnecting my mind and body]]. It's also the experience of [[Somatic therapy|practicing somatic meditation]].

### Make my espresso

Afterwards, I go out and make my espresso. Espresso is an interesting [[Understanding the complexity of life|metaphor for life]]. You might be doing the same thing as yesterday, yet the outcome might be different. On some days, the coffee is good. On other days,  it is bad. It's a good reminder to [[Stay grounded and maintain perspective|Stay grounded and maintain perspective]].

### Meditate with blue blight

I consider meditation to be one of the most important things I can do to start off the day correctly. There's a lot of associated benefits to [[Breathe slowly and take a deep breath|focusing on our breath]] and practicing mindfulness. I feel like when I do this, I can start off the day with a [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|calm state of mind and feeling at peace and bliss]].

One of the strategies I use in creating accountability in [[Creating effective habits|building good habits]] is to do a daily check-in with my friend %% [[Tim Vieregge|Tim Vieregge]]%%. It's the technique of social accountability.

I also use a blue light as a way to create a non intrusive timer as well as helping me wake up and set my circadian rhythm.

## Nighttime routine

### Avoid eating late at night

When speaking to my friend %% [[Annie Chen]] %%, she brought up the point that eating too late at night disrupts our circadian rhythm and prevents us from easily going to bed. There's a fine balance to achieve in not going too bed too hungry nor too full.

I know that when I am emotionally upset or [[Stressors are things which activate stress responses|feeling stressed]], I might indulge in emotional eating.

### Turn off the cellphone and leave it outside of the bedroom

We tend to be in a more negative or pessimistic mood when it comes to nighttime. As a way of putting off tomorrow, I sometimes enjoy in [[Social media is a poor cure for boredom|doom scrolling]] or look for other ways of distracting myself from my own mind. I'm trying to introduce [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|friction in my negative habit]] to distance myself and channel it into [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|positive behavioural change]].

### Journaling and scribbling ruminations

It may be beneficial at that time to learn to dump my mind's content by [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditating]], [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]] and scribbling my random thoughts. It's using [[Reduce mental load through cognitive offloading strategies]].

- [[Negative thoughts are highest at night|Negative thoughts are highest at night]]

### Sleeping early

> [!warning] This is a challenging one.

Trying to go to bed beforeâ€¦?

It's been a struggle for me due to my insomnia, which is most likely psychological in its nature due to a racing mind. I would honestly love to be able to sleep early.

- [[Daily habits consist of daily actions]]
- [[Sleep is important|Sleep is important for our well-being]]
- [[Maintain sleep hygiene|A good sleep hygiene routine improves our sleep quality]]

It would be important to learn how to respect my circadian rhythm. I've always been more of a night owl but how much of that is due to disturbed sleep and inability to fall asleep rather than my natural tendencies?

According to the video, we can manipulate our circadian rhythm by exposure to blue light or to the sunlight as we wake up.
