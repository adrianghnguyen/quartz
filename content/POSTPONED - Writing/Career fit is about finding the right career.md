I need to think about how this fits in with [[My ideal work|my ideal career]]. 

1. Do informational interviews about people in the existing roles and ask for feedback as in terms of potential fit
2. Determine your starting point and current track record
3. Are you [[Gut feelings|personally excited]] about it? Can I imagine myself [[The Happiness Equation|enjoying it]]?

## What is personal fit and why is it important?

> [!note]- *Personal fit is about your chances of excelling at a job, if you work at it* 
> - Your _personal fit_ for a job is the chance that — if you worked at it — you’d end up excelling.
> - Personal fit is even more important than most people think, because it increases your impact, job satisfaction, and career capital.
> - Research shows that it’s hard to work out what you’re going to be good at ahead of time. Career tests, trying to introspect, or just “going with your gut” seem like poor ways of figuring this out.
> - Instead, think like a scientist: make some best guesses (hypotheses) about which careers could be a good fit, identify your _key uncertainties_ about those guesses, then _go and investigate_ those uncertainties.
> - Look for the cheapest ways of testing your options first, creating a ‘ladder’ of tests. Usually this means starting by speaking to people already working in the job. Later it could involve applying to jobs or finding ways to do short projects that are similar to actually doing the work.
> - It can take years to find your fit, and you’ll never be certain about it. So even once you take a job, see it too as an experiment. Try it for a couple of years, then update your best guesses.
> - Early in your career, if you have the security, it can be worth planning to try out several career paths, aiming high, and being ready to quit if something is going so-so rather than great. You can make this easier by carefully considering which order to explore your options, and making good backup plans.

Personal fit is where one can excel in terms of [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career]]. It matters because the right career fit helps us find [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|meaningful work]], increase the impact of our work and helps us develop [[Career capital|career capital]]. 

The right personal fit acts as an important multiplier the supportive factors (career capital, impact, supportive conditions) of our career development journey. Think of it as an accelerator since there is alignment between what's right for you and the work that you do. The right career fit helps us [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|become our best selves]] by becoming really good at what we do.

There's evidence that only a small portion of people who become significant contributors to their field of work, following the [[Pareto principle|Pareto principle]] - the ones who become experts. It also supports the [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|craftsman mindset]] when it comes to building career capital. 

The challenge comes in the fact that this is something which can be impossible to discover beforehand. It may require [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|lifelong journey of discovery]] with many years of experimentation - possible leading to [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]]. As for myself, I feel like being able to find the career fit will allow me to live a more [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|authentic life]].

### The supporting factors of personal fit

In order to find career success according to [[The organization 80 000 hours|80,000 Hours]], we need the following three factors combined with personal fit:
- career capital
- impact
- supportive work conditions

## An action plan finding the right career fit

> [!NOTE]- Advanced: what are the best ways to predict career fit, according to the research? according to [[The organization 80 000 hours|the organization 80,000 Hours]]
> Our key advice on predicting fit is to define your key uncertainties and go investigate them in whatever way seems most helpful.
>
> But it’s also true that, based on the research and our experience, some approaches to predicting fit seem better than others.
>
> You can use these prompts to better target your efforts to gain information, and to make better guesses before you start doing lots of investigation.
>
> 1. **What is the job actually like?** We often meet people who speculate on their fit for, say, working in government, but have little idea what civil servants actually do. Before you go any further, try to get the basics down: Can you describe what a typical day might look like? What tasks create value in the job? What does it take to do them well?
> 2. **What do experts say?** If you can, ask people experienced in the field about how well you’d perform — especially people with experience recruiting for the job in question. But be careful — don’t put too much weight on a single person’s view! And try to find people who are likely to be honest with you.
> 3. **What’s been working for you so far?**[5](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#fn-5) One simple method to predict your success is to project forward your track record. If you’ve been succeeding in a path, that’s normally a good reason to continue. You can also try to use your track record to make more precise estimates of your chances. For instance, if you’re at grad school, roughly the top half of your class will go into academia, so if you’re in the top 25% of your class at grad school, you could roughly guess you’ll be in the top 50% of academia.[6](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#fn-6) To get a better sense of your potential over the long term, you should try to look at your _rate of improvement_ rather than just recent performance.[7](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#fn-7)
> 4. **What drives success in the area, and how do you stack up?** Your answers to steps 1–3 give you a starting point, but then you can modify that up or down depending on specific factors that could increase or decrease your chances of success. The aim is to develop a model of what’s needed for success. You can try to do this by asking people in the field about what’s most needed, and trying to understand what causes people to succeed or not. Then try to assess how you stack up on these predictors. This is how (good) job interviews work: they try to identify the traits most important for the job, and then ask you about evidence that you’ve displayed those traits in the past.
> 5. **Does the job match your strengths?** One useful way to find your strengths is to look for activities that don’t feel like work to you, but do for most people. We have [an article with an evidence-driven process to assess your personal strengths](https://80000hours.org/articles/personal-strengths/).
> 6. **Do you feel excited about it?** Gut-level motivation _isn’t_ a reliable predictor of success. But if you _don’t_ feel motivated, you probably won’t be able to put in the effort you’d need to to perform well. So a lack of excitement should definitely give you pause; it might be worth exploring what precisely you find uninspiring.
> 7. **Will you enjoy it?** This matters even if you mainly care about social impact: to stick with _any_ career for long enough to make a difference, it’ll need to be reasonably enjoyable and fit with the rest of your life. For example, if you want a family, you’ll probably want a job without extreme working hours.
> 8. **Combine all these perspectives.** Predicting career success is hard, and there’s no single approach that’s reliable. So it’s useful to consider all of the perspectives above, and focus on options that seem good from several of them.

Something to think about when I [[My career reflections and planning|reflect about my career journey]] so far. This can serve as a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] when it comes to finding the right career fit

1. Do informational interviews and find out what the prospective job would look like
2. Ask them for feedback on how likely you are a good fit - but don't forget that we shouldn't take a single opinion too much to heart
3. Look at my current track record and rate of improvement to determine a potential starting point
4. Looking at the previous 3 points - and evaluate my current success
	1. Am I succeeding in this field?
	2. How do I stack up compared to others?
	3. **Develop a [[Model of success|model of success]] for a particular domain**.
5. Am I excited about it?
	1. No sense in doing something that doesn't at least tingle a modicum of interest, but it's worth at least parsing what my gut feeling tells me if it's a lack of excitement.
6. Can I enjoy it to a reasonable extent? Otherwise it will be hard to stick with long term.

## Finding the right career fit requires experimentation

Early in our careers career we should with experiment several career paths, aim high and [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|be ready to quit]] if something is going so-so rather than great^[[4 biases to avoid in career decisions - 80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/articles/4-biases-to-avoid-in-career-decisions/)].

- Carefully consider which career options to explore
- Look for cheap ways to explore career options through a [[Ladder of tests|ladder of tests]]
- Create backup plans and risk-mitigation strategies
- Don't necessarily go with the first [[Gut feelings|gut feeling]] when it comes to [[Career decision-making|making career choices]]
- Experimenting for career fit can look like [[Learn new skills through projects|testing out new projects]] to find out if a [[Self-discovery is about trying new things|subject truly interests us]]
