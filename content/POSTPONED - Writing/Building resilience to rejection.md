# Build rejection resilience through practice

- [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth]]

## Why rejection hurts

As humans, it's easy to have a [[Fear of rejection|fear of rejection]] but this also makes us less likely to [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|stretch our social muscles]]. Rejection is often [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|painful]] because it creates feelings of [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|isolation]]. This experience of perception of rejection, by being seemingly alone, can even take [[Loneliness and its negative impact on health|its toll on our health]].

In some sense, we are putting ourselves at [[Emotional vulnerability is the willingness and ability to express true emotions|emotional risk]] when we are making a [[Sliding door moments are opportunities for connection and turning towards your partner|bid for connection]] and seeking their support/help/whatever.

And it's totally within their prerogative to say no. Most of the time, people are kind and not cruel. It's not even personal when they reject us - they may be busy, may not be the right time or simply not the right person. So it's important to not personalize the rejection and take it as a reflection of our personal self-worth.

Being rejected can feel like a [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|personal failure]] - did I do something wrong? Should I have done or said something differently? Most of the time, our actions were completely neutral - it's important to not [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|imagine the worst possible case scenarios]]. Most people don't care about us as much as we care about their evaluation of us as a person - impacting our [[Self-confidence|self-confidence]].

Even if we do experience a rejection, it's important to remember our [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common humanity]]. It's okay to [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|make mistakes]]. We're all dumb humans and going to do dumb things. [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|Self-compassion]] is important in those moments.

I have a lot of [[Attachment wounds and trauma|attachment wounds]] so I'm particularly sensitive so it's something I seek to actively practice and get better at.

## Getting used to rejection requires practice

According to Dr. McFadden, expanding our nervous system through sensory experiences can lead to an increased capacity for rejection, and rejection doesn't necessarily have the same negative impact as before.

Additionally, being [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|part of a community]] can provide a safety net to help individuals push past the [[Fear of rejection|fear of being rejected]]. In other words, we can increase our [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]].

We get better at [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|handling it]] with time and the negative emotions which may come with it. It's better to have a [[Let the world decide the value of your work|so what attitude]]. Additionally, building up self-esteem probably makes the experience [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|less painful]].

> So if I understand this correctly that would mean that we can increase our capacity to deal with rejection by exposing ourselves to it? In a way, it helps us [[Overstimulation and sensory fatigue|desensitize]] our triggered responses. I guess [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|anything can be a habit]].

### Overcoming the loneliness of rejection requires risk

The solution to loneliness is to put ourselves out there, [[Entrepreneurial love is taking risks with the heart|take emotional risks]], and connect with others to improve our social skills, [[Neuroplasticity|neuronal connections]], and overall satisfaction. But it might mean that along the way, we'll face rejection in some shape our form - but it's important to not let that dissuade us from making such efforts.
