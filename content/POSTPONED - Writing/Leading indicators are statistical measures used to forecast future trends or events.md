> Leading indicators are statistical measures used to forecast future trends or events. They provide early signals or warnings about potential changes in the economy, business activity, or other areas of interest. Unlike lagging indicators, which confirm trends that have already occurred, leading indicators aim to predict future outcomes based on current data. Examples of leading indicators include stock market performance, consumer confidence surveys, and housing starts. Monitoring and analyzing leading indicators can help businesses and policymakers [[make informed decisions]] and take proactive measures to mitigate risks or seize opportunities.
