# Ethics of data collection in therapeutic settings

#status/postponed

---

I want to know that if I proceed with the [[ChatGPT Therapy Session Sentiment Heatmap]] project, can I use this data for meta analysis if it's abstracted? HIPPA would probably cover a lot of it. I may be able to talk to [Hypercare/Albert](https://www.hypercare.com/) to know more about this field.

Ideally, I would like to get the audio recording of therapy sessions, transcribe and then do theme analysis. Afterwards, I would create a person entity which would be abstracted. This would then be anonymized and fed into a greater meta-analysis dataset.

I'm somewhat inspired by Mindhunter ([[My movies and TV Shows]]) where they talk about how most research is done within labs but getting in-field information on psychopaths and serial killers is a whole new world to them.
