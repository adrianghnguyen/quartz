## Physics process

>
> [Classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics") is typically concerned with everyday conditions: speeds are much lower than the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light"), sizes are much greater than that of atoms, and energies are relatively small. Modern physics, however, is concerned with more extreme conditions, such as high velocities that are comparable to the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light "Speed of light") (special relativity), small distances comparable to the [atomic radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius "Atomic radius") ([quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics")), and very high energies (relativity). In general, quantum and relativistic effects are believed to exist across all scales, although these effects may be very small at [human scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_scale "Human scale"). While quantum mechanics is compatible with special relativity (See: [Relativistic quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativistic_quantum_mechanics "Relativistic quantum mechanics")), one of the [unsolved problems in physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics "List of unsolved problems in physics") is the unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity, which the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model "Standard Model") of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") currently cannot account for.

> Modern physics is an effort to understand the underlying processes of the interactions of matter using the tools of science & engineering. In a literal sense, the term _modern physics_ means up-to-date physics. In this sense, a significant portion of so-called _[classical physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_physics "Classical physics")_ is modern.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics#cite_note-richtmyer-1) However, since roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant [paradigm shifts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift"):[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics#cite_note-richtmyer-1) especially the advent of [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") (QM) and [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity") (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of either QM or ER (or both) is said to be _modern physics_. It is in this latter sense that the term is generally used.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics#cite_note-richtmyer-1)

## Chemical processes

> **Unit processing** is the basic processing in [chemical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering "Chemical engineering"). Together with [unit operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_operation "Unit operation") it forms the main principle of the varied chemical industries. Each genre of unit processing follows the same chemical law much as each genre of [unit operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_operation "Unit operation") follows the same physical law.
