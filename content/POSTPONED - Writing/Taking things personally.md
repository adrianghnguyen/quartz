> What's the term for taking things personally when the action is neutral?

> This example highlights two biased forms of thinking that involve taking things too personally. The first is _personalisation_, which is believing that you’re the cause of a negative event, despite having little or no evidence to support the belief. In my case, I thought I had missed out on an opportunity because I upset my friend, even though I had no idea what I had done. The second is _mind reading_, which is believing that someone is making a critical judgment about you, especially in an ambiguous situation where you’ve received no direct feedback. Again, in my case, I assumed that my friend thought I wouldn’t be fun to bring to a game, basing my belief solely on the fact that I wasn’t invited.
