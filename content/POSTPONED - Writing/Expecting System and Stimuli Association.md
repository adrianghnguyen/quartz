# Expecting System and Stimuli Association

#status/postponed

Related to [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center]]

Expectation is defined as the process of creating the association between the here and now, present, and what should happen next otherwise known as *expectations*.

Expecting is linked to the [[Prefrontal Cortex|prefrontal cortex]] (PFC), which is part of the [[Mesocorticolimbic system|mesocorticolimbic system]] that includes the [[Mesolimbic pathway is the emotional center of the brain|mesolimbic pathway]]. The [[Prefrontal Cortex|PFC]] is involved in representing and updating our expectations about the future, and it can modulate the activity of the mesolimbic pathway, influencing the release of dopamine in the NAc.

> Pavlov’s dogs salivated when a bell rang because their expecting system connected the bell with food. The rats in chapter 2 linked lemons or jackets with sex, and baby Frankie and baby Frannie’s brains coupled genital response, internal sensations, and external environment because of the expecting system. This is **implicit learning**—a different experience from explicit learning.

> **Explicit learning** is memorizing a poem with [[Spaced repetition is superior to rote memorization|spaced repetition]] and conscious effort (through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]). Implicit learning is (in part) the expecting system linking stimuli across time and space. We don’t have to study or memorize anything to learn which foods taste delicious and which people are mean. We learn these kinds of emotional things implicitly.

Explicit learning would be linked to [[long-term memory]] storage ([[Types of memories]]). Implicit learning would be innate learned response behaviours closely related to trauma and things we've absorbed during our childhood without being explicitly told.
