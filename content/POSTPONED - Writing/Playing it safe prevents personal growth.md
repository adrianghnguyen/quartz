## Playing it safe prevents growth according to Jonathan Haidt

> [!NOTE] We take less risks than before
> Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist teaching at the NYU Stern School of Business. In 2019, he published _The Coddling of the American Mind_ with Greg Lukianoff, an attorney and CEO of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. The book laid out groundbreaking research that showed young people are exposed to less risk than before and that parents and educators emphasize safety more than they did in the past.

The point of that research is to show that risk and danger are natural elements of physical and emotional environment - something similar to the [[View challenges as opportunities|need for stressors in environments]] explained within [[Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Antifragile by Nassim Nicholas Taleb]]. I would also assume that it decreases our tolerance for risk, increasing our susceptibility for [[Fear|fear]].

Too much safety can prevent us from having a [[Entrepreneurial love is taking risks with the heart|healthy development of love]].

For example, there's evidence that those who spend more time on [[Social media epidemic contributes to the mental health crisis|social media]] are less likely to engage in [[Take calculated risks like an entrepreneur|entrepreneurial]] and [[Entrepreneurial love is taking risks with the heart|romantic risks]].

If we wish to experience new things in life, we need to [[Behavioural change is difficult|break out of our comfortable habits]].
