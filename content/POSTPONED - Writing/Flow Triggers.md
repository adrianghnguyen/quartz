Related to [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence]]

## Necessary for Conditions

- Have clear goals
- Clear and immediate feedback ([[Continuous feedback leads to change]]) which can intrinsic or extrinsic
- Challenge equilibrium - not too hard, not to easy

## Flow Triggers

There are 22 triggers for [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|flow state]].

Flow only appears when all of our attention is in the right gear, in the present. The reason why meditation is a good exercise for the brain is because it trains the brain to stay in the present ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]]). We've made the link that anxiety ([[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health]]) prevents us from entering the flow state.

Flow state triggers are driven by [[Dopamine]] triggers

- Drives focus, attention, alertness, excitement
- There are multiple mechanisms for dopamine production
	- Novelty
	- Unpredictability <- novel music can be unpredictable. from [[The experience of listening to music]] we know that we seek patterns. Jazz tends to be more free-form and break patterns, it's perhaps why so many creative musicians are inherently drawn to its free form nature with how unpredictable it can be.
	- Complexity ([[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts]])
	- Experience of awe
		- "You look up at the night sky and you see stars everywhere and you know those stars are actually universes, and you get sorta perceptual vastness." <- I got a similar feeling when I had my spiritual moment…need to find which day it was around [[2023-01-12 Thu]]? I can review within Google timeline to check when I went for that walk
	- Risk-taking
		- Physical, emotional ([[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited]]), intellectual risks (what does this mean? curiosity? Learning new things? ([[Learn new skills through projects]]) spiritual risks…idk wtf that means
- Dopamine allows us to enhance our pattern recognition capabilities. Is this a link to [[Neural Network]] and how search for pattern? I now know the dopamine production is a contributing factor to pattterns? When we give further weights to neural networks, are we giving them the equivalent to digital dopamine?
	- former myth: dopamine is a reward for risk-taking. So did we reverse cause and effect? dopamine is released by risk-taking or is risk-taking what release dopamine? *I need to think and reflect on this section*
	- Current theory - dopamine is the motivational factor link to SDT ([[Humans are motivated to grow]])
		- Five intrinsic motivational factors points
			- These are interlinked and work in linear order, with a specific sequence
			- Most basic human motivation is curiosity
				- this is a trait highlighted within HIP ([[Geniuses and divergent thinking]])
				- Curiosity allows us to focus for free. When we become curious about something, we don't struggle nor burn many calories - relate this to [[Theory of Neural Efficiency]] trying to focus
					- Is focusing on things metabolically expensive? Does it consume a lot of energy? How can we relate glucose as an input ([[Inputs are transformed into outputs]]) to flow-type thinking?
					- **Curiosity** is tied biologically to passion
						- An example is love ([[Love and Relationships]]). We pay a lot of attention onto the other we are in love, often thinking about them ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]). Being in love, ([[Love is shown through actions]]) is a great source of focus.
						- **Passion** is also linked to **purpose**, ([[Find your niche]])
							- Link to [[Incremental goals help sustain grit]] like having a specific dream or micro-goals? These need to become effective goals ([[Purpose in life]])?
							- It may be an altruistic goal, and it may be society-serving but from the science of peak performance, it's selfish.
								- When we have purpose, we wish to have autonomy (([[Traits defining great work]])), in order to pursue said purpose/goal.
							-As long as you have a general goal, don't sweat the small stuff using the [[Black Box method]] to do your best and get started ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]])?
						- Freedom aka autonomy leads to mastery ([[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]])
							- humans are built to seek peak performance ([[Humans are motivated to grow]])
- Complete concentration
	- Find optimal work timings where we have peak creative output - [[My love letter to StarCraft]] <- StarCraft also has timing attacks
	- Practice attention management ([[Become focused by managing attention]])
		- Turn off notifs, emails, etc. Anything that can possible distract outside the task ([[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind]]) will set back your flow state - such as door knocks, etc.
		- Setback can be as much as 15 minutes <- bring this reference to attention management
- Curiosity,
- mastery and
- challenging difficulty to the point of discomfort (but not snapping) are essential states
- passion
- purpose
- Risk-taking (physical and otherwise)
	- Can we link this to the science of music ([[The experience of listening to music]])?

There's a lot of commonalities with [[Traits defining great work]] which highlights the belief within self-efficacy and autonomy. <- That's tied to SDT [[Humans are motivated to grow]]

You wish to avoid distractions through attention management ([[Become focused by managing attention]])

there may be a relationship to [[Geniuses and divergent thinking]] and the [[Theory of Neural Efficiency|glucose efficiency theory]]

Is there a lin kbetween flow state and [[Delaying gratification can increase willpower and lead to positive life outcome|delayed gratification]]? [Stanford marshmallow experiment - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment#:~:text=The%20Stanford%20marshmallow%20experiment%20was,for%20a%20period%20of%20time.)
Apparently it's been challenged in 2020 replication studies

- Being able to persist at problems is like waiting for the marshmallow. you'll keep working at the problem until you solve it because of intense curiosity or desire for flow state found in HIP children ([[Geniuses and divergent thinking]])

> [!NOTE] A philosophical approach to flow
> Motivation allows us to begin. Learning allows us to continue to play. Creativity is how we steer. And flow, peak performance, is how we amplify all the results beyond our imagination.
