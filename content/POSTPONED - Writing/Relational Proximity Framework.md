## Definition of relational proximity

> **Measure of the distance in the relationship between two people, groups or organisations**. It determines how well each can understand the intentions and performance of the other.^[https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2013/09/relational-proximity-framework.pdf]

> Relational Proximity is defined in terms of five main relational domains: communication, time, knowledge, power and purpose. In the model, these are a part of every relationship, whether inter-personal or inter-organisational.^[https://relationalschools.org/about/relational-proximity-framework/]

### Relationship to proximity effect

According to Social Psychology, one of the factors of attraction is “**Proximity Effect**”.

Proximity Effect is related to the time that people spend together. A lot of research found out that there is a **positive correlation between the amount of time spent together and the attraction between people.**

## Reflections

Is this why we people who spend a lot of time together tend to fall in love/get closer?

Relationship to [[The need to belong is the root of social connection]]?. It's talked a lot about in [[Connected by Nicholas A Christakis James H Fowler]] which I read during my social psych class I think.

Maybe since I'm [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|sensitivie]], and tend to become attached to people due to my hypersensitivity (hyper)
