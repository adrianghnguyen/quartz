It's also known and was identified by something called the Duchenne smile. When we are happy, we tend to smile which is something that was observed across cultures. As a result of this exercise, our [[HRV Frequency Measurements|heart rate]] slows down and it can help our body [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|relieve stress]].

This process engages the following muscles: Orbicularis oculi and Zygomaticus major.

It's also a process which can be done in reverse. That means that forcing ourselves to smile can actually make us happy. It's reversing cause and effect. *As little as 90 seconds* of making a smile can make us happy.

Maybe that's why we should avoid people who are constantly frowning. Maybe they're deeply unhappy.
