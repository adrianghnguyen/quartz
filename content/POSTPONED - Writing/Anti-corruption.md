## Effective anti-corruption policies

Effective policies to root out governmental corruption involve a combination of preventive, detective, and punitive measures, as well as ongoing monitoring and evaluation. Some key policies and strategies include:

1.  Transparency and open government: Promote transparency and accessibility of information by implementing open data initiatives, freedom of information legislation, and maintaining public records.
2.  Strong legal framework: Develop comprehensive anti-corruption laws that criminalize different forms of corruption, including bribery, embezzlement, and nepotism, and establish clear regulations for public procurement and financial management.
3.  Independent anti-corruption agencies: Establish independent and well-resourced anti-corruption agencies with the power to investigate and prosecute corruption cases.
4.  Strengthening internal controls: Implement strong internal control systems within government institutions, including clear reporting lines and separation of duties, to minimize the opportunity for corrupt practices.
5.  Whistleblower protection: Encourage reporting of corruption by providing legal protection and support for whistleblowers.
6.  Public procurement reform: Implement transparent and competitive public procurement processes, with

1. Strengthening of Anti-Corruption Legislation: The enactment of strong anti-corruption laws is one of the most effective measures to combat corruption. These laws should be comprehensive and include provisions for transparency, accountability, and punishment for offenders. (Source: Lambsdorff, J. G., et al. "The control of corruption." Journal of Policy Modeling 23.3 (2001): 271-283.)

> 2. Whistleblower Protection: Whistleblower protection laws protect individuals who report corruption from retaliatory actions by their employers or government officials. This encourages individuals to come forward and report corrupt practices without fear of losing their jobs or facing other consequences. (Source: Banisar, D., & Long, K. "Whistleblowing and transparency: a global assessment." (2009).)
>
> 3. Strengthening of Public Procurement Systems: Corruption in public procurement is a major source of financial loss to governments and undermines public trust in government institutions. Strengthening public procurement systems through the use of competitive bidding processes, clear rules and regulations, and independent oversight can significantly reduce corruption in this area. (Source: World Bank Group "Preventing Corruption in Public Procurement." (2016).)
>
> 4. Strengthening of Judicial System: An independent judiciary that is free from political interference is essential for combating corruption as it ensures that corrupt officials are held accountable for their actions. This can be achieved through strengthening judicial systems by providing adequate resources, training judges on anti-corruption measures, and enacting laws that protect judicial independence.(Source: Kaufmann, D., Kraay, A., & Zoido-Lobatón, P."Governance matters III: governance indicators for 1996-2002." World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series 3106 (2003).)

> 5. Implementation of e-Government Systems: The use of e-government systems can significantly reduce corruption by reducing the opportunities for corrupt practices. E-government systems can increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency by providing citizens with access to government services and information online. (Source: UNDP "E-Government for Good Governance in Developing Countries." (2016).)

## Measuring anti-corruption levels

To measure the effectiveness of these efforts, various indexes and indicators are used. Some of the most notable include:

| Metric                                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)                 | Published by Transparency International, the CPI ranks countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption, with higher rankings indicating lower corruption levels. Most commonly used |
| World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) | The WGI includes an indicator called "Control of Corruption," which measures the extent to which public power is exercised for private gain.                                                        |
| Global Corruption Barometer (GCB)                  | Also published by Transparency International, the GCB surveys citizens worldwide to gauge their experiences and perceptions of corruption in their countries.                                       |
| Open Budget Index (OBI)                            | The OBI assesses the transparency and accountability of countries' budget processes, which can be an indicator of how effectively corruption is being addressed.                                    |

By tracking changes in these indicators and comparing them to the progress made in implementing anti-corruption policies, the effectiveness of a country's efforts to root out corruption can be assessed.

## Examples of countries which have made progress against anti-corruption

| Country | Examples of anti-corruption measures | Effectiveness |
|---------|------------------------------------|---------------|
> | Singapore | - Establishment of Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau <br> - Strict enforcement of anti-corruption laws <br> - High salaries for government officials <br> - Whistleblower protection | Ranked as the least corrupt country in the world by Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) for several years |
> | Rwanda | - Use of technology to reduce opportunities for corruption, such as electronic payment systems and online services <br> - Regular performance evaluations for government officials <br> - Public awareness campaigns against corruption | Significantly improved its CPI score over the years, rising from 26 in 2008 to 53 in 2020 |
> | Georgia | - Creation of an independent anti-corruption agency <br> - Introduction of e-government to reduce opportunities for corruption <br> - Implementation of merit-based civil service recruitment and promotions | Saw a significant improvement in its CPI score from 3.9 in 2004 to 56 in 2020 |
> | Hong Kong | - Strong legal framework against corruption with heavy penalties <br> - Independent commission against corruption with investigative powers <br> - Disclosure requirements for public officials' assets and interests | Consistently ranks high on the CPI, with a score of 77 in 2020 |

>
> Note: Effectiveness can be measured by looking at a country's CPI score, which is based on surveys and assessments conducted by various organizations that measure perceptions of corruption. A higher CPI score indicates lower levels of perceived corruption.
