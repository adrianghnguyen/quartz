### Putting yourself in the other's shoes

It's creating an empathic thought towards the one who hurt us by placing ourselves in their shoes.

The just like me technique is essentially [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|practicing empathy]] by placing ourselves in their shoes and [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|recognizing shared humanity]] that we are not alone in our feelings of distress.

It's practicing the [[Tong-Len philosophy is exchanging hurt for empathy|Tong-Len philosophy to exchange personal hurt with a compassionate attitude]].

> [!NOTE]- Just like me

> ### **1. just like me** 
>
> This is a super simple technique with big value. The way it works is that you create connection with the person you’re feeling negative emotions toward. I find a good way to do this, even when you’re not feeling connected to them in the moment, is to add the clause “just like me” to any thought you’re having about them.

> #### Example
> When Nadia used this technique, the effectiveness became apparent. “Looking back,” she observed, “I would have said she the other female leader is trying to make a meaningful impact on the business and her career success, _just like me_. She’s not that different from me.”

> We tend to [[Fundamental attribution error|cut ourselves a break]] (thanks to cognitive biases like the [fundamental attribution error](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/the-fundamental-attribution-error)). Creating that connection with the other is a quick way to build [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|empathy]] and create a more merciful interpretation of the situation.

### Pause and get curious

[[Breathe slowly and take a deep breath|Breathe slowly and take a deep breath]]. Then get curious by making a conscious choice about how you wish to react instead of opting for a [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|knee jerk response]].

> [!NOTE]- Pause and get curious

> ### **2. pause and get curious**
>
> The second technique I regularly use is equally simple. I find that, if I take a [[Breathe slowly and take a deep breath|deep breath]] and ask a question of myself or of the other person, it gives me [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|enough space to make a choice about how I want to respond]]—rather than [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|reacting with a knee-jerk response]]. It allows me to get curious about my initial reactions, feel into my emotions, and [[Being patient leads to better decisions|make better decisions]].
