- Suburbia is a source and has racist undertones
- Biking and walking is so much more fun
- Cars cut you off from nature and connecting from society. it promotes isolation
- Biking infrastructure generates positive economic benefits.

## Car-centric culture

Our media portrays bias in how it describes car fatalities as compare to other types of accidents.

## How did society become car dependent? and what are some key factors?

> [!ai] AI
>  One of the key issues in urbanism is the increasing dependence on cars as a primary mode of transportation. This dependence has had significant impacts on urban design, public health, and environmental sustainability.
>
> The rise of car dependence can be traced back to several key factors. One of the most important is the post-World War II suburbanization of America. After the war, there was a tremendous demand for housing, and developers responded by building new homes in sprawling suburban areas. These suburbs were often located far from city centers and lacked public transportation options, making cars a necessity for getting around.
>
> Another factor contributing to car dependence was the construction of highways and other road infrastructure. In the 1950s and 1960s, federal funding was made available to build highways that connected cities and suburbs. This led to an increase in car ownership and usage as people found it easier to commute long distances by car.
>
> The decline of public transportation also played a role in promoting car use. In many cities, public transit systems were neglected or dismantled in favor of building more roads for cars. This made it more difficult for people without cars to get around and increased reliance on personal vehicles.
>
> Finally, cultural factors also contributed to car dependence. Cars were seen as symbols of freedom and independence, while public transportation was often stigmatized as being only for those who couldn't afford a car.
>
> Overall, these factors have all contributed to a society that is heavily dependent on cars for transportation. However, there are growing efforts to promote alternatives like biking, walking, and public transit that could reduce our reliance on cars and create more sustainable cities for future generations.

- Racial lines and divides. Highways cut across marginalized communities. Suburban Homes became a possible dogwhistle for racism.

### What is the cost burden of car dependency?

#### Economics of car dependency

- Per square footage, the math works out in favour of urban cities which generate tax dollars
- Cars are a lot less efficient in terms of allocation of resources as opposed to common transit.

#### Health and mental health costs of car dependency

#### Wealth burden on the less wealthy

Cars are outrageously expensive, and they place an undue burden on people with less income. However, this is a lesser known cost because people are often bad at calculating amortized costs over the lifetime of a car.
