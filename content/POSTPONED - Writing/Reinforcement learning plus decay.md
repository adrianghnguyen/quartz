> In order to better understand how we learn what to ignore, Niv’s lab has used a task called the dimensions task. Participants in an fMRI scanner are shown sets of stimuli with different dimensions (i.e., color, shape, texture). To earn a reward, they must learn which item to select out of the set. Features from only one relevant dimension — assigned by the researchers — determine the probability of reward. The rub is that participants are not told ahead of time what dimension is relevant and what target feature will get them the reward.

> Niv then uses this trial-by-trial choice data to develop computational models that reflect participants’ learning and decision-making strategies. In 10 years of working with this task, the Niv lab has determined that participants **don’t appear** to be using simple reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference, or simple hypothesis testing, she said. Instead, the best model uses what they **call feature reinforcement learning plus decay**: After each trial, the value of each of the chosen features is updated and adjusted to reflect any prediction errors, while all other values are decayed toward zero, to mimic less attention to those.

> “What I’m trying to understand is how cognition shapes what we attend to and how we decide what to attend to,” Niv explained. “What we have shown so far is that attention constrains what we learn about, and we consider this a feature, not a bug; by constraining learning to only the dimensions that are relevant to the task, we can learn to cross the street in 10 trials and not in 10,000 trials.”^[Michel, A.
