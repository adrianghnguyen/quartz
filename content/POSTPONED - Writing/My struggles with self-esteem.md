# My struggles with self-esteem

#status/postponed

Related to [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself]]

This is something I can struggle with at times due to my [[The trauma of abandonment|trauma of abandonment]]. It made me feel like I don't deserve to be here or that I am unwanted by the world.

There are times at night when I think to myself, why would anyone want to be with me which leads to much [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]], amplified by [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]].

My mind can sometimes go to very dark places. I think back to some of my childhood experiences where people who I thought were important in my life were not able to show up for me. There are many nights where, for example, I sat at the door, crying, wanting for someone to take care of me. Based on my knowledge, this creates a deep sense of alienation. It makes us feel like we're unwanted in the world.

I felt [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|emotionally neglected]] and sought ways to understand my sense of being and purpose in the world by pursuing psychology. [[Running on Empty by Jonice Webb|Running on Empty by Jonice Webb]] helped me introduce me to the concept and although it was not intentional, things turned out that way.

## Personal reflections on self-esteem

I had some very interesting conversations on the multiple facets of [[The various ways of loving yourself|self-love]] recently. I saw the two dualities - my friend confronted her emotions and made space for them while [[Tran Huynh|my mother]] chose the [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego#1. Denial|defensive route of suppressing our emotions]]. Neither habit comes easy as it is very disarming to recognize a new part of ourselves, exemplified by [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]]. [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|It takes time]] to integrate this into our self-image and changes to our self-perception.

After having a conversation with my [[Maellig Le Mezec|massage therapist]], she helped me understand that [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|Self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves]]. You become a fortress of your self-image when you know who you are - *[[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|authenticity]]* - where nothing can impregnate your self-esteem's walls. It means that criticism, from internal or external forces are no longer able to affect you.
