> Minimum viable products (MVPs) are simplified versions of products or services that are created with the minimum amount of features required to satisfy early customers and gather feedback for future development. The goal of an MVP is to test the market demand for a product or service while minimizing the risk and cost associated with full-scale development. MVPs typically have limited functionality, but they allow businesses to test hypotheses, validate assumptions, and iterate quickly based on user feedback.
