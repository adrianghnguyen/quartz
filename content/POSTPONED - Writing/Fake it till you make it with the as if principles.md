According to the [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|as if principle]], we can fake a quality until we actually have it. Behaving as if you we are happy or successful requires [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]].

Modern self-improvement texts universally direct us to **change how we think** in order to change how we behave. Dr. Richard Wiseman states that instead  we can focus on actions which will change how we think and feel. We get the same results, only faster and, according to Wiseman’s studies, more consistently and reliably.

[[Happiness requires action|It can also be applied towards our happiness. We can model the happiness we seek to achieve in life.]]

## Emotions can be triggered by the movements and behaviors of our body

In an essay written in 1884, the philosopher and psychologist William James postulated that instead of our emotions flowing from our mind to the body, the emotions we feel may begin in the body and flow to the mind.

This means that even if your mind does not feel emotions, like happiness or fear, the movements and behaviors of our body can trigger the emotions going to our minds. Given this structure, it is frequently our bodies and behavior that hold the key to triggering the emotions we want to experience.

This was further researched by Richard Wiseman, a British professor in Public Understanding of Psychology in his book [The As If Principle](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-as-if-principle/).

As a result, [[Happiness requires action|Happiness requires us to act happy]].

## A book summary of The As If Principle by Richard Wiseman

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> "The As If Principle" by Richard Wiseman is a self-help book that explores the power of acting as if in order to achieve personal and professional goals. Wiseman argues that by adopting the mindset and behaviors of the person we want to become, we can bring about real change in our lives.
>
> The author begins by debunking the popular belief that our thoughts shape our reality. He explains that while positive thinking can be beneficial, it is not enough on its own to bring about significant change. Instead, Wiseman introduces the concept of "as if" thinking, which involves acting as if we have already achieved our goals.
> Wiseman presents numerous studies and real-life examples to support his theory. He explains how adopting the behaviors and attitudes of successful individuals can lead to actual success. By acting as if we are confident, for example, we can improve our self-esteem and performance in various areas of life.
>
> The book also delves into the role of perception in shaping our experiences. Wiseman shows how changing our perspective and focusing on the positive aspects of a situation can lead to more fulfilling outcomes. He provides practical techniques and exercises to help readers apply these principles in their everyday lives.
>
> In addition, "The As If Principle" explores the impact of social influence on our behavior. Wiseman discusses how mimicking the actions and attitudes of those around us can increase our chances of success. He provides tips on how to surround ourselves with positive role models who can inspire us to become better versions of ourselves.
>
> Overall, "The As If Principle" offers a fresh perspective on personal development by emphasizing the [[Make quick and decisive actions|power of action]] over mere positive thinking. It encourages readers to step out of their comfort zones, adopt new behaviors, and embody the qualities they aspire to possess. With its engaging writing style and evidence-based approach, this book serves as a practical guide for anyone seeking to make lasting changes in their life.
