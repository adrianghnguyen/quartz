# Mirror neurons

Mentioned here [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]

> Mirror neurons are a class of neuron that modulate their activity both when an individual executes a specific motor act and when they observe the same or similar act performed by another individual. They were first reported in the macaque monkey ventral premotor area F5 [^1] and were named mirror neurons in a subsequent publication from the same group .[^2] Ever since their discovery, there has been great interest in mirror neurons and much speculation about their possible functional role with a particular focus on their proposed role in social cognition. As Heyes [^3] wrote “[mirror neurons] intrigue both specialists and non-specialists, celebrated as a ‘revolution’ in understanding social behaviour … and ‘the driving force’ behind ‘the great leap forward’ in human evolution…” Indeed so much has been written in both peer-review literature and elsewhere about mirror neurons and their proposed functional role(s) that they have recently been given the moniker “The most hyped concept in neuroscience” .[^4]
