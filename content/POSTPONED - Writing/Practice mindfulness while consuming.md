## Enjoying food

To savour food (it's top of mind as I'm cooking for friends [[2023-03-26]]) is to honour the life force which has been given up to us. It's a [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|moment of connection]] with that being. Recognize the effort and time that took in this creature leaving Earth to be become part of your own cycle. It is a selfless act in its own way and so we should learn to recognize the value.

I've also held the personal belief for a long time that anyone who eats meat should be forced to slaughter an animal once in their life to understand the sanctity of the life which has been given to us as food. I think people are too emotionally disconnected from the experience, although not through all of their own fault.
