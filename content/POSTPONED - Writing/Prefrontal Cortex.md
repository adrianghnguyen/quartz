## Executive brain functions

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Executive brain functions refer to a set of cognitive processes that are responsible for goal-directed behavior, decision-making, planning, and problem-solving. These functions are primarily carried out by the prefrontal cortex, which is located at the front of the brain. Executive functions involve the ability to set and prioritize goals, determine appropriate actions to achieve those goals, and inhibit impulsive behaviors. They also involve working memory, which is the ability to hold and manipulate information in the mind in order to complete tasks effectively. Overall, executive brain functions play a crucial role in our ability to navigate daily life and make thoughtful decisions.

## Role of the prefrontal cortex

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The prefrontal cortex is a region of the brain located at the front of the frontal lobe. It plays a crucial role in executive functions, which include decision-making, problem-solving, planning, and impulse control. This region is responsible for higher cognitive processes such as attention, working memory, and social behavior. Damage to the prefrontal cortex can lead to difficulty in making decisions, impaired judgment, and changes in personality. Overall, the prefrontal cortex is essential for regulating complex cognitive and emotional behaviors.
