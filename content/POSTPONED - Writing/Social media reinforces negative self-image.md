Social media tends to only show the best aspects of others people's lives and makes us [[Social comparison|desire what others have]].

## Social media reduces body acceptance

Exposure to media reinforces our [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body image]]  as [[Dealing with our inner critic|self-criticism]] and increases our bodies dissatisfaction (opposite of [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body acceptance]], negative [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|mood]], both self esteem and possibly even disordered eating.^[Hawkins et al., “Thin-Ideal Media Image.”]

This would apply to porn consumption. Recognize that if we wish to take cake of our sexual well-being, be mindful of what you consume through [[Digital minimalism|digital minimalism]].

> This is perhaps most clearly illustrated by a multiyear study of the impact of Western media—especially television—on young women in Fiji. In a culture where there had been “a clear preference for a robust form,” after three years of exposure to late 1990s American television (think _Melrose Place_ and _Beverly Hills 90210_), rates of disordered eating among teenage girls rose from 13 percent to 29 percent, with 74 percent reporting that they “feel too big or too fat,” in sharp contrast to pre-TV culture. And this wasn’t just a blip—ten years later, rates of disordered eating still hovered around 25–30 percent.
