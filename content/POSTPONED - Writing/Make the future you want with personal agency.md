# We each possess the capacity for personal agency to shape our own future

#status/postponed

According to [[Self-Determination Theory seeks to understand how we make motivations related to behaviour and personality|Self-Determination Theory conceptual model]], humans are motivated to make decisions which help promote their sense of autonomy and competence. It's having a sense of personal agency with the belief that we can shape our fate and affect future outcomes. It's having a strong [[inner locus of control|Inner locus of control]]. Humans require a sense of personal agency as a [[Personal needs as a human being|basic human need]].

It would make sense that those with a high desire for their traits have a strong sense of personal agency, believing that one has the ability to shape our fate and affect future outcomes. It stands opposite to [[Learned helplessness is giving up after repeated failures|learned helplessness]].

It's true though, that the future can be quite unpredictable but we can assume a certain level of [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]] for it. Despite not knowing what to do, I learned that [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|minimizing future regret]] is a good decision heuristic.

With agency, we should seek to [[Pursue true happiness as a priority in daily life|Pursue happiness as a priority in daily life]].

## We have power over future outcomes

Related to [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach]]

In order to untangle ourselves from [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|our poor patterns of behavior]], we should seek to diversify our experiences by [[Learn new skills through projects|learning new things]], [[My personal bucket list|engaging in new activities]] - such as [[My personal bucket list|seeking out new hobbies and activities]] in order to shape the architecture of our future selves. It can be easy to [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|live anywhere else but the present]].

It's a way to [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|grow as a person]] and believing in your [[inner locus of control|inner locus of control]]. It can be hard at times to rein in our inner thoughts and selfish desires, but perhaps that's how we can become our wisest self.

## Personal reflections on making my journey in life

> I'm crying a bit today, as I came to the realization that I never really had the chance to develop my True Self during childhood. I always had to the 'little good boy', to not have the chance to have tantrums and to learn how to shape my requests, to wish things for myself.
>
> I never really had dreams or aspirations I can truly call my own until today. At the ripe age of 30, only now do I think I'm starting to understand what it is to make decisions for myself - and it's scary because if they are my own, then failure becomes that much more personal.
>
> So with it, comes the ability to see failure, or rather learning opportunities with a kinder eye.

A friend %% [[Andre Paul Johnson]] %% sent a kind response:

> [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|I can also relate with this more than you think.]] I was also the “little good boy” my whole life until I dropped out of university. While it may feel scary to be responsible for your own decisions, it’s also a lot more freeing. You realize that you don’t owe anyone your life, that it belongs to you. And that you can do anything you want with it.

> Some decisions will succeed, others will fail, but it will be YOUR journey that you get to embark on and explore.

It's about [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|enjoying the process of experimentation]] and recognizing that my [[Understanding the complexity of life|path in life]] will be unique, fraught with challenges, peaks and valleys.
