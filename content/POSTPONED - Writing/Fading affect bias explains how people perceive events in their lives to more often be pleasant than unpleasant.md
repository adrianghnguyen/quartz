It is not a [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive error]].

> The [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|affect]] associated with unpleasant events fades faster than the affect associated with pleasant events

As a result, we should look at [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transitions]] as something which will bear fruit to positive things over time. I can look at the past with [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|kindness]], to see old memories fondly.

## Thinking about it myself

I can look back at the past turning points in my life and think about them of how they led to my personal growth. I sometimes think back at the old people I've dated and how they've helped me shaped who I am today.

> The authors review the results of several studies documenting this bias and present evidence indicating that dysphoria (mild depression) disrupts such bias. Taken together, this evidence suggests that autobiographical memory represents an important exception to the theoretical claim that bad is stronger than good.
