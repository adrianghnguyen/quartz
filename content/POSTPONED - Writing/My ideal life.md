## My ideal living environment

> [!question] Where do you want to live?
> (Think city vs. suburbs, climate, etc.)

I enjoy living in the city. I think it's where I can easily maintain connections with friends and meet a lot of them. I don't want to be a place where I'm remotely isolated from people.

At the same time, I think I like somewhere which has a lot of varied weather. I know a lot of my friends like to enjoy places which are simply warm or cold or whatever, but I think variety is very interesting. It leads me to new experiences, sports and activities and things like that. I also would like a place that is very urbanist, I think, in nature and where there's a sense of community.

I have previously lived in a place like Toronto and I feel like people were too professionally focused and career was all they talked about. So a place where people feel like they can live, breathe and experience life rather than just pursuing a goal, I think.

- Thriving community
- Provides a variety of weather and possible experiences
- A place that has more than work

Possible other cities to consider:
- San Francisco - lots of community events, tons of nature around the area, and a very urban feel.
- Seattle - great music scene, beautiful nature, and a mix of professional and laid-back vibes.
- New Orleans - a vibrant culture, amazing food, and a great sense of community.
- Boston - great sports teams, lots of history and culture, and a nice blend of urban and suburban.
- Vancouver - super beautiful, great music and art scene, and a very outdoorsy vibe.
- Toronto - obviously, lots of hustle and bustle, but also tons of cultural events, great nightlife, and plenty of green spaces.
- Calgary - underrated gem, with a booming food scene, tons of festivals and events, and proximity to the Rocky Mountains.
- Ottawa - might be unexpected, but it's got a great arts and culture scene, gorgeous parks, and a laid-back, friendly vibe.

## My ideal lifestyle
