# Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast

#status/postponed

In everyday contexts where this is beneficial

Where the term comes from

- Military spec ops
- You should slow down to the pace that you can process information. By doing so, you gain greater [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|situational awareness]] and are able to respond in a timely manner. With practice and mastery of the skill, one can eventually learn to [[OODA Loop|shorten the response time and execute more quickly]].
- As humans, we have a certain limited [[Working memory is limited|amount of information we can process]] and it's necessary to not **overstimulate** as it will lead to poor decision making.

[[Creating personal space]]

## When is it worth slowing down?

[[Making difficult decisions]]

- In situations where you need to process information and how you respond is critical
- Driving example
	- When we drive, we should only move as fast as we can process the information around the environment. Otherwise, we'll fail to see our blind spots.
- Criterium bike racing
	- Criterium bike races are intense 1 hour long effort bike races with multiple riders running on short circuit laps. Average speeds can be above 40pkh meaning that proper energy conservation by drafting and pedaling in a smooth and consistent manner is key to winning. For example, competitors who fail to do so might 'burn up' their energy by pushing 1000W+ efforts in order to maintain their position and struggle to finish the race. On the other hand, it is much easier to sustain 300W+ as an endurance effort.
