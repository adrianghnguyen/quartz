## Wright's law in economies of scale

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Wright's law is a concept in economics that states that for every cumulative doubling of units produced, the cost of production decreases by a constant percentage. This phenomenon is observed in various industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, and energy production.
>
> The law was first proposed by Theodore Wright in 1936 when he studied the relationship between aircraft production and cost. He found that as the number of aircraft produced doubled, the cost of production decreased by around 20%. The same principle can be applied to other industries as well.
>
> The implications of Wright's law are significant. It suggests that economies of scale are possible, and companies can reduce their costs by increasing their production volume. This can lead to lower prices for consumers and increased profitability for companies.
>
> However, there are also limitations to Wright's law. As production increases, there may be diminishing returns or other factors that increase costs. Additionally, technological advancements may change the cost structure of an industry altogether.
>
> Overall, Wright's law is a useful tool for understanding the relationship between production volume and costs in various industries. By applying this concept, economists can develop strategies to promote growth and efficiency in these industries.

I first learned about this concept above why the US has such a strategic advantage in the production of strategic air-delivered munition such as JDAMs. They were able to standardize and provide a kit which would be able to turn all their dumb munitions into smart-delivery. We can think of it as creating an API between smart guidance and 'dumb' bombs instead of vertical integration as a single munitions unit. This provides flexibility.
