# Fear of failure requires further investigation

#status/postponed

We need to understand that identifying the fear of failure is only the beginning of the process. We need to [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|understand its root]] and from there we can learn to rebuild ourselves more strongly.  I feel like the fear of failure stops us from pursuing our [[We avoid authentic pursuits due to personal fears|true calling]] and the activities which bring us to [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]].

I need to [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|reflect deeply]] and find out what's really holding me back. Perhaps I'll be afraid of how others perceive me, or that I might not be good enough to achieve what I set out to do, such as my personal dreams and [[My career mission|career ambitions]].

> [!question] Fear of failure is related to low self-esteem?
> Apparently, fear of failure may be tied to low self-esteem, stemming from the fact that we may not be able to live up to our potential. Is it related to the fact that we might possess [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|self-limiting beliefs]]? Related to [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|Disliking yourself is self-hatred]]?

## Fear of mistakes prevent us from engaging constructively with failure

We are afraid to do things because we are [[Most mistakes we make are not that big of a deal|afraid of making mistakes]] which leads us to have strong [[Cognitive distortions|cognitive distortions]] about the consequences of our actions. It can lead us to believe that if we don't [[Perfectionism|get it right]], it'll be [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|end of the world]]. Even if we eventually [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|'fail']], we have most likely [[All learning is dependent on feedback|learned something from the experience]]. As such, [[Failure is never definitive|failure is only a temporary setback]].

[[Most mistakes we make are not that big of a deal|Most mistakes are not that big of a deal]] - and it's also a very human experience so we shouldn't wallow in too much [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] and set ourselves with unrealistic standards which will lead to inevitable disappointment.

## Fear of failure causes us to think of worst possible outcomes

> Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.
> \- Daniel Kahneman

Research shows that when we think about bad events, we tend to [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|think about their worst aspects]] while ignoring all the things that will bring change. When we think of the worst realistic scenario, it's important to stay objective by [[Use the disputation strategy to overcome pessimism through facts|disputing pessimism with facts]] and realize that it's not the end of the world.

Instead, we should consider the factors can cause us permanent harm, such as a reduction in [[Career capital|career capital]] or lead a [[The Happiness Equation|permanent reduction in happiness]] - note that this differs from [[Happiness is born hand in hand misery|avoiding misery]]. 

Instead, it can be [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|more proactive]] to think of risk-mitigation plans if the worst is yet to come.

## Fear of success may lead to self-sabotage

Apparently, some of us may be afraid of succeeding - which leads us to engage in self-sabotage. I personally don't think this applies to me. 

For the ones who do - does it stem from the fact that they may have grown with narcissistic parents who prevented them from succeeding? The parent may want to create a sense of dependency, and they're also afraid of their child becoming better than them.

## Reflection my fear of failure

Does it stem from the fact that when I was young, people would often tell me I am smart? If so, then when I encounter difficulties and struggle, it brings self-doubt. Wouldn't a smart person know better? Do better? 

Perhaps there's an intellectual superiority complex. If I am better - then why can't I figure it out? This is a double-edged sword in terms of a [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurity]]. Challenges and potential threats to this self-image I have constructed in my mind in turn become [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|shackles]]. 

Subconsciously, why would I try to reach for the stars and [[We avoid authentic pursuits due to personal fears|follow authentic pursuits]] if failing threatens this image I have of myself, of my constructed [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]]. So it leads to [[Goal achievement and avoidance|goal avoidance]] and other forms of procrastination. 

Truthfully, the thing I should tell myself that [[High intellectual potential overview|high intellectual potential]] is about [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]] and the ability to [[Willpower is the ability to exercise self-control|delay gratification]], rather than [[General Intelligence Factor|raw intellectual quotient]].
