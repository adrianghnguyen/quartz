> A nonjudgmental attitude refers to the practice of withholding personal judgments or biases when interacting with others. It involves accepting people for who they are without criticizing or condemning their thoughts, actions, or choices. It requires an open mind and a willingness to understand different perspectives without imposing one's own beliefs or values onto others. By adopting a nonjudgmental attitude, individuals can create a safe and inclusive environment that promotes empathy, acceptance, and mutual respect.

> Having a moral framework helps you navigate life and make decisions based on what you think is right. It doesn't necessarily mean you have to impose your views on others or pass judgment on them. For example, if you think greed is wrong, then you can choose not to engage in greedy behavior yourself, even if you don't judge others for doing it.

> It's one thing to have an opinion on morality in the abstract, and another thing to judge a specific person for not sharing our similar system of values.

The concept of a nonjudgmental attitude can also apply towards [[Different attitudes and philosophies towards emotions|ourselves and our personal feelings]].

## When should we share our opinions on morals and values?

> I think it can depend on a lot of factors, like the relationship you have with the other person, and whether they've asked for your input. In general, I would say it's usually not appropriate to try to impose your views on others unless they've asked for your advice. For example, if a friend comes to you for help with a problem that involves greed, you can offer your perspective as part of your advice. But if they haven't asked for your opinion, I would caution against unsolicited advice, especially about something as personal as morality. What do you think?
