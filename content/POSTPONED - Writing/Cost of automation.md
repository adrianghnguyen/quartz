## From XKCD: Seeing if something is worth automating through time saved vs effort spent

This is a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|helpful chart]] to determine how much time we should be spending on something if we are seeking to automate a solution. Often times, delivering a solution can take more engineering resources than our ultimate goal of automating the problem.

Sometimes, that means losing sight of the objective.

Here's an easy way of interpreting this table.
1. Across the x axis is how often we do the task
2. Across the y axis is how much time we would save by automating said task
3. The resulting square is the amount of time/resources we should be dedicating to said task.

For example, If it's a task which we do **yearly**, and it would save us **1 minute of time**, we should only spend  at most 5 minutes developing a solution. Otherwise, we've misallocated resources and it was inefficient.

We should all bear the fact that requirements are ever-changing due to [[Half-life of knowledge and its decay|knowledge decay]]. It can be a fool's errand to trace an ever moving target which can happen in agile environments.
