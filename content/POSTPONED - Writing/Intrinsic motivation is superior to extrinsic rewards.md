## Intrinsic motivation are internal sources of motivation

According to the modern research on happiness, intrinsic motivation is superior to to achieving long-term satisfaction and happiness as opposed to [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|extrinsic motivation]].

## Research on intrinsic vs extrinsic aspirations

> Psychologists have looked at how much well-being is gained when a person’s [[Purpose in life|dreams]] come true. They found that the happiness benefits of attaining one’s goals or ambitions depends on the kind of goal one aspires to.
>
> Achieving intrinsic aspirations (things related to personal growth) improves psychological health and personal well-being. But achieving extrinsic aspirations (like money, fame, and image) has *zero to negative impact* on psychological health and personal well-being. ^[Niemiec, Christopher P., Ryan, Richard M., and Deci, Edward L. 2009. “The Path Taken: Consequences of Attaining Intrinsic and Extrinsic Aspirations in Post-College Life.” Journal of Research in Personality 43, no. 3 (2009): 291–306.]

>
> "Happiness belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost, and kept acquisition of eternal goods within moderate limits, than it does to those who have managed to acquire more external goods than they can possibly use, and are lacking goods of the soul….Any excessive amount of such things must either cause its possessor some injury, or, at any rate, bring him no benefit."^[Aristotle, and Barker, Ernest. The Politics of Aristotle. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1946.]
