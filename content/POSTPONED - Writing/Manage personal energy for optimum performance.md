It's important to direct our personal energy towards the [[Create meaningful goals which are authentic to you|goals which are most meaningful to us in life]]. That's why we should consider [[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet|prioritize like Warren Buffet]].

> 1. Energy management is more important than time management: The authors argue that managing our energy levels is more crucial to our performance and well-being than simply managing our time. They emphasize the importance of regularly recharging our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual energy.
> 2. Performance requires recovery: The authors suggest that we need to balance periods of intense work with periods of rest and recovery in order to sustain high performance levels over the long-term. This means taking breaks throughout the day, as well as taking longer breaks from work on a regular basis.
> 3. Four key energy sources: The authors identify four key sources of energy - physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual - that need to be managed in order to perform at our best. They provide strategies for developing each of these sources.
> 4. Rituals are powerful: The authors suggest that creating daily rituals can help us manage our energy levels more effectively. These rituals can include things like meditation, exercise, and regular breaks from work.
> 5. The importance of purpose: The authors argue that having a clear sense of purpose is essential for sustaining high levels of energy and motivation. They provide strategies for discovering and clarifying one's purpose.
> 6. Mindfulness is key: The authors emphasize the importance of being present in the moment and fully engaged in what we're doing at any given time. They provide techniques for developing mindfulness and staying focused on the task at hand.
> 7. [[Incremental change|Small changes]] can lead to big results: The authors suggest that making [[Incremental change|small changes]] to how we manage our energy can have a big impact on our overall performance and well-being over time.
> 8. [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|Personal accountability]] is crucial: The authors stress the importance of taking responsibility for our own energy levels and performance outcomes, rather than relying on external factors or circumstances to dictate our success or failure.

Just as in exercise, after building out our muscles, we need time to recover. In the time of recovery is where most growth occurs. That is why it's important to consider when it is important to rest after certain efforts of exertion.

Even [[REF How To Simplify Your Life|anxiety or mental distress]] can be signs that your body is telling you to rest.
