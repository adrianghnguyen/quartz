> Double loop learning is a process that goes beyond traditional learning by questioning the underlying assumptions and values that inform our actions. It involves reflecting on our actions, outcomes, and the root causes behind them. In double loop learning, we not only make adjustments to our actions but also challenge and revise the mental models and beliefs that shape our decision-making. This form of learning encourages a deeper level of self-awareness and adaptability, leading to more effective problem-solving and decision-making in complex and uncertain situations.

It's similar to applying the [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|five whys of root cause analysis]] towards [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]] and personal behaviours which is why therapy can help us deepen our personal knowledge and [[Self-awareness is the ability to recognize and understand oneself|self-awareness]].
