# Meaningful conversations require humility and intellectual exploration that is curiosity-like

#status/postponed

Related to [[Good communication requires effortful engagement]]

Practice humility when communicating with others. It can lead to [[Have meaningful conversations|intimate conversations]] and lead to new discoveries.

## Be an intellectual explorer in conversations

It means we should take the stance of being an intellectual explorer. We should seek to recognize that they are coming from their [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal experiences]], and that they may have good reasons for holding a certain opinion.

Practicing [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|good conversations requires engagement and effort]]. We should seek to be [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|fully present]] when [[Listen with empathy during conversations|by listening closely]].

## Enter conversations from a place of understanding

We should seek to enter conversations from a place of understanding and [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|sense of humility]], rather than a place of argument.

Failure to do so means we come in with a place of adversarial intent, traits of a [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict person]], leading us to be closed off to [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|new sources of information]].

Respect the [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|diversity of knowledge]].

## Set aside personal views

Critical thinking and [[Listen with empathy during conversations|empathetic listening]] with a [[Empathy is the ability to relate to others|commitment to understand the other person's point of view]] means setting aside my personal views and my hunt for mis-step of logic for a moment.

Don't look to deconstruct the other person's argument. We often learn most [[REF How to Get Better at Admitting You're Wrong|admit when we are wrong]]. We can [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|take this new information and integrate it into our views]].

## It is impossible to know everything

Understand that it is [[Data Explosion|impossible to know everything]] and that the other person has [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique personal experiences]] which we may not have had. Take a moment to [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|be empathetic rather than looking for faults in their arguments]].

## Take presented information charitably

There is a principle in philosophy that when we are taking someone else's argument, we should give them the [[Assume positive intent using the principle of charity|benefit of the doubt through the principle of charity]] and consider their arguments with the strongest position possible.

## Embrace the gift of conversation

Good conversations often leave us smarter and [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|more curious]]. They helped us [[Ideation is the process of making new ideas|discover new ideas]] and [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|new perspectives about the world]]. This can help with [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|feelings of connection with the world and other people]].

[[Knowledge is a gift|Knowledge is a gift]] and we should enjoy this [[Searching for nuggets of happiness|opportunity for happiness]].

## Sharing knowledge and advice should be done as a gift without personal attachment

Sharing knowledge and advice should be done as a gift with [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|no strings attached]]. [[Gifts are given freely without attachment|Gifts should be given without attachment]] and [[Knowledge is a gift|knowledge is a gift]] which we can share with others.

We should remember that not all of it is welcome, and that when we give it, is it for our own sake, because we want to tell ourselves something, or is it because we truly want to give something to the other?

It's something to think about when giving out feedback. Maybe [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|stop criticizing others]]?
