Iteration, or an iterative process/approach is repeating a sequence of steps or actions until we repeat a specific goal.

It was explored as a model of human-problem solving in the [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|TOTE problem-solving model]].

For example, [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach]].

> An iterative process is a repetitive process in which a sequence of steps or actions is repeated until a desired outcome or goal is achieved. It involves breaking down a problem or task into smaller, more manageable steps, and then repeatedly performing those steps until the desired result is obtained.
> In an iterative process, each repetition or iteration builds upon the previous one, allowing for continuous improvement and refinement. It provides opportunities for feedback, learning, and adapting to changes or new information.
> Iterative processes are widely used in various fields and industries, such as software development, project management, problem-solving, and decision-making. They are particularly effective in complex and uncertain situations where the outcome cannot be clearly defined from the start.
>
> Advantages of using an iterative process include:
> 1. Flexibility: Iterative processes allow for flexibility and adaptability to changing requirements or circumstances. They can easily accommodate modifications or adjustments as needed.
> 2. Continuous improvement: Each iteration provides an opportunity to learn from previous iterations and make improvements. This leads to higher quality outcomes over time.
> 3. Early detection of issues: By breaking down a problem into smaller steps and testing them iteratively, issues or problems can be identified early on and addressed before they become critical.
> 4. Collaboration: Iterative processes often involve collaboration between team members or stakeholders. This facilitates communication, coordination, and sharing of ideas, leading to better outcomes.
> 5. Iterative Process and Failure:
> - The design process involves iteration, experimentation, and prototyping.
> - Failure and setbacks are embraced as integral parts of the design process and are opportunities for learning and improvement.
>
> Despite these advantages, iterative processes also have some limitations:
> 1. Time-consuming: Iterative processes may take longer to complete compared to linear or sequential processes because of the repeated iterations.
> 2. Uncertainty: The outcome of an iterative process may not be clear from the beginning, which can create uncertainty and ambiguity.
> 3. Increased complexity: As iterations progress, the complexity of the problem may increase, requiring more effort and resources to manage.
>
> Overall, iterative processes provide a structured approach to problem-solving and decision-making that allows for continuous learning, adaptation, and improvement. They are particularly effective in dynamic and complex environments.
