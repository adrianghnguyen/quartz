> During stress responses, the human body secretes a variety of hormones to help cope with the situation. The main hormones involved in stress responses include:
>
> 1.  [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]]: This hormone, produced in the adrenal cortex, plays a crucial role in stress response. It helps regulate blood sugar, metabolism, immune response, and inflammation. [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|Cortisol is often referred to as the "stress hormone"]]  because its levels increase significantly during stress.
> 2.  Adrenaline (epinephrine): This hormone is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is responsible for the [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger|"fight or flight" response]]. Adrenaline increases heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolic rate, preparing the body for immediate action.
> 3.  Norepinephrine (noradrenaline): Also produced in the adrenal medulla, norepinephrine works alongside adrenaline. It acts as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter, helping to increase alertness, focus, and energy levels.
> 4.  Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH): Produced in the hypothalamus, CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary gland.
> 5.  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Secreted by the pituitary gland, ACTH travels through the bloodstream to the adrenal cortex, where it stimulates the production and release of [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]].
> 6.  [[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|Oxytocin: Often called the "love hormone" or "cuddle hormone," oxytocin]] is also involved in stress response. It can help to counteract the effects of [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] and promote relaxation, trust, and social bonding.
>
> These hormones work together to prepare the body to handle stress, ensuring that it can respond quickly and efficiently to potential threats or challenges.
