## Cooking chicken breasts

- [Never Eat a Dry, Boring Chicken Breast Again | What's Eating Dan? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DivNnSNYOZE)

There are two classes of methods to prepare tender and juicy chicken breasts:
1. Chemical Techniques
	- Salting: Applying kosher salt to chicken breasts to change the muscle protein structure, allowing them to hold onto more moisture.
	- Brining: Immersing chicken breasts in a saltwater solution to season them and promote a change in protein structure for juiciness.
	- Marinades: Using salty ingredients like fish sauce in a marinade for both saltiness and meaty intensity.
	- Baking Soda: Raising the pH of the chicken's surface with baking soda to prevent proteins from squeezing tightly, resulting in tender, moist chicken.
2. Physical Techniques
	- Cooking Temperature: Avoiding overcooking by paying attention to the internal temperature. The video explains the time and temperature combinations to ensure safety while keeping chicken juicy.
	- Sous Vide: Cooking chicken breasts in a water bath at a specific temperature, guaranteeing both safety and ideal texture.
	- Low-Oven Reverse Sear: Slowly cooking chicken breasts in a low oven, then searing them for a well-browned exterior while maintaining juiciness.

### Cooking temperatures for moist chicken breasts by technique

1. **Sous Vide Temperature:**
	- When using sous vide, the video recommends cooking chicken breasts at 155°F (68.3°C) for at least **one hour** to achieve the desired texture.
2. **Low-Oven Reverse Sear Temperature:**
	1. For the low-oven reverse sear method, the presenter brings the chicken breasts to 145°F to 150°F (62.8°C to 65.6°C) on an instant-read thermometer, taking about 30 minutes.
	2. After searing, the internal temperature can easily climb to 165°F (73.9°C) due to *carryover cooking*.

## Time to achieve bacterial death in white meat

Although there is a risk of salmonella in 1/25 package of chicken breasts, there are multiple combinations of temperature and time to cook chicken to a safe temperature. It's more of a matrix classification. Bacterial death can be accomplished by holding lower temps for a longer period of time.^[https://blog.thermoworks.com/chicken/chicken-internal-temps-everything-you-need-to-know/]

We can use carryover cooking to maintain this temperature.

## Cooking dark vs light meat

In summary, the key differences in cooking between dark and white chicken meat lie in their myoglobin content, fat levels, and collagen presence. Dark meat is better suited for long, slow cooking methods, while white meat requires careful cooking to retain moisture and tenderness.

Based on the information provided in the video "Never Eat a Dry, Boring Chicken Breast Again | What's Eating Dan?" and general knowledge:

**Dark Meat (Chicken Thighs):**
- Dark meat contains more myoglobin, a dark red oxygen-binding protein. This myoglobin provides oxygen to muscles that do strenuous and continuous activity.
- The higher myoglobin content results in a darker appearance.
- Dark meat has more fat, which adds flavor and richness to the meat.
- It contains collagen, a protein that turns into gelatin when cooked for an extended period, making the meat tender and juicy.
- Dark meat is ideal for long cooking methods like braising.

**White Meat (Chicken Breasts):**
- White meat has less myoglobin, making it appear lighter in color.
- It has less fat and lacks collagen, so it's leaner and doesn't naturally have the same level of flavor as dark meat.
- White meat should be cooked to a lower temperature to retain natural moisture and prevent it from becoming dry and tough.
- It's suitable for quick cooking methods and benefits from techniques like salting or brining to enhance juiciness.
