Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. It is often referred to as the "stress hormone" because it helps the body respond to stressful situations by increasing blood sugar levels, suppressing the immune system, and altering metabolism. Cortisol levels naturally fluctuate throughout the day and are influenced by factors such as [[Maintain sleep hygiene|sleep]], [[Benefits of exercise|exercise]], and diet.
