> Reliability refers to the consistency and dependability of a system, process, or measurement to consistently produce accurate and precise results. It involves the ability of a system to perform consistently under different conditions and over time. Reliability is often measured using statistical techniques and indicators such as reliability coefficients or failure rates. High reliability is desirable as it ensures that a system or process can be trusted to deliver consistent and trustworthy outcomes.
