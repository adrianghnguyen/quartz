# Bayesian Decision Theory


Related to [[Changing beliefs|Changing beliefs]]. It's one of the [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] used in computational neuroscience under the umbrella of [[Cognitive science|cognitive science]] to further understand how humans approach decision-making as well as learning. Additionally, it's used within [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] models as applied to a variety of fields such as mathematics, financial modelling and prediction, etc.

Very interesting to see the intersection of such a concept.

### Bayes theorem of changing beliefs

> [!ai]+ AI

> Bayes theorem is a mathematical formula that helps us update our beliefs or knowledge based on new evidence. It is named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century English statistician. The theorem allows us to calculate the probability of an event happening given some prior information and new evidence. It is widely used in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, to make predictions and decisions based on uncertain information. In simple terms, Bayes theorem helps us make more [[Make informed decisions|informed decisions]] by incorporating new data into our existing knowledge.

### Bayesian approaches to Learning and Decision Making by Quentin Huys

This paper is interesting. It seems to indicate that one of the ways we approach [[Make informed decisions|decision-making frameworks]] is by using Markov Decision problems…related to Markov Chains which is used in financial analysis prediction modelling?

It talks a bit further about generative modelling frameworks for learning and decision-making.

I first came across this paper when this article [Biased belief updating in depression - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735823000569) discusses why it can be difficult for people with [[Depression|depression]] to [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|update their beliefs]]. This paper draws inspiration from computational neuroscience and Bayesian decision theory. Hmm… This is fairly recent being as studied as recently as 2016 onwards.

> This relatively nascent field of belief updating is highly relevant for the understanding of mental disorders because it provides insights into how people construe their subjective view of the world

It would maybe shed a bit of further light as to why it can be [[Changing deeply held beliefs is difficult|difficult deeply held beliefs]], especially in the context of poor mental health where we used negative cognitive [[Defensive mechanisms protect our ego|defensive mechanisms]] to reject information which would alter our worldviews.

### Bayesian Decision theory

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Bayesian decision theory is a mathematical framework that provides a systematic way to make decisions under uncertainty. It combines probability theory and decision theory to determine the best course of action based on available information and the associated probabilities of different outcomes.
>
> In Bayesian decision theory, decisions are made by maximizing the expected utility. Utility represents the value or preference assigned to different outcomes, and expected utility is the average utility across all possible outcomes weighted by their probabilities.
>
> The framework starts with a prior probability distribution that represents the decision-maker's beliefs about the uncertain variables. As new evidence becomes available, the prior distribution is updated using Bayes' theorem to obtain a posterior distribution, which reflects the updated beliefs.
>
> Based on this posterior distribution, decisions can be made by calculating the expected utilities of different actions and choosing the one with the highest expected utility. This approach takes into account both the uncertainty and potential consequences of different actions, allowing for a rational decision-making process.
>
> Bayesian decision theory is widely used in various fields such as statistics, economics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. It provides a solid foundation for making optimal decisions in situations where uncertainty is present.
