> The paradox of tolerance is a concept that highlights the tension between being tolerant and dealing with intolerance. It suggests that in order to maintain a tolerant society, there must be limits on tolerance itself. This means that a tolerant society cannot tolerate intolerance, as doing so would ultimately lead to the destruction of tolerance. The paradox arises from the need to strike a balance between freedom of speech and preventing the spread of hate speech or harmful ideologies. It reminds us that even though tolerance is important, it should not extend to those who seek to undermine or harm others.
