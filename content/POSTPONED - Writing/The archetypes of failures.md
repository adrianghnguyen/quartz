## The archetypes of failures

There are three archetypes of failures:
- Basic failure
- Complex failure
- [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|Intelligent failure]]

Basic failures should be minimized.
Complex failures should have their [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|root causes]] identified and corrected.
On the other hand, we should maximize [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]]. We learn most from [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|these kinds of failures]].

### Basic failures are mistakes which could have been avoided

Basic failure occurs when we possess sufficient knowledge about a situation yet something may go wrong. It can be considered a simple mistake.

They may differ in scale - from small (using the wrong ingredient in a recipe) to large (multi-million business error). What defines basic failure is that we know enough about the interactions of the environment and general consequences of actions. There may have been an error in execution.

Sometimes, mistakes just happens.

It's important that basic mistakes/failures are not the [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|end of the world.]] Perhaps it's the process still needing further iterations. Sometimes it's sheer dumb luck. Maybe there's something which could have been done differently. Maybe you were distracted.

I should remember to practice [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|being kind to myself when making a mistake]].

### Complex failure occur due to a perfect storm of errors

A failure with multiple causes. For example, the breakdown of the economy during COVID-19 has no single source of attributable error (supply chain, worker shortage, governmental decisions, weather patterns, etc.). Instead, it's better explained through [[Complex causality|complex causality]].

It's a perfect storm of things going poorly.
