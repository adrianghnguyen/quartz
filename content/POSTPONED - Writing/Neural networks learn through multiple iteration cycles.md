## Neural networks learn through multiple iteration cycles

It's a really silly metaphor, but I just thought about the fact that when we're training in [[Neural Network|neural networks]], they need to go through multiple generations, and a lot of them will fail or be wrong.

And if I think about myself writing these notes and learning how to reframe, for example, the concept of failure, and how I think about the experiences of learning, it's the same thing, right? How we learn best is to go through multiple cycles and feeling fast. And it's learning how to restitch my brain and being [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|cognitively flexible]]. So perhaps that's how I should think about things. I should [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|be kind to myself when making a mistake or facing a setback]]. I should keep trying things, keep failing fast. I think there's a lesson to be taken here from learning how we train neural networks.

I am essentially learning how to [[Neuroplasticity|rewire my brain]] when it comes to the concept of [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure]]. [[All learning is dependent on feedback|All learning is dependent on feedback]] and perhaps that's how I should conceptualize things.
