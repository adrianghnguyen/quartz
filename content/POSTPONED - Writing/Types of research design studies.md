## Meta-analysis

Uses [[Graph Theory]]

> A **meta-analysis** is a statistical analysis that combines the results of multiple [scientific studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial "Randomized controlled trial"). Meta-analyses can be performed when there are multiple scientific studies addressing the same question, with each individual study reporting measurements that are expected to have some degree of error. The aim then is to use approaches from [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") to derive a pooled estimate closest to the unknown common truth based on how this error is perceived. Meta-analytic results are considered the most trustworthy source of evidence by the [evidence-based medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine "Evidence-based medicine") literature. ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis]
