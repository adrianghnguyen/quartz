In addition, students reported higher [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|positive affect]] towards the reading activity. My primary takeaway is that if our attitude towards a certain level of activity is incredibly important in fostering [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]]
