> Data-driven [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|decision-making]] is an approach to [[Make informed decisions|making informed decisions]] based on the analysis and interpretation of data. It involves systematically collecting and analyzing relevant data to gain insights and guide decision-making processes. By leveraging quantitative or qualitative data, organizations, businesses, and individuals can make more accurate and objective decisions.
>
> Data-driven decision-making involves several steps. First, data is collected from various sources, such as customer surveys, market research, or operational records. Next, the data is cleaned and prepared for analysis to ensure accuracy and consistency. Then, statistical or analytical techniques are applied to the data to uncover patterns, trends, correlations, or other meaningful insights. Finally, the insights obtained are used to [[make informed decisions]], refine strategies, optimize processes, or solve complex problems.
