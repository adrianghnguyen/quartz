# Tong-Len philosophy is exchanging hurt for empathy

#status/postponed

Related to [[Module 4 Love and Relationships, Part 2]]

In [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation practice]], there is something called "Tong-Len" which is a Tibetan Buddhist philosophy.

> “Instead of moaning about your situation, feeling sorry for yourself, and being overwhelmed by anxiety and worry, you can, in fact, save yourself from additional mental pain and suffering by adopting the right attitude. Practicing Tong-Len meditation or ‘giving and receiving,’ may not necessarily succeed in alleviating the real physical pain or lead to a cure in physical terms, but what it can do is protect you from unnecessary additional psychological pain, suffering, and anguish.”

## What is Tong-Len meditation?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Tong-len meditation is a Tibetan Buddhist practice of exchanging oneself with others. It involves visualizing taking in the suffering and pain of others and giving out love, compassion, and happiness to them. The practice aims to cultivate empathy, compassion, and altruism towards all beings, including oneself and one's enemies. The meditator imagines breathing in the dark clouds of suffering from others and taking them into their own heart. Then they exhale bright light that radiates love and healing to those around them. This practice helps one develop a deeper understanding of interconnectedness and kindness towards all beings.
