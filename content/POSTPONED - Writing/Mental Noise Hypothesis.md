## Potential links between mental noise hypothesis and anxiety?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The mental noise hypothesis suggests that anxiety is caused by excessive mental activity or "noise" in the form of intrusive thoughts, worries, and ruminations. This mental noise can lead to cognitive overload and interfere with the ability to focus and think clearly.
>
> According to this hypothesis, individuals with anxiety experience a higher level of mental noise compared to those without anxiety. This excessive mental activity can be characterized by racing thoughts, constant worrying, and an inability to quiet the mind.
>
> The relationship between the mental noise hypothesis and anxiety is bidirectional. On one hand, anxiety can contribute to increased mental noise as individuals with anxiety tend to have more distressing thoughts and worries. On the other hand, excessive mental noise can also perpetuate or intensify feelings of anxiety
> .
> This hypothesis suggests that reducing mental noise through techniques such as mindfulness meditation, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or relaxation techniques may help alleviate symptoms of anxiety by calming the mind and reducing cognitive overload. By quieting the mental noise, individuals may be able to gain better control over their thoughts and reduce their overall anxiety levels.

## Mental-noise hypothesis

Those high in neuroticism will have greater variance (standard deviation) in regards to reaction time. They are more on the boundaries of the typical reaction time (either being real slow, or really quick to react).

A possible theory is that this is related one's ability for information processing ([[_MOC Information]]) and its interplay with basic cognitive operations.

A possible theory is that this is related one's ability for information processing ([[_MOC Information]]) and its interplay with basic cognitive operations. They explain that this mental-noise is related to mental preoccupations ([[Attention residue leads to a bothered mind]]) and reactivity processes. ^[Robinson, M.D; Tamir, M. (2006). "Neuroticism as mental noise: a relation between neuroticism and reaction time standard deviations". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 89 (1): 107–114. doi:10.1037/0022-3514.89.1.107. PMID 16060749.]

In an additional study is that they mentioned that those high in neuroticism - having higher mental noise - have more attention slips caused by the mechanisms of [[Associative memory connects unrelated items]].^[Flehmig, H.C., Steinborn, M., Langner, R., & Westhoff, K. (2007). "Neuroticism and the mental noise hypothesis: Relationships to lapses of attention and slips of action in everyday life". Psychology Science. 49 (4): 343–360. S2CID 49325040.]

### Additional personal notes on mental-noise hypothesis

When I was speaking with [[Dominique Clement]] she mentioned something about people with [[High intellectual potential overview|HPI]]  having markers of being overly stimulated. She made that comment after I told her that I needed to take showers in complete darkness as it allows me to focus better. %% Clean up [[Geniuses and divergent thinking]]%%

I had this [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|random thought]] in the shower on [[2023-02-02]] concerning the similarity between this concept and why people lower the volume of the radio/music when they're trying to focus on parking their car. This would be the equivalent of actively filtering out the noise in order to create an adaptive behavior / beneficial behavior.

If we remember the fact that for most concepts have dualities, an opposite but equal reaction, then [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behaviors]]such as neuroticism most likely have some kind of evolutionary advantage, especially [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative feelings]] as well - which is vigilance.

Overfit this (think of [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] models and compare it to the fact of overfitting and [[Working memory is limited|informational overload]]. I'm not so confident that overfitting is the right metaphor to explain this. Overfitting would be more similar over-correcting one's behavior - think of [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|TOTE]] and overcorrecting for a certain [[Brains are biased by nature|bias]] after receiving a [[Feedback loop|feedback cycle]].

There's a video thumbnail I saw about the [[The experience of listening to music|effects of music on the brain]]. I do wonder about this particular neuroscience.

I have a hypothesis that there's a relationship between music and the [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence|state of flow]]. Perhaps people high in neuroticism, when they've created a healthy adaptation through healthy coping behaviours are able to harness this 'mental noise' or chatter in the form of [[Associative memory connects unrelated items|associative thinking]] ([[Associative memory connects unrelated items]]).

> [!warning] WTF do they mean with reactivity processes here?
> Reactivity processes is typically defined as conforming to expected researcher behaviour. However in this case, are they applying it as if the neurotic person feels they're constantly being observed in public? Or are they referring to the specific experiments they used to study the effect.
>
> I would need to read the actual paper to understand this better.

> [!NOTE] Definition of reactivity processes
> Wikipedia defines reactivity processes as one changing their behaviour as a result of being observed or trying to conform to expectations such as the Hawthorne effect.

> [!NOTE] More about basic cognitive operations
> [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism) mentions that basic regulation processes includes regulation processes such as emotional regulation? ([[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]])

## Relationship between sexual brakes and mental noise as anxiety?

I need to reflect on this passage.

> Scenario 2. You’re stressed, exhausted, or overwhelmed, it’s very noisy in your brain, there’s heavy traffic, lots of yelling and horns honking about all the stuff that’s stressing you out. Your partner’s affectionate touch travels from your arm, up your spine, to your brain, and it says, “This is happening. What do you think?” And your brain says, “WHAT? I CAN’T HEAR YOU OVER ALL THIS NOISE!” And by then the sensation is over. (Sensations are a little bit like Snapchat.) If your partner keeps touching you, the sensation keeps asking your brain, “This is still happening. What do you think?” And eventually it might get your brain’s attention, and your brain might say, “ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I’VE GOT ALL THIS OTHER NOISE TO CONTEND WITH!” And if the sensation ever gets noticed enough to expand out of your brain’s emotional One Ring, it comes out in the form of, “Not now, honey.”
