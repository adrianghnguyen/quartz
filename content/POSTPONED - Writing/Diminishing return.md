> Diminishing returns refers to the point at which the addition of more resources or inputs to a production process leads to a decrease in the marginal output or benefit gained. In other words, as more resources are added, the rate of increase in output or benefit starts to decline. This concept is derived from the law of diminishing marginal utility and is commonly observed in economics and business. Understanding diminishing returns helps decision-makers optimize resource allocation and production levels.

For example, when it comes to money, [[Seeking additional money has diminishing returns on happiness|past a certain income, there are diminishing return on our happiness]].

## Wright's law also known as the learning curve effect for production

> Wright's law, also known as the learning curve effect, is a concept that describes the relationship between the cumulative production of a product and its cost. It states that as the cumulative production of a product doubles, its cost decreases by a constant percentage. This concept implies that with each doubling of production, there is a learning process that leads to increased efficiency and reduced costs. Wright's law is often used in industries such as manufacturing and technology to estimate future cost reductions based on past production data.
