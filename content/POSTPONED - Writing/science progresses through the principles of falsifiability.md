## Theory of falsification

> [!NOTE] We progress through learning about wrongs
> "Popper proposed an alternative scientific method based on falsification.  However, many confirming instances exist for a theory; it only takes one counter-observation to falsify it. Science progresses when a theory is shown to be wrong and a new theory is introduced that better explains the phenomena."^[McLeod, S. A. (2020, May 01). *Karl popper – theory of falsification*. Simply Psychology. www.www.www.www.www.www.simplypsychology.org/Karl-Popper.html]

### Summary

> -   Karl Popper believed that scientific knowledge is provisional – the best we can do at the moment.
> -   Popper is known for his attempt to refute the classical positivist account of the scientific method by replacing induction with the falsification principle.
> -   The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific, it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.
> -   For example, the hypothesis that “all swans are white” can be falsified by observing a black swan.
> -   For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.^[https://www.simplypsychology.org/Karl-Popper.html]
