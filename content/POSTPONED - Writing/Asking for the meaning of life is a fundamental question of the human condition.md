# Asking for the meaning of life is a fundamental question of the human condition

#status/postponed

Part of the [[Human condition is our common shared experiences on this earth|human condition]] is asking ourselves what ourselves what is the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]] and is a question that philosophers have dealt with since the beginning of time such as [[Nihilism posits that life has no inherent meaning or purpose|nihilism]] or through the Japanese concept of [[Ikigai is the harmony of purpose and fulfillment|ikigai]].

A lot of us will ask ourselves:
- why am I here?
- what should I do with my life?

It's a question that weighs heavily on our emotional experiences and our sense of happiness. Even though psychology and neuroscience]] cannot answer the [[Finding meaning in life provides us with happiness|meaning of life]] directly, some studies have begun providing clarity on this all so important question.
