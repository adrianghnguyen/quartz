> "Gut feelings" refer to an instinct or intuition that is not based on conscious thought or reasoning. They are immediate and strong reactions that often guide decision-making or prompt certain behaviors. These feelings are thought to be influenced by past experiences and subconscious elements. They are often used in situations where there is a lack of time or information for rational analysis.

It's neither good nor bad - it's simply a tool and we should be aware of its limitations as wel as when it can be beneficial. Gut feelings come from [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking system and implicit responses]].

It is best used in evolutionary selected scenarios such as understanding social cues such as reading other people's emotions. It can also be developed after significant time investment in [[Rare and valuable skills|developing a particular skill]]. For example, chess masters have done so much [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]] that they have developed internal schemas and heuristics to provide automatic responses.

Past experiences, including negative ones such as [[Traumatic experiences are a result of ignoring stress responses|traumatic experiences]], colours and [[Brains are biased by nature|bias]] this type of thought. In highly emotionally charged situations, it may be worth taking the time to step back and recognize when are no longer [[Thinking critically|thinking critically]].

## Limitations of gut feelings

It's best to avoid using gut-feelings when:
- [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|automatic thoughts]] may not provide the optimal solution as they are most likely clouded by past experience, subjectivity and personal biases
- Determining long-term outcomes such as what will make us happy in our careers and developing [[Career fit is about finding the right career|career fit]] %% job satisfaction %%
- [[Making decisions for the future can be challenging|making decisions for the long-term future]]

Conditions where using our gut-feelings can be difficult:

> 1. The results of our decisions take a long time to arrive.
> 2. We have few opportunities to practice.
> 3. The situation keeps changing.

We should instead see our gut-feelings as an advisor - it can provide us good clues. But then it's best to sit down and really think hard about what we want to do by using [[Analytical thinking is first-principles based|analytical thinking]] and thinking it through.
