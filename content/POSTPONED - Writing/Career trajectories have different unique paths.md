Related to [[Module 6 Building Your Future]]

Oftentimes when we're young, people are asking us, what are we going to do for life? What kind of job do you want? What kind of work do we want to do? Isn't it interesting how we mainly view success as being correlated with our career?

There's more to life than our careers but it is still one of the core facets of the [[PERMA Profiler measures personal flourishing across many domains|PERMA model of personal flourishing]]. [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|A meaningful life requires fulfilling work.]] [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|A fulfilling life requires trial and error.]] [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|There is a difference between a job, a career and a calling.]] The reality is that these kind of questions pop up throughout our lives, and as human beings we're [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|thinking about the future constantly]] and expect a predictable path with expected outcomes.  [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is not quite that simple.]]

Each of us will have their own unique career trajectory as a result of being [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique individuals coming from different places and have different seasons through life]]. Some people just have luckier circumstances and that's okay. There is no sense [[Social comparison|comparing ourselves to others]]. [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|Personal growth is learning to become superior to your former self.]]

It is important to find a [[Find fulfilling work to create a meaningful life|career which is meaningful to me]], rather than something I believe will please others. [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|Doing it regardless of outcome is being authentic.]]

The nature of the workplace has changed and the career marketplace has changed with it. It's natural for workers to go through multiples types of jobs. The key is to keep it focusing on making sure we're [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|finding better work]] along the way.

According to scholars, there are a few types of career paths in life, which we can contextualize in terms of potential career paths:
1. The **linear path** is like going up a flight of stairs: small progressive steps oriented in one direction.
2. The **spiral [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]]** is much like a connect-the-dots picture: there are often disparate points on the page but when you connect them all, they reveal a pattern of a picture designed by the artist. [[Being a generalist means having a broad set of skills and interests|Perhaps that is the most common paths of generalists.]]
3. The **expert path** is much like planting a tree: there may be seasons of growth and decline but the result is a lifelong commitment to one field or specialty.
4. The **transitory [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]]** is the least common, but the goal is focused on enjoyment of work rather than a certain job itself—much like sampling completely different flavors of ice cream to choose the one that tastes just right at the time.

## The career journey is not linear

This can be challenging at times but [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|the regret minimization framework]] can provide us an indication of what we should focus on. Additionally, we should listen to our deep [[Vision as deep personal expression|personal vision]].  Along the way, we may need to try different things while doing the necessary repetitions before we can finally settle on our [[Recognize your circle of competence|circle of competence]] and begin accumulating [[Career capital|career capital]].

It's okay to [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|experience setbacks]], realize [[Goal disengagement to refocus on what is important|something is not for us]] or even [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|feel stuck at times]]. It moves us in the [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|right direction]].

When I think about it for myself, I think I follow some out of the spiral [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]] as I've bounced around. Even though it's something I can understood how things go back and forth, it's interesting to be [[External validation|validated by an external source]].

Maybe I can accept that as [[Coherence is understanding our life narrative|my life story]]? A way of simplifying these paths is differentiating between [[Being a generalist means having a broad set of skills and interests|generalists]] and specialists.


### Stages of a career

If I want to maximize my social impact in my career based on the research from [[The organization 80 000 hours|the organization 80,000 Hours]], I should expect my career journey to move through the following three stages. I should keep this in my [[Career decision-making|career decisions]].

1. Explore options
2. Build [[Career capital|career capital]]
3. Bargain for what I want

> 1. **Explore:** take low-cost ways to learn about and test out promising longer-term roles, until you feel ready to bet on one for a few years. (Most likely to be the top priority ages 18–24.)
> 2. **Build career capital:** take a bet on a longer-term path that could go really well by building the [career capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/) that will most accelerate you in your chosen path, but with a backup plan. (Age 25–35.)
> 3. **Deploy:** use the career capital you’ve built to tackle pressing problems and bargain for a job you find personally satisfying. (Age 36 and up.)
> 
> And then keep updating your plan every 1–3 years as you continue to learn more and the world changes.
> 
> Career capital, exploration, and of course the impact of your work are always going to be relevant to every career decision you face, throughout your career. But your _focus_ should change over time.
> 
> The stages last different amounts of time for different people:
> 
> - If you’re especially uncertain about what to do longer term but feel like you’re learning a lot about where to focus, you might stay focused on exploration for longer (or just build transferable career capital and figure out your vision later). (Or someone mid-career who’s made a dramatic career change might shift back to exploration.)
> - If you’ve already hit diminishing returns on career capital, you might move to the deploy stage faster, and vice versa.
> - If you think work on your chosen problems is especially urgent — which many people think is the case for [AI safety](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/) — and the opportunities around today are better than those that will be around in 10 years, that’s a reason to skip to the deploy stage even _if_ you’ll be less well-prepared for it.
> 
> Next, we’ll look at some more ways we recommend going about career planning — while taking the uncertainty involved seriously.
