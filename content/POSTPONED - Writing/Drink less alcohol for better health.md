## Personal reflections on alcohol consumption - only socially

I have recently come to the conclusion that I do not enjoy consuming alcohol that much.

I feel like it impacts my [[Sleep is important|sleep quality]] and reduces my overall well-being or health. I know that it's primarily a social activity, so perhaps I should just practice it in [[Everything in moderation|moderation]]. there are new health guidelines which states that a maximum of 2 drinks should be consumed per week to have minimal health impact.^[https://ccsa.ca/canadas-guidance-alcohol-and-health]

Additionally, my medication stipulates that I should be avoiding alcohol so I feel like this is a valid reason to abstain from its consumption.

I feel like it also impacts my general performance/mental acuity even the days after. No bueno.
