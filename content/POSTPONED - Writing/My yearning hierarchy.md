# My yearning hierarchy

Related to [[Personal meaning of success and what I care about in life]]

From the article of [[REF How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why#Yearning hierarchy|How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why]], I can [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|conceptualize]] can think of the yearnings/things I desire in life as a shelf + a bowl + a trash can.

Developing an effective hierarchy of desires is about the ability to stay focused and limit the things on which we wish to expand energy. As a result, the non-negotiables and high priority items should stay small. Let's say as a [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|heuristic]], no more than 3-4 things in life should be in these categories.

Most things in life should be in the bottom 3 categories - things on which we should be [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|flexible and open-minded]]. As I design [[My ideal life|my ideal life]], I should be open to revisiting it as [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|Designing a fulfilling life requires an iterative approach]].

There are a few tiers of life priorities:
1. Non-negotiable bowl: Must-have in my life and for which I need to be single-minded pouring all effort and energy. **Limit to one item.**
2. Top priority shelf: Will put significant amount of effort and resources towards achieving. **Keep it limited.** These drive a significant amount of [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career choices]].
3. Everything else
	1. Middle shelf: Important at which not to fail
	2. Bottom shelf: Nice to have
	3. Trash can: Avoid at all cost and requires active effort to resist as it will [[Become focused by managing attention|distract me]]

It sucks to set stuff aside and deprioritize but that's important to do as it allows our non-negotiable bowl and top shelf to succeed. [[Developing priorities in life is about choosing what not to focus on|Developing priorities in life is about choosing what not to focus on.]]

## Non-negotiables in life are items to be pursued at all costs

These are things on which we want to be single-minded and are absolutely crucial to us. However, it's important to remember that there are certain drawbacks to being single-minded. People who were famous in history may have sacrificed relationships, balance, and health in their relentless pursuit.

This bucket should be limited and small. Ideally, it should be one thing, maybe 2 or 3. These are things for which we will sacrifice something else for. Having too many things in this bucket dilutes our ability to [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|focus our energy]].

## The trashcan of desires

These are things which we should avoid and may cause us to have inner conflict. I'm actually not sure what this passage is talking about right now.

> Then there’s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject—those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people’s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.
>
> As you go through this difficult prioritizing process—inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings—remember that you’re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can’t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment—motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won’t be the wise adult in the room—that’s your job.
