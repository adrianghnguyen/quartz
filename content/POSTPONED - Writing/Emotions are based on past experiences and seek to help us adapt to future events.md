Emotions are learned responses to past experiences and help us navigate future events. According to Lisa Feldman Barett, emotions are more than [[Priming effects|simple reactions to stimuli]] but something in which we [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|engage in its creation]]. There is a [[Emotions are interlinked with biology|complex interaction between biology and emotions]] with physical experiences driving emotional responses and vice versa.

With that being said, we can learn to re-encode these experiences through therapy techniques such as [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|CBT]] and learning positive self-regulation strategies such as [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional regulation]] leading to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|cognitive restructuring]].

> Contrary to the notion that emotions are inherently fixed in our brains from birth, Barrett contends that they are primarily based on past experiences and the brain’s predictions of future events. This means that emotions aren’t merely reactions thrust upon us, but something we actively participate in creating.

By doing this, we can shape the architecture of our future selves.
