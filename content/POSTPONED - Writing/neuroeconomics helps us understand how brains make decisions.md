## Definition of neuroeconomics

> [!ai]+ AI
> ## Neuroeconomics
>
> Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that combines neuroscience, economics, and psychology to study how the brain makes decisions related to economic and financial choices. It looks at the cognitive and neural processes that underlie decision making, reward processing, and the evaluation of risk and uncertainty in economic contexts. In short, neuroeconomics aims to understand how the brain influences economic behavior.
>
> One of the central concepts in neuroeconomics is the idea of "utility," or the subjective value that an individual places on an outcome or decision. This concept is often used to explain the choices people make in uncertain or risky situations, and how they weigh the potential gains and losses associated with different options. Researchers use a variety of methods to study neuroeconomics, including behavioral experiments, brain imaging techniques like fMRI, and computational modeling.
>
> Overall, the goal of neuroeconomics is to uncover the underlying neural mechanisms that drive economic decision-making, and to gain insight into how these mechanisms can be harnessed to improve decision-making in a variety of contexts, from personal finance to public policy.

## Neuroeconomics helps us understand how humans make strategic decision in trust and conflict

Standard economic models tend to poorly predict strategic decisions. As a result, scientists began looking at brain functions, which allowed us to identify why we cooperate with people, or why we have conflicts.

When studying cooperation, they sought to develop a protocol which measured brain chemical [[Oxytocin is the brain hormone of human connection|oxytocin]]. Monitoring the levels of this molecule allowed us to predict if the stranger were interacting with appears to be trustworthy or safe.
