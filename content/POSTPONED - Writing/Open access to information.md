# Open access to information is beneficial to all parties

Open access to information has socialist roots which is maybe one of the reasons why scientists tend to gravitate towards the left side of the political spectrum. They are inherent progressives and wish to challenge the status quo. It is a fundamental belief that knowledge belongs to all people and helps elevate and equalize society. It helps resolve [[Resolve information asymmetry|information asymmetry]] and is a key strategy in enforcing [[Anti-corruption|anti-corruption]] within organizations.

It involves the freedom for people to develop their own opinions and perspectives about the world by having democratic access to information. However, remember that [[Ignorant opinions should be disregarded|Not all opinions should be held valid when they come from a place of ignorance]].

%%Capitalism through its perverse structural profit incentives promotes the accumulation of resources and hoarding of it as part of its [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organizing properties]]. We steal from another because it is a zero-sum game, something explored within [[POSTPONED - Writing/Game theory|game theory]].%%

It's interesting. One of the resources I use to [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|discover new things]] is libgen.rs which is tied to [sci-hub](https://sci-hub.se/about) which has a very beautiful communist philosophy that knowledge should be free. This is apparently somewhat controversial.

> [!NOTE]- Scihub's philosophy on the distribution of knowledge
> The current system of producing knowledge in science is a classical example of a failed capitalist system. Researchers are being exploited, and do not receive money for their work: the knowledge they produce in the form of research papers, does not belong to them. And it does not belong to people either. Instead, the knowledge in science today is a private property of a few mighty businesses, who make huge amounts of money from it. Not only that system is an obstacle to the progress, but it also creates huge distances between rich and poor, where poor people are blocked from access to knowledge. And that includes such important areas as medicine and healthcare.

> All this was made possible by the fundamentally wrong concept ofÂ **intellectual property**.

> Not only intellectual property creates injustice, but is also self-contradictory. The basic unit of scientific knowledge is a publication in academic journal. But journals essentially are vehicles for communication: they exist to communicate, or to make common. Knowledge and communication are inseparable. Hence communism is the true essence of science, information and knowledge.
>
> That idea, that intelligence is inherently connected to communication, is also proven by the brain structure: brain is essentially a network of billions of neurons that communicate between each other.

> Also sociologist Robert Merton identified communism as one of the basic ethical values in science. And is not a coincidence that Soviet Union, the first communist state, was based on science.

> Personal comment: [Inventor of Sci-Hub's personal statement on the project](https://sci-hub.se/alexandra) I think she's a beautiful person who was able to promote the open information philosophy. I can't do justice to her personal statement so I'll leave this short.

The movements of open and truly free knowledge apparently has its roots in [[Samizdat aka self-publishing underground literature|self-publishing of banned materials]] which was born out of the Soviet communist movement as a form of resistance against [[Firehose of Falsehood|propaganda]].
