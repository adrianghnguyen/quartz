> Cognitive distortions are patterns of thinking that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. These distorted thought patterns can often lead to negative emotions and actions. Recognizing and addressing cognitive distortions is essential for maintaining mental well-being and improving decision-making skills.

Would it be related to [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] being turned up to the eleven?

Cognitive distortions can severely impact our [[Mental illness|mental health]]. There are multiple ways of tackling it:
- [[Cognitive behavioral therapy helps change negative thought patterns and behaviors to improve mental health|cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)]]
- [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] to help develop awareness when they arise

## Examples of cognitive distortions

>
> There are several different types of cognitive distortions, including:
>
> 1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: This distortion involves seeing things in extremes, categorizing situations as either all good or all bad, with no middle ground.
>
> 2. **Overgeneralization**: Overgeneralization occurs when an individual draws broad conclusions based on limited experiences or evidence.
>
> 3. **[[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|Catastrophizing]]**: Catastrophizing involves magnifying the significance of negative events or outcomes, assuming the worst-case scenario will always occur.
>
> 4. **Discounting the Positive**: This distortion involves dismissing or minimizing positive experiences, accomplishments, or compliments.
>
> 5. **Mental Filtering**: Mental filtering refers to selectively focusing only on negative aspects of a situation while ignoring the positive aspects.
>
> 6. **Jumping to Conclusions**: Jumping to conclusions involves making assumptions or reaching conclusions without sufficient evidence or logical reasoning.
>
> 7. **Emotional Reasoning**: Emotional reasoning occurs when an individual believes their feelings are an accurate reflection of reality, regardless of evidence to the contrary.
