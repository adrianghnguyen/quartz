> Gamma brain waves are a type of neural oscillation that occur in the brain with a frequency range of 25 to 100 Hz. They are considered one of the fastest brain wave frequencies and are associated with high-level cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and perception. Gamma waves are believed to play a crucial role in binding together different sensory inputs and integrating information across different brain regions. They have also been linked to states of peak performance, creativity, and heightened awareness. Overall, gamma brain waves reflect the synchronized activity of large populations of neurons and are an important aspect of brain function.

In the way that gamma waves seem to integrate different sensory inputs and information across different brain regions, it seems like it increases our ability for the concept of [[Unification of mind|unification of mind]].
