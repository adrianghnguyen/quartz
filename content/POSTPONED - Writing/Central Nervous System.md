All thoughts originate from the central nervous system(**CNS**, brain, spinal cord, and a **complex network of nerves**) which we can think of as the command center of our bodies. "Originating from your brain, it controls your movements, thoughts and automatic responses to the world around you. It also controls other body systems and processes, such as digestion, breathing and sexual development (puberty)."^[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21202-nervous-system]

It's what controls our [[Mind-body connection|mind-body connection]] and is further explained within the [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|dual process theory]] by Daniel Kahneman who is also the author of [[Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman|Thinking Fast and Slow]].
