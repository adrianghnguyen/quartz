# Context switching when transitioning between tasks should be avoided when possible

Context switching is switching focus from one task or activity to another. It leads that we need to mentally disengage from one set of task and transition to another.

> Context switching refers to the process of shifting focus from one task or activity to another. It involves mentally disengaging from one set of tasks and transitioning to another. Context switching can occur in various situations, such as when [[Multitasking is a myth|multitasking]] or when switching between different projects or roles. While it may seem efficient to switch between tasks quickly, context switching can actually lead to decreased productivity and increased mental fatigue.

I would also assume that it means that we need to recall the appropriate mental schemas, or make sure that we are switching over to the right one. If my assumption is right, this would involve [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]], which is a lot more deliberate and [[Working memory is limited|cognitively expensive]] on our memory. I guess it would also lead to [[Working memory is limited|information overload]].

There is a high [[Mental cost of context switching|mental cost to context switching]].
