According to Amy Edmondson, Professor of Leadership and Management at Harvard, there is a [[Cultural roots of shame|deep-rooted cultural belief]] that [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure]] is unacceptable - to fail means the negative message that there we are [[Shame resilience is recognizing shame and moving through it constructively|fundamentally flawed]], contributing to a [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|sense of shame]]. In current modern society, there is a [[Societal pressures are imposed influence and expectation by society on individuals to conform|societal image]] that success means never failing.

It's an unrealistic expectation of how we navigate daily life - and that we should understand that failure is part of the journey towards success. It's an imprtant reminder that undergoing [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transitions]] can feel difficult at times, we'll need to adapt to new change - but [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|that's okay]].

Social media, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram gives us unrealistic images of success - they are curated images. As a result, it's easy for us to learn to [[Social comparison|compare ourselves to others]]. As a result, we should be conscious of how many interactions we want to have with such platforms, which give us incomplete information about the struggles others may have. [[Social media reinforces negative self-image|Seeing the manufactured image of other people's life on social media hurts our self-esteem.]]

It's more of an anomaly to view life as a steady upward trajectory. Throughout history, the concept of failure was not seen as such a personal taboo.
