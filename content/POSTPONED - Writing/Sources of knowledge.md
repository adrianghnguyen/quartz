# Sources of knowledge and others ways we can learn

#status/postponed

Related to [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]

What are the ways by which we can learn? According to Farnham's treat and the accelerated learning philosophy, we can learn from these two methods.

We often learn most through [[History is a good teacher|indirect experience]] such as by reading what others have done/history and [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|from our own personal reflections]] of past personal experiences.

These are the most common sources of learning.

1. [[History is a good teacher|History is a good teacher and can teach us valuable things from previous things which occurred the past]].
2. [[Learn from your past experiences|Learn from your personal experiences.]]

## Strategies for learning quickly

Here are some of the techniques and strategies we can use for accelerated learning:

- Use the [[Learn anything like Feynman|Feynman technique]] to ensure [[Process information deeply to create knowledge|deep understanding about a topic]]
- Use the [[Spaced repetition is superior to rote memorization|spaced repetition]] technique to develop [[Neuroplasticity|strong neuronal activation patterns]] for memories
- [[Ultralearning by Scott Young|Ultralearning]]
- [[Continuous learning spurs personal growth]]
- [[Sources of knowledge]]
- [[Improving our memory]]
