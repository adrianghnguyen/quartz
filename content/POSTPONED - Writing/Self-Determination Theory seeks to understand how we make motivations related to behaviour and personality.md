Self-Determination Theory (SDT) explain how being self-determined impacts [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]]—that people feel more motivated to take action when they think that what they do will have an effect on the outcome.

Self-determination refers to a *person's ability to make choices and manage their own life*. Being *self-determined* means that you feel in greater control, as opposed to being non-self-determined, which can leave you feeling that your life is controlled by others.^[verywellmind.com/what-is-self-determination-theory-2795387]

## Overview of self determination theory

This meta theory, or [[Brains organize information into schemas|broad framework]] serves to try and understand why and how we act certain ways - as related to motivation. It serves to provide a holistic system to understand human motivation and personality.

The goal of the theory is to understand the following:
1. How [[Personality is shaped our environment|sociocultural factors]] undermine or facilitate people's volition, initiative, well-being and personal performance.
2. [[Traits defining great work|Conditions]] which support [[Make the future you want with personal agency|autonomy]], competence and [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|relatedness]]  offer the highest forms of motivation and engagement, as well as creativity.

### Formal definition of SDT

> [!NOTE] Overview of SDT from the horse's mouth
> People are centrally concerned with motivation — how to move themselves or others to act. Everywhere, parents, teachers, coaches, and managers struggle with how to motivate those that they mentor, and individuals struggle to find energy, mobilize effort and persist at the tasks of life and work.
>
> People are often moved by external factors such as reward systems, grades, evaluations, or the opinions they fear others might have of them. Yet, just as frequently, people are motivated from within, by interests, curiosity, care or abiding values.
>
> These intrinsic motivations are not necessarily externally rewarded or supported, but nonetheless they can sustain passions, creativity, and sustained efforts. The interplay between the extrinsic forces acting on persons and the intrinsic motives and needs inherent in human nature is the territory of Self-Determination Theory.

>
> Self-determination theory is a psychological theory that explains how humans actively pursue goals and desires to fulfill their basic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.
> It suggests that people have an innate drive towards growth, development, and personal satisfaction, and that these drives can be supported or thwarted by external factors such as social environments or cultural norms.
>
> In summary, self-determination theory proposes that individuals are motivated by the need for personal agency, accomplishment and connection with others.

## Main assumptions of the theory

1. **The need for growth drives behavior**. The first assumption of self-determination theory is that people are actively directed toward [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|personal growth]]. Gaining [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|mastery]] over challenges and taking in new experiences are essential for developing a cohesive [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|sense of self]].
2. **Intrinsic motivation is important.** While people are often motivated to act by external rewards such as [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|money, prizes, and acclaim]] (known as *extrinsic* motivation), self-determination theory focuses primarily on internal sources of motivation (intrinsic) such as a need to gain knowledge or independence.

## The three main psychological needs of self-determination theory

1. [[Make the future you want with personal agency|Personal agency]]: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
2. [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|Competence]]: the feeling that you are good at what you do
3. [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|Relatedness]]: the feeling of connection to other people

### SDT’s Six Mini-Theories

> SDT comprises six mini-theories, each of which was developed to explain a set of motivationally based phenomena that emerged from laboratory and field research. Each, therefore, addresses one facet of motivation or personality functioning.
>
> _1_**_. Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)_** concerns **_intrinsic motivation_**, motivation that is based on the satisfactions of behaving “for its own sake.”  Prototypes of intrinsic motivation are children’s exploration and play, but intrinsic motivation is a lifelong creative wellspring. CET specifically addresses the effects of social contexts on intrinsic motivation, or how factors such as rewards, interpersonal controls, and ego-involvements impact intrinsic motivation and interest. CET highlights the critical roles played by competence and autonomy supports in fostering intrinsic motivation, which is critical in education, arts, sport, and many other domains.
>
> 2. **_Organismic Integration Theory (OIT),_** the second mini-theory, addresses the topic of extrinsic motivation in its various forms, with their properties, determinants, and consequences. Broadly speaking, extrinsic motivation is behavior that is instrumental—that aims toward outcomes extrinsic to the behavior itself. Yet, there are distinct forms of instrumentality, which include external regulation, introjection, identification, and integration. These subtypes of extrinsic motivation are seen as falling along a continuum of **_internalization_**. The more internalized the extrinsic motivation, the more autonomous the person will be when enacting the behaviors. OIT is further concerned with social contexts that enhance or forestall internalization—that is, with what conduces toward people either resisting, partially adopting, or deeply internalizing values, goals, or belief systems. OIT particularly highlights supports for autonomy and relatedness as critical to internalization.
>
> _3._ **_Causality Orientations Theory (COT)_**, the third mini-theory, describes individual differences in people’s tendencies to orient toward environments and regulate behavior in various ways. COT describes and assesses three types of causality orientations: the autonomy orientation in which persons act out of interest in and valuing of what is occurring; the control orientation in which the focus is on rewards, gains, and approval; and the impersonal or amotivated orientation characterized by anxiety concerning competence.
>
> 4.  **_Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT)_** is the fourth mini-theory and elaborates the concept of evolved psychological needs and their relations to psychological health and well-being. BPNT argues that psychological well-being and optimal functioning is predicated on autonomy, competence, and relatedness.  Therefore, contexts that support versus thwart these needs should invariantly impact wellness. The theory argues that all three needs are essential and that if any is thwarted there will be distinct functional costs. Because basic needs are universal aspects of functioning, BPNT looks at cross-developmental and cross-cultural settings for validation and refinements.
>
> 5. **_Goal Contents Theory (GCT),_** the fifth mini-theory, grows out of the distinctions between intrinsic and extrinsic goals and their impact on motivation and wellness. Goals are seen as differentially affording basic need satisfactions and are thus differentially associated with well-being. Extrinsic goals such as financial success, appearance, and popularity/fame have been specifically contrasted with intrinsic goals such as community, [[Intimacy is the level of psychological closeness in a relationship|close relationships]], and personal growth, with the former more likely associated with lower wellness and greater ill-being.
>
> 6. Relatedness, which has to do with the development and maintenance of close personal relationships such as [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|best friends]] and romantic partners as well as belonging to groups, is one of the three basic psychological needs. _**Relationships Motivation Theory (RMT),** the sixth mini-theory,_ is concerned with these and other relationships, and posits that some amount of such interactions is not only desirable for most people but is in fact essential for their adjustment and well-being because the relationships provide satisfaction of the need for relatedness. However, research shows that not only is the relatedness need satisfied in high-quality relationships, but the autonomy need and to a lesser degree the competence need are also satisfied. Indeed, the highest quality personal relationships are ones in which each partner supports the autonomy, competence, and relatedness needs of the other.

## Level of self-determination shapes the experience of failure

See also [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth]].

Imagine a person who fails to complete an important project at work.

- If this person is **high** in self-determination, they will admit their fault, believe that they can do something to fix the problem, and take action to correct the mistake.
- If that same person was **low** in self-determination, they might instead look for other things that they can blame. They might make excuses, [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|blaming others]], or refuse to admit their own role in not completing the project on time.
	- Most importantly, perhaps, is that the person low in self-determination won't feel motivated to fix the mistake. Instead, they might feel helpless to control the situation and believe that nothing that they do will have any real effect.
