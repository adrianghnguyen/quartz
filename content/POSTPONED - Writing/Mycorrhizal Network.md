> A **Mycorrhizal network** (also known as a **common mycorrhizal network** or **CMN**) is an underground network found in forests and other plant communities, created by the [hyphae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypha "Hypha") of [mycorrhizal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal "Mycorrhizal") [fungi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungi "Fungi") joining with plant roots. This network connects individual plants together and transfers water, carbon, nitrogen, and other nutrients and minerals between participants.

> The formation and nature of these networks is context-dependent, and can be influenced by factors such as [soil fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_fertility "Soil fertility"), resource availability, host or myco-symbiont genotype, disturbance and seasonal variation.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycorrhizal_network#cite_note-Simard2012-6)

How interesting that they talk about context-dependency

Also talks about the source-sink model (wtf is that) as you read further along

Use [[Finding the Mother Tree by Suzanne Simard]] as a resource?
