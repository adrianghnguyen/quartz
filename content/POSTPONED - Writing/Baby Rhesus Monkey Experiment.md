This is exemplified by the Rhesus monkey experiments. I remember learning about this in my psychology classes.

> In Harry Harlow’s series of “monster mother” studies, conducted in the middle of the twentieth century, his research team invented mechanical “mothers,” to which infant rhesus monkeys attached. Once the infants were emotionally attached to the monster mothers, the mechanical devices shook the infants, spiked them, or jetted cold air onto them, to force the babies away.
>
> And what did the infant monkeys do when their “mothers” treated them badly, shook them off, rejected them?
>
> They ran back to their mothers.
>
> In an episode of the radio show This American Life, Deborah Blum, author of a biography of Harlow, Love at Goon Park, puts it this way:
>
> **The rhesus monkey babies came back and they did everything they could to make those mothers love them again. And they cooed, and they stroked, and they’d groom, and they’d flirt, and exactly what human babies do with their moms. And they would abandon their friends. They had to fix this relationship. It was so important to them.**^[Glass and Blum, “Unconditional Love Transcript.”]
