> The strength model of self-regulation is a psychological theory that suggests that self-regulation is a limited resource that can be depleted over time. This model proposes that individuals have a finite amount of mental energy or willpower, which can become depleted after exerting self-control in various tasks or situations.
>
> According to the strength model, self-regulation is like a muscle that can become fatigued with excessive use. When individuals exert self-control in one area, such as resisting temptations or making difficult decisions, their mental energy decreases, making it harder to exercise self-control in subsequent tasks.
>
> The model also suggests that factors such as stress, [[fatigue]], and distractions can further deplete an individual's self-regulatory resources. For example, if someone is already mentally exhausted from a long day at work, they may have less willpower to resist unhealthy food choices or engage in other desired behaviors.
>
> However, the strength model also proposes that individuals can replenish their self-regulatory resources through rest and recovery. Engaging in activities that promote relaxation, such as meditation or leisure activities, can help restore mental energy and enhance self-control abilities.
>
> The strength model of self-regulation has been widely studied and supported by research in various domains. It has been applied to understand behaviors related to impulse control, emotion regulation, goal pursuit, and addiction. Understanding the limitations of self-regulation can help individuals better manage their mental energy and make more effective decisions in various aspects of life.

## Decision-making is a limited resource

In response to [[Andre Paul Johnson|AP Johnson]] on 'is decision-making a fixed resource?'

> No I don't think the number of [[Making difficult decisions|good decisions]] is a fixed number.

> If i had to make a parallel, it would be the same concept application as [[Fixed mindset|fixed mindset vs growth mindset]]. What I would say though, is that [[Working memory is limited|working memory is limited]] which we've observed in neuroscience.

> Additionally, attention which uses [[Make informed decisions|good decisions]] as a proxy is a resource which can be renewed. Just like we eat food to gain physical energy, attention needs to be fed through meditation ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]]) which is essentially giving the brain resting time.
