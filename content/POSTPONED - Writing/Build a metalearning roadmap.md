# Metalearning is about developing a personal knowledge roadmap

#status/postponed

Related to [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning]]

Metalearning is about developing a personal knowledge roadmap. It's a skill in identifying our personal motivations towards the topic and subject. It's about building personal significance in [[Learn new skills through projects|learning something new through a project]] in order to make its success [[Make progress towards long-term goals|an authentic goal]]. Afterwards, it's making an informed strategy about what we wish to learn and identifying various learning approaches towards the subject.

We can develop our metalearning map with 3 specific questions:
1. Why do you want to learn it? [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|Dig deep and reflect internally.]]
2. What do you need to learn? Identify potential bottlenecks to learning such as the most difficult things to learn. You'll need to be proactive to overcome them.
3. Research how others usually learn this topic to [[Syntopical Reading is compare and contrast of multiple knowledge sources|compare and contrast]].

This may be require a certain level of [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iteration]].

## Answer why you want to learn something to make it personally meaningful

> Define **why** you want to learn that subject. Your goal or desired outcomes will determine the type of skills and knowledge you need. Try interviewing experts in the field to refine your learning plan.
>
> For example, you can speak with a successful architect to confirm if learning design skills will indeed help you to become a good architect. Don’t be afraid to reach out to experts via social media, email or other channels: many of them will be willing to do a 15 minute phone/video call to help you.

## Identify the concepts you need to learn

> - Once know your “why”, you can figure out **what** you must learn.
>
> (i) On a piece of paper, create 3 columns labelled: concepts, facts, and procedures. *Concepts* are the ideas you must understand (e.g. to learn math, you must grasp concepts like equality and symbolic representation).  *Facts* are the things that you must memorize (e.g. languages involve vocabulary, pronunciation and grammar). *Procedures* are the actions that must be practiced.
>
> (ii) Identify your bottlenecks, i.e. the concepts, facts and procedures that are the hardest for you. Research the tools/methods to help you tackle those bottlenecks, so you have a more realistic learning map.
>

## Research learning strategies for the subject or topic

- Figure out how people typically learn the subject and what content is covered
- Modify the curriculum based on your needs
- Review your learning path as needed based on progress and diminishing returns.

> To figure out **how** to learn what’s required:
>
> (i) Benchmark how people typically learn that subject. For example, you can research how it’s usually taught in schools or universities, examine the topics in textbooks, or course syllabi found on websites.
>
> (ii) Modify the default curriculum, by emphasizing or excluding certain topics to suit your personal needs/preferences. For example, if you’re learning French because you’re going to Paris in 2 weeks, you’d want to focus more on pronunciation than spelling.
>
> As a **rule of thumb**, invest about 10% of your expected learning time into the initial research and planning. Then, regularly review your progress to see if diminishing returns have set in. If so, pause to research new tools/techniques.
