> [!ai]+ AI
> **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)** is a mental health condition that occurs in individuals who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event. It can develop after exposure to various types of trauma, such as combat, natural disasters, serious accidents, physical or sexual assault, or terrorist attacks.
>
> People with PTSD often re-experience the traumatic event through distressing memories, nightmares, or flashbacks. They may also try to avoid reminders of the event and experience negative changes in mood and thinking, such as feeling detached, [[Distractions and difficulty concentrating]], or a persistently negative outlook. Additionally, individuals with PTSD may manifest heightened arousal symptoms, including irritability, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbances.


> According to modern understandings of post-traumatic stress, memories and emotions from trauma are often stored in the body.
