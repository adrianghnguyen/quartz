# Recurse center

#status/postponed 

---

This is a place that was introduced to me by [[Tim Vieregge]]. He went through the process with them and he felt like it was a very cool, self-directed programming retreat. 

It's different from a bootcamp because it's all self-directed, but it's about putting yourself in an environment where you can really grow your skill sets. And that's maybe something worth considering, right? In the meantime, I can figure a bit more. 

Their next batch, I think, which fits into my schedule, is between March 25th and June 28th on Spring 2, 2024.
