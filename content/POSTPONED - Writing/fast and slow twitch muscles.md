## What are fast and slow twitch muscles?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Fast and slow twitch muscles refer to the two main types of muscle fibers found in the human body.
> Fast twitch muscles, also known as type II fibers, are responsible for generating short bursts of high-intensity power and speed. These fibers contract quickly but tire out easily, making them ideal for activities that require explosive movements such as sprinting or weightlifting.
> Slow twitch muscles, also known as type I fibers, are designed for endurance and sustained activity. These fibers contract more slowly but can maintain their effort for longer periods of time without fatigue. Activities such as distance running or cycling rely heavily on slow-twitch muscle fibers.
> The proportion of fast and slow twitch muscle fibers in an individual's body can vary depending on genetics and training. Some athletes may have a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers, while others may have more slow-twitch fibers. Training can help improve the efficiency and strength of both types of muscle fibers.
