## What is the concept of a super organism?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The superorganism concept is a biological concept that describes the behavior of certain organisms when they work together as a unit, functioning like a single organism. This idea was first proposed by biologist William Morton Wheeler in 1911 and has been applied to various species, including ants, bees, termites, and humans.
>
> In a superorganism, individual members have specialized roles and work together to achieve a common goal. For example, in an ant colony, there are worker ants that gather food and care for the young, soldier ants that defend the colony from predators, and queen ants that lay eggs. Together, they form a cohesive unit that can thrive in their environment.
>
> The superorganism concept has also been applied to human societies. In this context, society is viewed as an organized system with specialized roles and functions. Individuals work together to achieve common goals such as economic prosperity or social harmony.
>
> Overall, the superorganism concept helps us understand how organisms can function as a collective entity with complex behaviors and interactions.

## Superorganism

This concept seems to relate how the environment also shapes the individual units. It seems very similar to the concept of [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organization]]

> With the recognition that the insect colony is a functional unit in the same sense that an organism is, the concept of the superorganism has reemerged.
>
> This concept suggests that the social insect colony is organized on several levels, each subject to natural selection. Just as mechanisms evolved to integrate the parts of the individual ant into a whole functioning organism, so have mechanisms evolved to integrate the individual ants into a functioning superorganism, capable of drawing resources from the environment, regulating internal (colony) functions and responding to stresses.

> In this light, the nest and its architecture are almost certainly not simply shelter, but are such a mechanism of integration.
>
> To modify the ideas of Turner (2000) slightly, the nest is part of the extended superorganism. The natural nest architecture probably structures the colony within it, and organizes its functions, much as the architecture of a factory building organizes the labor force within it.
