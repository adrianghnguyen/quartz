> Continuous feedback is a process of providing ongoing and regular feedback to employees or individuals. It involves timely and constructive feedback to help improve performance and achieve goals. Continuous feedback can be given by managers, peers, or even through self-reflection. It focuses on specific behaviors, actions, or outcomes and helps in identifying strengths and areas of improvement. This approach encourages a growth mindset and promotes continuous learning and development.
