# Research on money and happiness

Related to [[Money can only lower unhappiness]]

## Money can improve life evaluation but not necessarily happiness

- Life evaluation refers to the thoughts of people have when they think about their lives.
	- It's our general life satisfaction.
- Emotional well-being refers to emotional quality of our everyday experience.
	- This refers to the frequency and intensity of our experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger and affection, which makes our relief pleasant or unpleasant.

> [!NOTE]- Research shows that money improves life satisfaction but not necessarily happiness
> Recent research has begun to distinguish two aspects of subjective well-being.
>
> Emotional well-being refers to the emotional quality of an individual's everyday experience—the frequency and intensity of experiences of joy, stress, sadness, anger, and affection that make one's life pleasant or unpleasant.
>
> Life evaluation refers to the thoughts that people have about their life when they think about it. We raise the question of whether money buys happiness, separately for these two aspects of well-being. We report an analysis of more than 450,000 responses to the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily survey of 1,000 US residents conducted by the Gallup Organization.
>
> We find that emotional well-being (measured by questions about emotional experiences yesterday) and life evaluation (measured by Cantril's Self-Anchoring Scale) have different correlates. Income and education are more closely related to life evaluation, but health, care giving, loneliness, and smoking are relatively stronger predictors of daily emotions. When plotted against log income, life evaluation rises steadily.
>
> Emotional well-being also rises with log income, but there is no further progress beyond an annual income of ~$75,000. Low income exacerbates the [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering]] associated with such misfortunes as divorce, ill health, and being alone. We conclude that high income buys life satisfaction but not happiness, and that low income is associated both with low life evaluation and low emotional well-being.

## Prosocial spending and buying time to create happiness

How we use money matters. We should spend it wisely on buying happiness which means spending it on others called pro-social spending or buying time to spend with our loved ones called buying time.

> [!NOTE] How we use money matters - use it on buying happiness
> Researchers have long been interested in the relationship between income and happiness, but a newer wave of work suggests that how people _use_ their money also matters. We discuss the three primary areas in which psychologists have explored the relationship between spending decisions and subjective well-being, beginning with a brief review of seminal research on the benefits of buying experiences.
>
> We then offer an in-depth review of two other domains in which changes in spending decisions have been shown to increase well-being: using money to benefit others (prosocial spending) and giving up money to have more time (buying time).
>
> We discuss how, when, and why prosocial spending and buying time promote happiness. In doing so, we critically consider the evidentiary value of past findings (particularly our own) and provide links to all of our available data, as well as practical recommendations about how to replicate our findings (e.g., which measures and manipulations produce the most consistent results).
>
> Taken together, our studies on prosocial spending and buying time underscore the value of conceptualizing money not only as a stable life circumstance, but also as a tool that individuals can intentionally utilize to alter their own happiness levels.
