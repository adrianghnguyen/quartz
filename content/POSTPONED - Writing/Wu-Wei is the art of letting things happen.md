## Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happens

> The Taoists believe that, despite societal emphasis on human effort, hard work is often unnecessary.
>
> The world follows its own course, and human attempts at control prove futile. Forcing things usually leads to negative outcomes, while situations often resolve naturally without forced intervention. Wu-Wei is about aligning our actions with the natural flow of events and invoking action only when it is suitable.

According to Taoist philosophy, we should embrace the approach of Wu-Wei when it comes to life. It has many interpretations but it can refer to the following concepts: non-action, effortless action and letting things happen. I believe that taking this philosophy towards [[Understanding the complexity of life|life]] will bring us happiness by learning to [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|let go of attachment and expectations]]. It's similar to the [[Slow-life strategy is prioritizing quality and simplicity|slow life strategy]] and a [[Growth mindset|growth mindset]].

[[The marshmallow experiment showcases that delayed gratification leads to better life outcomes|The marshmallow experiment showcases that delayed gratification leads to better life outcomes]] so it can be worth it [[Being patient leads to better decisions|practicing patience.]] Once we stop caring, results will come according to the law of reverse effect.

Within this [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]], it views [[Develop better strategies over brute forcing|hard work as often unnecessary]] and perhaps a source of [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|human suffering]]. We should be adaptable and [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|approach life with acceptance]] and only invoke action when it is suitable. Forcing actions often provide us with negative outcomes, possibly leading to [[Disappointment stems from unmet expectations|disappointment from unmet expectations]].

We should navigate through life like water flowing through rocks and [[Everything in moderation|avoiding extremes]]. Embrace the natural state of the world as it goes. [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|Amor fati.]]

For example, when it comes to people, the [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|ones who are worth keeping around]] will come back to us if it was meant to be.

This error highlights the importance of working in conjunction with nature, supporting the Taoist philosophy of Wu-Wei, a term which has various interpretations such as "non-action", "effortless action", and "letting things happen".

> Wu-Wei encompasses not only letting events happen but also removing personal ego and resisting the urge to control outcomes. This involves navigating through life like water flowing through rocks, accepting things as they are, and [[Everything in moderation|avoiding extremes]]. The ultimate interpretation of Wu-Wei is "effortless action", which means being active and in motion but letting things natures take its course.

> It addresses that [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|overthinking]] and over-preparation often obstruct the natural flow and can lead to negative outcomes, while spontaneous and in-the-moment behaviors can be more positively received. The philosophy also includes the concept of returning to an "uncarved block" - a state undistorted by ego or intellectual baggage, providing a clearer view of the world.

> In essence, Wu-Wei beneath all its interpretations is about having a receptive and responsive way of action, unencumbered by preconceptions, and being one with the natural rhythm of the cosmos.

## Wu-wei is about aligning our actions with reality

> _Wu wei_ is closely connected to the Daoist reverence for the natural world, for it means striving to make our behaviour as spontaneous and inevitable as certain natural processes, and to ensure that we are swimming with rather than against currents. 
> 
> We are to be like the bamboo that bends in the wind or the plant that adjusts itself to the shape of a tree. _Wu wei_ involves letting go of ideals that we may otherwise try to force too violently onto things; it invites us instead to respond to the true demands of situations, which tend only to be noticed when we put our own ego-driven plans aside. What can follow is a loss of self-consciousness, a new unity between the self and its environment, which releases an energy that is normally held back by an overly aggressive, wilful style of thinking.

It does not mean to be lazy, slothful or to give up. Wu-wei is rather about adapting our selves to the world as is necessary without forcing our preconceived notions, perhaps coming from our past. Personal growth is achieved in humility and recognizing that [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|we may have been wrong]] so adaptation of action is needed.
