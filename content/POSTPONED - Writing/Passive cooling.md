## Human energy consumption will keep increasing over the years

As our population grows, humanity will have increasing needs for multiple reasons
1. Our CO2 emissions will lead to an increase in climate change including cold and heat waves
2. We have a growing population expecting to hit 10 billion in the next decades.
3. A lot of our technology relies on electricity.

As a result, it is important to find sustainable, renewable energy sources. In addition to active consumption, we should be looking at ways we can reduce the energy consumption. It should be a multi-pronged approach. Similar to recycling the primary step should be reducing the source in the first place rather than using band-aid approaches. Fix the [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|root causes]] of energy consumption and global emissions.
