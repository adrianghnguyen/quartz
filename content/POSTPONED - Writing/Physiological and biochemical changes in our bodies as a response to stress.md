# Physiological and biochemical changes in our bodies as a response to stress

#status/postponed

Related to [[Freeze Fight or Flight Response to danger]]

When our brains perceive a threat within the environment, we might experience massive biochemical changes and physiological reactions.

- Massive biochemical changes
	- Adrenaline surge
	- Release of [[Cortisol is the stress hormone|cortisol]] in bloodstream
- Physiological events and response
	- Increased heart rate (relationship to [[HRV Frequency Measurements]]?)
	- Increased respiration rate
	- Increased blood pressure
	- Suppressed immune functioning
	- Suppressed digestive functioning i.e. loss of appetite
	- Dilation of pupils
	- Change of attention to vigilance - we become more alert to possible present threats

[[Cortisol is the stress hormone]]
