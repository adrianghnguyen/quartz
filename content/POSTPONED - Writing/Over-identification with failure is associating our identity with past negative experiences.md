## Over-identification with failure

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Over-identification with failure is a psychological phenomenon where an [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|individual excessively associates themselves]] with their past failures or negative experiences. It occurs when a person's [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]] and self-worth become heavily influenced by their perceived shortcomings and setbacks.
>
> When someone over-identifies with [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure]], they may constantly dwell on past mistakes, replaying them in their mind and feeling a [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|deep sense of shame]] or [[Guilt is a feeling of remorse over our actions|guilt]]. They may believe that these failures define who they are as a person and struggle to separate themselves from these negative experiences.
>
> This mindset can have detrimental effects on one's mental health and overall well-being. Over-identifying with failure can lead to feelings of hopelessness, low self-esteem, and a lack of confidence. It may also prevent individuals from [[Approach life with an entrepreneurial mindset|taking risks]] or pursuing new opportunities due to fear of repeating past failures.
>
> There are several factors that can contribute to over-identification with failure. These include [[perfectionism]], fear of judgment or rejection, a history of [[Trauma is involuntary loss of control|trauma]] or abuse, and a lack of [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|healthy coping mechanisms]]. Additionally, [[Societal pressures are imposed influence and expectation by society on individuals to conform|societal pressures]] and unrealistic expectations can also play a role in exacerbating this phenomenon.
>
> In order to overcome over-identification with failure, it is important for individuals to develop self-compassion and practice self-forgiveness. This involves recognizing that everyone makes mistakes and that failures do not define one's worth as a person. Seeking support from friends, family, or professionals such as therapists can also be beneficial in working through these [[Cognitive distortions|negative thought patterns]].
>
> By challenging [[Dealing with our inner critic|negative self-talk]] and [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|reframing failures as opportunities for growth and learning]], individuals can gradually break free from the cycle of over-identification with failure. It is important to remember that setbacks are a [[Understanding the complexity of life|normal part of life]] and do not determine one's future success or happiness.

> Its opposite is over-identification, as in over-identifying with your own failures and suffering, holding fast to the pain and being unable to let it go. It’s assessed with items like “When I’m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that’s wrong.”

Would it be similar to overfitting? I think this is a trait of [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict people]] - they make it seem as if the entire world is out to get them.

## Dwelling on the past

There is a time and place to think about the past, perhaps it's learning to make peace with it so we can move on. However, it can become destructive at times to constantly live in [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]]. [[Make quick and decisive actions|There is a time and place for action]] which can give us the opportunity to restore a [[Make the future you want with personal agency|sense of personal control]].

Even though a minor action may not mean much in the grand scheme of things, it's learning to move on from [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|overidentification with failure]]. Setting small goals and building small habits can help me get out of a deep funk and help me [[Getting unstuck -  How Dead Ends Become New Paths by Timothy Butler|get unstuck]].

It can be easy to dwell on the past as things seem gloom and pessimistic. In those times, it's perhaps worth remembering to [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|Use the Hope Circuit to fight deep human instincts of pessimism and helplessness.]]
