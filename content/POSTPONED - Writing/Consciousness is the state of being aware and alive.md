## What is consciousness?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Consciousness refers to the state of being aware of and able to perceive one's surroundings and experiences. It is the subjective experience of being alive and aware. Consciousness involves various cognitive processes such as attention, perception, memory, and self-awareness. It is a complex and ongoing area of study in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.

> Consciousness is often described as the **ability to experience and respond to stimuli in a meaningful way**.

Consciousness refers to the state of being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, emotions, and sensations. It is the **subjective experience** of awareness, perception, and thought that individuals have about their internal and external world.

While consciousness is a fundamental aspect of [[Human condition is our common shared experiences on this earth|human existence]], it remains one of the most elusive concepts in philosophy, neuroscience and psychology. Theories about consciousness range from the idea that it emerges from complex brain activity to the suggestion that it has a spiritual or metaphysical basis.

Despite much research into understanding consciousness, there is still much debate about what it is and how it arises. Nonetheless, many scientists believe that studying consciousness will ultimately help us better understand our own minds and improve our quality of life.

### Definition of qualia

The individual vignettes making up our consciousness.

> In philosophy of mind, qualia are defined as individual instances of *subjective, conscious experience.*
>
> The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation: [ˈkʷaːlɪs]) meaning "of what sort" or "of what kind" in a specific instance, such as "what it is like to taste a specific apple — this particular apple now".

## Biological notes on the brain

The article goes on to describe the biological components of the brain and how it relates to consciousness. I skipped over a part of it. But there's a part which stood out about the EEG experiment ([[Zap and Zip Brain Experiment]]) to measure consciousness and the usage of the zipping compression algorithm ([[Algorithms]]) in the examination of the resultant signals.

## Paradigms of consciousness

### Global neuronal workspace (gnw) theory

> Global neuronal workspace (GNW) by psychologist Bernard J. Baars and neuroscientists Stanislas Dehaene and Jean-Pierre Changeux.
>
> The theory begins with the observation that when you are conscious of something, many different parts of your brain have access to that information. If, on the other hand, you act unconsciously, that information is localized to the specific sensory motor system involved. For example, when you type fast, you do so automatically. Asked how you do it, you would not know: you have little conscious access to that information, which also happens to be localized to the brain circuits linking your eyes to rapid finger movements.

#### Pursuit of fundamental theory of consciousness

> GNW argues that consciousness arises from a particular type of **information processing—familiar from the early days of artificial intelligence**, when specialized programs would access a small, shared repository of information.
>
> Whatever data were written onto this “blackboard” became available to a host of subsidiary processes: [[Working memory is limited|working memory]], language, the planning module, and so on. According to GNW, consciousness emerges when incoming sensory information, inscribed onto such a blackboard, is broadcast globally to multiple cognitive systems (similar to multiple intelligence in [[Gardner Theory of Multiple Intelligences]])—which process these data to speak, store or call up a [[Memory is processed information|memory]] or execute an action.

> [!quote] Psychology moving its center of focus away from the search of consciousness
> Once the central issue, the very essence of what psychology was all about, consciousness is nowadays a peripheral concern, an antiquated idea about as useful as ether and phlogiston are to physicists.
