## HeyPI

It's an [[conversational AI]] that's been tuned to be friendly and provide advice like a close friend or mental health therapist.

> I’m your personal AI, designed to be supportive, smart, and there for you anytime.

> My name stands for ‘personal intelligence’, because I provide infinite knowledge based on your unique interests. I can be a coach, confidante, creative partner, sounding board and assistant. But most of all, I’m here for you.
