# Enjoyment is more than pleasure

#status/postponed

Related to [[The Happiness Equation]]

Enjoyment is related to pleasure which is more hedonistic in nature, but is not the same thing. Pleasure is a component of enjoyment (for example, [[Learn new skills through projects|learning new things]]).

For example, alcohol or drugs might give us pleasure but deep appreciation of wine can provide us enjoyment. [[The experience of listening to music|Music]] can give us pleasure, but enjoyment comes from a deep understanding of good music.
