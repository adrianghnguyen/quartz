## Myth of motivation

[The Myth of Motivation | Psychology Today Canada](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-addiction-connection/201708/the-myth-of-motivation)


> - Committed action comes first and motivation comes second.
> - Committed actions are consistent with a person's values, or who they want to be.
> - The mind never stops offering its objections to action, which means taking action can seem impossible until one actually does it.
