# Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence due to mastery

#status/postponed

---

Flow state is when we are able to enter unconscious competence through having repeated a skill enough times via [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]]. It can also be called robot mode.^[Funny enough, [[My love letter to StarCraft|Flash's nickname]] was the Terminator, a humanoid robot. *Beep boop.*]  Flow can also be known as *effortless effort*.

Here are some of the markers which can help us identify flow state:

Some markers are lost to one's perception of time such as a freeze-frame effect, complete focus and engagement, intuition (see also [[The Power of Intuition by Gary Klein]]) becomes sharpened, rapt attention and total absorption.

- Some markers are lost to one's perception of time
- Freeze-frame effect
- Complete focus and engagement
- Intuition (see also [[The Power of Intuition by Gary Klein]]) becomes sharpened
- Rapt attention
- Total absorption
- Part of the essence of pleasure
- Permeates all aspects of our lives
- *Optimal experiences*

This ability to focus has allowed humanity - artists, scientists, athletes - to achieve great accomplishments as a result of their extended commitment on a narrow field. "Since any scientific, artistic, or other creative effort depends on acquiring, recombining, or producing information, and since this process requires attention that is in limited supply, concentration must be the inevitable prerequisite of creative work."^[p.9 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15>]

## Flow state allows the highest enjoyment of pleasurable experiences

To truly enjoy pleasurable experiences in a conscious manner, one needs to enter this state of flow - intense focused attention or "concentration" on a **narrow range of stimuli**^[p.7 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15>]

It is part of the essence of pleasure and permeates all aspect of our lives - optimal experiences.

> [!quote] To experience flow is to be truly alive
> If attention is the means by which a person exchanges information with the environment, and when this process is voluntary—that is, under the person’s control—then voluntary focusing of attention is a state of optimal interaction. In such a state a person feels fully alive and in control, because he or she can direct the flow of reciprocal information that unites person and environment in an interactive system.
>
> **I know that I am alive, that I am somebody, that I matter, when I can choose to interact** with a system of stimuli that I can modify and from which I can get meaningful feedback, whether the system is made up of other people, musical notes, ideas, or tools.
>
> The ability to focus attention is the most basic way of reducing ontological anxiety, the fear of impotence, of nonexistence. This might be the main reason why the exercise of concentration, when it is subjectively interpreted to be free, is such an enjoyable experience.
>
> \- p.8 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15>

- Makes us feel alive and able to exercise our will to interact with the environment - masters of our destiny
- Positive evolutionary survival value by allowing us to concentrate and is associated with pleasurable experience such as sex and eating
	- An organism who can process unstructured information (related to [[Data Engineering]]?) in and can enjoy the process would be beneficial for the survival of the tribe - seeking out novel sources of information.
- Allows us to achieve extraordinary things - as it often requires us to have deep discipline and commitment to learn and apply which flow permits us to do to [[How Experts Figure What to Focus On|narrow on a specific subject]].
- The results seem to indicate that someone who is paying more attention to a task will derive more pleasure from it - feeling more creative, free, and alert

## Management of attention

> Subjectively valued experiences depend on the voluntary focusing of attention on a limited stimulus field.

With this in mind, it makes sense as to why [[Meditation is the practice of mindfulness|meditation]] can allow us to enter flow states more easily. As we focus our breathing, or other source of information, we can [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberately practice]] ([[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]) the ability to narrow down our attention to specific stimuli.

> What fellows from this conclusion is that one of the major tasks in the development of human resources is the management of attention. If people are to lead a satisfying life and if society is to progress, we have to make sure that from childhood on persons will have a chance to develop their ability to concentrate.
> …
> Even when the opportunities are present—and to a certain extent they are always potentially present—most people do not know how to concentrate except under the most favorable circumstances, and so rarely experience the enjoyment that  accompanies the flow experience.
> ^[p.9 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15>]

If the experience of flow is related to one's ability to concentrate, it would make sense as to why those who are able to pursue mastery would become gifted ([[Theories of creativity and motivation]]) - the result of the labour of their efforts over a long span of time ([[Talent is dedication by few]]).

### Papillary fixation points

> Papillary fixation points are important for maintaining proper cardiac function, as they help to ensure that blood flows through the heart in the correct direction. Dysfunction of the papillary muscles or the chordae tendineae can lead to heart valve disorders such as mitral valve prolapse, which can result in symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest pain.^[ChatGPT]

### Origin of the flow theory

This was a theory initially popularized in [[Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]] - the godfather of flow theory.

Based on the finding by [[Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi|Mihaly]], who focused his research on well-being and the [[Man's Search For Meaning by Viktor E Frankl|meaning of life]], he discovered that time spent in the flow state leads to  [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|greater life satisfaction]] - this is a held finding across cultures across the world.

- [Flow State explained by Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/articles/flow-state)

It's easier to access flow state when we train our brains ([[Neuroplasticity]]) through the practice of meditation ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]]).

> [!quote] The consciousness of the flow state, as said by Steven Kotler
> Every action taken, every decision I make seems to flow effortlessly, perfectly, seamlessly. You are so focused on the task at hand, so focused on what you're doing, everything else just seems to disappear.

### Examples and indicators of flow state - what does it look like?

> [!NOTE] Examples of peak experiences
> ![[Pasted image 20230224200135.png|600]]
> \- p.7 Csikszentmihalyi, M., Abuhamdeh, S., Nakamura, J. (2014). Flow. In: Flow and the Foundations of Positive Psychology. Springer, Dordrecht. <https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-9088-8_15>

One of the indicators is our frowning muscles seem to paralyze - possibly as a result of engagement of our neo frontal cortex - one of our core decision center.

For example, when we are in love and completely focused on someone, this is a flow state. Perhaps that's why [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being grateful]] towards others ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]) can allow us to achieve this flow state when we spend time with our loved ones.^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znwUCNrjpD4]I also have a tangential article highlighting why quality relationships are the key to a good life [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|satisfaction]] which may help explain why [[Be appreciative and grateful as a life philosophy|being grateful]] is so important because it increases our ability to love.

### Flow state may lead to an inner voice of guidance

Flow state may lead to an inner voice of guidance which provides instructions.

> [!quote] One's inner voice as guidance
> Athletes talk about this thing called 'the voice' which directs their actions. The voice will tell them "right, left, do this, do that", and it's very quick. You either do what the voice is telling you to do or you tend to crash.^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znwUCNrjpD4]

- In [[Dune by Frank Herbert]], the Honored Matres and Gene Besserit are able to command others with 'the voice'. Is this where Herbert drew inspiration?
- In Gundam Seed and Seed Mode seems likes an enhanced version of flow state with the effects of time dilation. Kira Yamato bullshit lol.

## Challenge-skills equilibrium

![[Pasted image 20230205183444.png|400]]

It's also known as the "Golden Rule to flow".

Challenges should seek to be slightly above our [[Humans are motivated to grow|capabilities]] inducing a bit of stress while not being over-exceeding, causing anxiety. Too little and one will begin to feel boredom as a result of being unchallenged. Interestingly enough, boredom can also be a [[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism|method of risk avoidance]], a poor coping strategy. In other words, the environmental demands should match one's capacity for action - leading to deep concentration.

To become good at something, we need to get comfortable with being uncomfortable ([[View challenges as opportunities]]). One of my [[My core values define what matters|core values]] is self-improvement, growth and excellence through [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate practice]].

- Practicing minimalism allows us to focus on tasks ([[Remove distractions through minimalism]])

## What are the benefits of flow state?

- Enhances pattern recognition
- Enhances well-being by bolstering position emotion and mitigating [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|negative emotions]] and makes uncertain waiting periods more bearable^[Rankin, K., Walsh, L. C., & Sweeny, K. (2019). A better distraction: Exploring the benefits of flow during uncertain waiting periods. Emotion, 19(5), 818.]

Since curiosity is an innate [[Flow Triggers|trigger]] to the flow state, maintaining, this curiosity helps us discover more about the world ([[Personality is shaped our environment]]). It can also help us develop better [[Develop situational awareness to understand the environment|situational awareness]] ([[OODA Loop]], [[Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.]]).  [[Transform information into knowledge|Learning]] is important because it allows us to re-evaluate our [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|conceptual models]] which in turn allows us to adapt through the process of [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|conceptual change]] [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]] and allows us to imagine the [[Growth mindset|possibilities]].

## Theories related to flow

### Anxiety and stress as blockers to flow state

There are studies identifying the with anxiety disrupting the mechanisms of the neo frontal cortex ([[Decision making is negatively impacted by poor mental health]]) which seems to be a key player in our ability to enter the flow state.

- Relationship to the inner critic voice? [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud]][[Let negative thoughts flow by with free attention]]
	- When we are able to silence or befriend it - it allows us to unlock creativity? See [[Neuroticism]] and the mental-noise hypothesis. If we are able to silence the mental noise, the [[Associative memory connects unrelated items]] powers become unlocked? The double-edged sword of neuroticism? Are those who are able to adapt to high anxiety able to harness this for flow states based on the graphs within the challenge-skill curve?

### Energy toll of flow state on the body

Does entering a flow state consume resources or energy? Perhaps it's explained by the [[Theory of Neural Efficiency|theory of neural efficiency]] where one would consume more glucose in flow state. Maybe it's why we can only sustain this mode for a limited period of time. Maybe explained more in [[Deep Work by Cal Newport]]?

### Relationship between intrinsic motivation driving natural fluency in flow state

> [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|Intrinsic motivation]] refers to people’s spontaneous tendencies to be curious and interested, to seek out challenges and to exercise and develop their skills and knowledge, even in the absence of operationally separable rewards. Over the past four decades, experimental and field research guided by [[Humans are motivated to grow|self-determination theory]] (SDT; Ryan and Deci, 2017) has found [[Intrinsic motivation is superior to extrinsic rewards|intrinsic motivation]] to predict enhanced learning, performance, creativity, optimal development and psychological wellness. Only recently, however, have studies begun to examine the neurobiological substrates of intrinsic motivation.^[Di Domenico, S. I., & Ryan, R. M. (2017). The emerging neuroscience of intrinsic motivation: A new frontier in self-determination research. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 11, 145.]

There is a link between dopamine and intrinsic motivation as explained by self-determination theory ([[Humans are motivated to grow]]). We use to think dopamine was a reward system but it turns out it's a **motivational factor**.

## What is the relationship between the flow state and the prefrontal cortex?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The flow state, also known as being "in the zone," is a mental state in which a person is fully immersed and engaged in an activity, feeling energized and focused. The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, plays a crucial role in achieving this state.
> During flow, the prefrontal cortex is subdued, allowing other areas of the brain to take over and perform at their highest level. This means that self-consciousness and self-doubt are reduced, giving way to a sense of effortless action.
> Research has shown that those who regularly experience flow have greater activity in the prefrontal cortex during non-flow states. This suggests that individuals who are able to enter flow more easily may have stronger prefrontal cortex function overall.
> Overall, the relationship between flow and the prefrontal cortex highlights the importance of being able to quiet our inner critic and allow ourselves to fully engage in our activities.
