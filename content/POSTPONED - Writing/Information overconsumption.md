# Focus on high quality information over quantity to avoid information overload

## What is information overconsumption?

> [!quote] Information overconsumption
> Information overload means somehow managing the intake of vast quantities of information in new and more efficient ways. Information overconsumption means we need to find new ways to be selective about our intake. It is very difficult, for example, to overconsume vegetables.

## Personal reflections on information overconsumption

> “To thrive amid unprecedented amounts of novelty, we must shift from being mere seekers of the new to being connoisseurs of it.”
> \- Winifred Gallagher

There is a book called *The Information Diet* which talks that we need to be selective in what information ([[Transform information into knowledge]]) we consume and to prioritize high quality sources.

One way is to get rid of social media ([[Digital minimalism]]) and minimizing distractions ([[Remove distractions through minimalism]]). They present the fact that ingesting bad information is akin to junk food.

It's also a type of conceptual change ([[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time]]) as it requires a shift in mindset that not learning everything is good for you.

It's easy as writing in Obsidian allows me to collect information ([[Why I write in Obsidian]]) but to not fall prey to the collector's fallacy. What is truly important? Does it have value to me? Decide what brings value to my life ([[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet]]).
