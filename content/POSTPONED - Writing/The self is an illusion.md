According to Sam Harris^[ [What is the ‘self’? The 3 layers of your identity. | Sam Harris, Mark Epstein & more | Big Think - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0TzeH6Zmog)], the self is but an illusion, of [[Concepts of the self as said by Freud|ego]] seeking to take form. I'm inclined to agree - we are a gestalt of our actions, thoughts and behaviours within the world. As a result, there is no fixed, unchanging "I" within our brains but rather a dynamic and [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|ever-changing process]] which is constantly evolving in response to our life's journey.

## Anatta is recognizing that we are a result of five aggregates

According to [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula|What the Buddha Taught]], this is something also a shared view - the belief of a permanent  self leads to personal attachment and desired which leads to [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|nature of suffering (dukkha)]]. We can understand it through the [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]] of the "anatta" or "anatman," which means "not-self" or "no-soul."

> The Buddha taught that what we think of as our self is actually a collection of five aggregates (skandhas): form (physical body), feelings, perceptions, mental formations (thoughts and intentions), and consciousness. These aggregates are constantly changing due to their interaction with each other and the world.

In terms of applying it to daily life, there are some core principles:
1. Practicing [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] to learn to be aware of the present moment, the [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|changing nature]] of our emotions and thoughts
2. Letting go of strong identifications such as possessions, views, personality traits (including [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]]?) and [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|worldly status]]
3. Having a sense of non-attachment to outcomes by understanding that clinging onto things or ideas is the [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|root of human suffering]]
4. Reflect on personal experiences and how it applies to our five aggregates of the self and how they are constantly evolving
5. Live [[Living a noble life according to Buddhism|ethically]] in order to have no regrets and a clean mind.
