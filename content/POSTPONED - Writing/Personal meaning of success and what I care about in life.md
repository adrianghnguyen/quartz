## Personal meaning of success and what I care about in life

What do I find important in the world? About what I want to do? Think also about what [[Career capital|career capital]] I need to get there.

1. Discover how we think, how I think aka [[Metacognition is thinking about thinking|metacognition]]
	1. Relationship to [[Neural Network]]?
	2. [[Thoughts on the AlphaGo documentary]]
2. Take care of the world and my connections to it ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]])
	1. Take care of the environment how I can because our surroundings affect us ([[Personality is shaped our environment]])
	2. It's how my [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|dad]] would've lived ([[Personal reflections on my childhood]])
	3. [[Love is shown through actions]] - and I wish to give back
	4. It gives purpose and a sense of legacy ([[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments]], [[Find your niche]],[[Curiosity as my worldview]])
3. Surround myself with people who bring me value and remove those who don't
	1. Within my happiness checklist ([[Happiness requires action]]), I identify value as what helps me feel connected to thoughts or the world
	2. Those who detract value tend to be [[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around|high conflict people]] ([[High conflict people are unpleasant people to be around]]) or people who I find unstimulating and don't share traits of ([[Curiosity as my worldview]]). They are resistant to new ideas or don't help me generate new ones. Based on flow psychology ([[Curiosity as my worldview]], [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence]]), I now realize that if they don't engage my interest, then perhaps keep them further at bay.
	3. Be careful to let this become arrogance. I am starting to relate to the concept of HIP ([[Geniuses and divergent thinking]] as presented by [[La Douance -  Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et Créatif by Marianne Belanger]] but recognize that even if this is true - having HIP is an attribute and not a qualifier. Remember to honour my connections ([[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy]]) and let them go with grace if I realize that our paths are going to diverge. I can reflect on this by sitting with my thoughts and seeing where they settle ([[Mindfulness is presence in the moment]])
4. Discover new experiences ([[Curiosity as my worldview]])
	1. It stimulates new thoughts
	2. It's fun to think about why things are the way they are ([[Why I write in Obsidian]])
	3. Develop new competencies ([[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]) because I believe mastery ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]) is the key to [[Happiness requires action|happiness]] in life.
		1. How do I determine what's important though? I guess I'm doing it right now by reviewing the Warren buffet ([[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet]]) article ([[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet]])
		2. [[Learn new skills through projects]]
5. Prioritize [[Our environment shapes our behaviour|habits]] and success in regards to these goals
	1. [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences]]
	2. [[Grow by practicing gratefulness towards tasks and behaviors]]
	3. [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice]]
	4. Realize it takes a long time to achieve these.
		1. [[Grit by Angela Duckworth]]
		2. [[Success requires time and patience]]
		3. Finding from [[La Douance -  Comprendre Le Haut Potential Intellectuel Et Créatif by Marianne Belanger]] and how potential needs to be converted into talent ([[Inputs are transformed into outputs]])
