## What is inertia?

> [!ai]+ AI

> Inertia is the tendency of an object to resist any change in its motion. It is a property of matter that explains why objects at rest tend to stay at rest, and objects in motion tend to continue moving in a straight line at a constant speed unless acted upon by an external force. Inertia is related to an object's mass, with larger objects having more inertia than smaller objects. This concept was first described by Sir Isaac Newton in his laws of motion.
