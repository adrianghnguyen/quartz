# Machine learning collaboration platforms

#status/postponed

[Hugging Face â€“ The AI community building the future.](https://huggingface.co/)  is a website which allows people from the [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] community to get together and collaborate on models, datasets and applications. It's a centralized repository and is the equivalent of a GitHub but for [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] development. It's also similar to how Docker hosts all their docker images on their equivalent. Provide a service, but then own the environment surrounding it. Interesting business strategy.

[[2023-10-19]] I started experimenting with it using LM Studio which helped me download and access a variety of repos.
