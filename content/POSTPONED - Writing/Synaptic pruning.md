## Synaptic pruning in neuroscience

> [!ai]+ Auto-generated
>
> Synaptic pruning is a concept in neuroscience that refers to the process of eliminating unnecessary or weak connections between neurons in the brain. It involves the removal of certain synaptic connections while strengthening others, resulting in a more efficient and streamlined neural network.
>
> Understanding synaptic pruning can be incredibly useful as it helps us comprehend how our brain develops and adapts over time. It plays a crucial role in learning, memory formation, and overall [[Neuroplasticity|brain plasticity]]. By eliminating redundant or weak connections, synaptic pruning allows for the consolidation of important information and the formation of new neural pathways.
>
> Learning about synaptic pruning can also help us understand how habits are formed and how they can be changed. Habits are essentially strengthened connections between neurons in our brain. By deliberately reinforcing desired connections through repetition and practice, we can facilitate synaptic pruning that supports the development of positive habits while weakening unwanted ones.
>
> In summary, grasping the concept of synaptic pruning provides valuable insights into brain development, learning processes, memory formation, and [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|habit formation]] that can be applied to personal growth and self-improvement.

## Pruning our social networks

I find it interesting that brains were cut off, remove necessary reconnections between neurons within the brain. In some ways, we can apply this to other types of networks, such as relationships. [[Choose social circles wisely|Some relationships may be worth pruning]] if they're no longer beneficial to us. We are limited in our resources so we need to [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|spend energy wisely]] and be decisive where we [[Narrow your scope of work|choose to focus]].
