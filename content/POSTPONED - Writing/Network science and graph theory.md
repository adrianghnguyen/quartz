## Definition of Network graph theory

> [!ai]+ AI
> Network graph theory is a mathematical [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|framework]] that focuses on studying the properties and behaviors of complex structures composed of nodes and edges, which are called networks. Networks are represented by graphs, which are composed of a set of vertices or nodes that are connected by edges or links.
>
> One of the main goals of network graph theory is to study the structure and function of networks. The structure of a network is defined by the topology, or the way in which the nodes are connected by edges. The function of a network, on the other hand, is defined by the dynamics, or the behavior of the nodes and edges over time.
>
> Network graph theory is useful in many scientific fields, including biology, physics, computer science, and social sciences. In biology, network graph theory is used to study protein interactions, gene regulatory networks, and brain connectivity. In physics, it is used to study the structure and function of complex systems, such as the internet and power grids. In computer science, it is used to develop algorithms for social network analysis and optimization problems. In social sciences, it is used to study social networks and their impact on society.

> Related topics and interesting concepts to network graph theory include:
>
> - Centrality measures: These are metrics that identify the most important nodes or edges in a network based on their connectivity or influence.
> - Small-world networks: These are networks that exhibit a high level of clustering and a short average path length between nodes, which is characteristic of many real-world networks.
> - Community detection: This is the process of identifying densely connected groups of nodes within a network, which can provide insights into the functional organization of the network.
> - Network visualization: This involves the use of graphical representations to visualize the structure and function of networks, which can help in understanding complex relationships among entities.

## What is network science?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Network science is a field of study that uses mathematical and computational tools to analyze complex systems composed of interconnected nodes and edges. These systems can include social networks, transportation networks, biological networks, and many others. The goal of network science is to understand the structure, function, and dynamics of these systems, as well as their properties and behaviors. This interdisciplinary field draws on concepts from mathematics, computer science, physics, sociology, biology, and other fields to develop models and theories that can explain how networks evolve over time and how they impact our lives. Network theory is an important part of network science that focuses on the mathematical foundations and principles underlying network analysis.

Maybe it's worth contacting a counselor from MIT concerning their [[REF Masters of Computation and Cognition at MIT|cognitive science program at MIT]]?
