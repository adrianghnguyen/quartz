Related to [[Self-serving bias]]

## Privileged people may have a self-serving bias

Some of our [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|happiness is inherited]].

We can see this mindset in a lot of successful and wealthy people. It's not fair to paint a generalization, but some of them were born with a silver spoon, but think that they did a home run while being born on 3rd base.

They may not have considered all the structural advantages which were given to them in their lives. It's a form of privilege.
