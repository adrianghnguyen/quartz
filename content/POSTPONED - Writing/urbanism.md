> [!ai] AI
> Urbanism is the study of the design, development, and management of cities and towns. It encompasses a wide range of issues, including land use, transportation, housing, public services, and environmental sustainability.
>
> One concept that has gained popularity in recent years is the "15 Minute City." This model envisions a city where all essential amenities are located within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from home. This includes schools, grocery stores, parks, healthcare facilities, and employment centers.
>
> The idea behind the 15 Minute City is to create more livable and sustainable communities by reducing the need for cars and promoting active transportation. By providing easy access to essential services and amenities, people can reduce their carbon footprint while improving their quality of life.
>
> To achieve this vision, cities must prioritize walkability by investing in pedestrian infrastructure such as sidewalks, crosswalks, and pedestrian-friendly streetscapes. They must also ensure that public transit options are convenient and accessible to all residents.
>
> In addition to promoting active transportation, the 15 Minute City model also encourages mixed-use development. This means integrating residential areas with commercial and office spaces to create vibrant neighborhoods that are both livable and economically viable.
>
> Overall, the 15 Minute City represents an exciting shift in urban planning towards more sustainable and equitable communities. As cities continue to grow and evolve in the coming years, this model will undoubtedly play an important role in shaping their future development.
