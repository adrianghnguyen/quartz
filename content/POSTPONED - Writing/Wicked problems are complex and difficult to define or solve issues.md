> Wicked problems are complex, multifaceted issues that are difficult to define and solve. They often involve multiple stakeholders with conflicting interests and values. Unlike simple or tame problems, wicked problems have no clear-cut solutions and can evolve over time. They require a holistic approach that takes into account the social, cultural, political, and economic aspects of the problem. Resolving wicked problems often involves trade-offs and compromises rather than definitive answers.
