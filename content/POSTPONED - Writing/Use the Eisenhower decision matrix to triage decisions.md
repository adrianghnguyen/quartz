> The Eisenhower decision matrix, also known as the Eisenhower matrix or the Urgency-Importance matrix, is a tool that helps individuals prioritize tasks and make effective decisions. It was popularized by former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who emphasized the importance of distinguishing between urgent and important tasks. The matrix categorizes tasks into four quadrants: important and urgent, important but not urgent, not important but urgent, and not important and not urgent. By using this matrix, individuals can focus on tasks that are both important and urgent, while delegating or eliminating tasks that are not necessary or can be done at a later time.

> Urgent and important may seem like similar words, but when analyzing them in terms of the Eisenhower principle, the difference between the two is crucial. Differentiating between urgent and important within the Eisenhower Matrix can help you identify which tasks you should jump on and which tasks might be better handled by other team members.^[https://asana.com/resources/eisenhower-matrix]
