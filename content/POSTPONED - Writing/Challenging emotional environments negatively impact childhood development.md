If the child exhibits difficulties or cries, their behavior might be [[Emotional suppression and denial|dismissed]] as attention-seeking. Failures are taken personally, and when the child is messy, they are met with disgust. The child's attempts to show strength might be met with threats, while their moments of weakness and lack of impressiveness lead to belittlement.

In essence, in a bad childhood, the child is made to feel like they don't truly deserve to exist. They may come to see themselves as a burden and, in the end, perceive themselves as a significant disappointment. This negative environment can lead to emotional challenges, relationship issues, sexual problems, low self-esteem, and a profound sense of shame and self-hatred that can persist throughout life.
