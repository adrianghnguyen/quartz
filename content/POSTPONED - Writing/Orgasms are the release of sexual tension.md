## Orgasms are the experience of physical release

This differs between men and women and from individual to individuals. It can sometimes be hard to decipher. Most women describe it as a sense of doneness. One might experience a peak of tension in muscles, and where our heart pounds - it is not a [[Genital response does not equate to sexual arousal|genital response]]. "You'll know it when you see it"^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]. One way to increase this capacity is to [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|practice]] [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|mindfulness]] and attention redirection. This will help avoid one becoming a spectator ("spectatoring") which creates performance anxiety. Remember that pleasure is a [[Perception aka Mood|perception]] of sensation.

Orgasms may not be an [[Find your niche|evolutionary adaptation]] since it has no ties to reproductive success but rather being a vestigial organ as a result of its penis [[Homology aka same parts organized differently|homologue]]. Additionally, women are more likely to have orgasms later in the relationship than the first time they have sex with a new partner.

Good brain-melting orgasms only happen under good context. Everything needs to be aligned in regards to our internal states, such as: physical comfort, hunger, thirst, [[Sleep is important|sleepiness]], loneliness, frustration, etc for us to experience this since it interacts with our emotional [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|one Emotional Ring]] in a [[Integration as biological process|process of integration]].

### Scientific definition of orgasm

Orgasm is the sudden involuntary release of sexual tension.^[Kinsey and colleagues (1948, 158) defined orgasm as “a sudden release which produces local spasms or more extensive or all-consuming convulsions.” Masters and Johnson’s (1966, 6) “orgasmic phase” was “those few seconds during which the vasoconcentration [constriction of blood vessels] and myotonia [muscle constriction] developed from [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|sexual stimuli]] are released. This involuntary climax is reached at any level that represents maximum sexual tension increment for the particular occasion.” You’ll notice these are more inclusive than the twenty-first-century “consensus that a woman’s orgasm involves a transient peak of intense sexual pleasure associated with rhythmic contractions of the pelvic circumvaginal musculature, often with concomitant uterine and anal contractions” (Bianchi-Demicheli and Ortigue, “Toward an Understanding of Cerebral Substrates,” 2646). This “consensus” definition contradicts the research on nonconcordance and on the contextual absence of pleasure with orgasm. From [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]] Within this definition, there is no mention of General's muscle contraction, sexual behavior, pleasure. It is completely individual.

Even physical contractions aren't a reliable marker of orgasms. It's all in the brain.^[Georgiadis et al., “Sweetest Taboo.”]

### What orgasms are not - nonconcordance of orgasms

1. Not a [[Genital response does not equate to sexual arousal|genital response]]
2. Not a pinnacle of [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|pleasure]] - it depends on context, kind of like being tickled.
3. Not hierarchical - there's no specific flow and many ways to experience it
4. Vaginal orgasms don't occur for most women unless there is mechanical stimulation

## Few will climax from vaginal intercourse

> The dominance of the clitoris in women’s orgasms explains why 80–90 percent of women who masturbate typically do so with little or no vaginal penetration, including when they use vibrators.
>
> This number has been replicated multiple times, using multiple methodologies, in multiple studies, including Kinsey’s female volume and The Hite Report. The highest rate of penetration during masturbation I’ve seen comes from a 2007 study where women responded to the statement, “I use vibrators or introduce some objects into the vagina”; 21.4 percent said yes at least sometimes (Carvalheira and Leal, “Masturbation Among Women”). It’s important to note that vibrators are typically used externally; Davis, Blank, Lin, and Bonillas (“Characteristics of Vibrator Use among Women”) found that 3 percent (3 out of 115) of women masturbated with a vibrator “primarily” in their vaginas and 24 percent (36/115) with the vibrator on “various genital sites,” which might include the vagina; 14 percent (11 out of 79) reported primarily an “in and out” movement of the vibrator; and 79 percent of women reported that clitorial-vibrator stimulation during solo masturbation “usually or always resulted in orgasm,” 30 percent reported that vaginal-vibrator stimulation did so.
>
> In addition, according to Hite (1976), 1.5 percent of women masturbate exclusively with vaginal penetration; 5 percent of women always enter their vaginas during masturbation; 1 percent penetrate the vagina at orgasm, with one hand also stimulating the vulva; another 1 percent penetrate the vagina to obtain lubrication. Kinsey et al. (1953, 161) note an anatomical distinction between the vagina and the introitus:
>
> Many of those who reported “vaginal penetrations” in masturbation failed to distinguish the vestibule of the vagina (which is well equipped with nerve endings) from the vagina itself (which is poorly equipped or devoid of nerve endings). In many instances, the female’s fingers had been inserted only far enough beyond the musculature ring which lives at the vaginal entrance (the introitus) to provide a firm hold for the rest of her hand while it was stimulating the outer portions of her genitalia.

## The clitoris is the grand central of erotic sensation

The clitoris and penis are the external genital organs most densely packed with nerve endings. This is a result of [[Homology aka same parts organized differently|homology]]. For women, it  is "Grand Central Station of erotic sensation. Averaging just one-eighth the size of a penis yet loaded with nearly double the nerve endings, it can range in size from a barely visible pea to a fair-sized gherkin, or anywhere in between, and it’s all normal, all beautiful."^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]. Focus on the whole thing rather than just the external.

> Its only purpose is sensation while the penis has four jobs: sensation, penetration, ejaculation, urination.

## Ecstasy is achieved through orgasm's integrative process

The most pleasurable orgasms happen when we are present and everything is working towards pursuit of one shared goal, which is ecstasy. As a result of [[Integration as biological process|integration processes]], many things need to be pointing towards orgasm for us to enjoy it. See [[Flock of birds metaphor|flock of birds metaphor for self-organization]].

> And if your brain is a flock, then orgasm is a destination the flock can fly toward—a magnetic pole—and sexual pleasure is the flock itself. Sexual pleasure emerges, like flocking behavior, from the interaction of all these different birds.
>
> The more birds you have flying toward orgasm, the greater the pleasure you experience. If some of the birds are flying toward orgasm but others are trying to accomplish some other goal—as in, you’re trying to masturbate to orgasm, but your feet are cold—the “flock” that is your brain will not move simultaneously in the same direction. Some of the birds may arrive at orgasm, but the experience won’t be the same as if all the birds got there.^[ [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]]
