## What is software development lifecycle?

![[Pasted image 20230315103707.png|400]]

> The software development lifecycle (SDLC) is a process that outlines the stages involved in creating software applications. It typically involves planning, designing, developing, testing, and deploying software. Each stage in the SDLC has specific tasks and goals that must be completed before moving on to the next stage, with the ultimate goal of delivering high-quality software that meets user requirements. The SDLC may also include maintenance and support activities after the software is deployed to ensure its ongoing performance and functionality.

> The software development lifecycle (SDLC) typically involves six stages:
>
> 1. Planning: The first stage of SDLC involves defining the scope of the project, creating a roadmap, and outlining the project goals and objectives.
>
> 2. Requirement Analysis: The second stage involves gathering detailed requirements from stakeholders, customers, and end-users. This step is crucial as it lays the foundation for the rest of the SDLC process.
>
> 3. Design: The third stage involves designing the architecture of the software solution. This includes creating a high-level design, developing a low-level design, and selecting technology stacks.
>
> 4. Development: During this stage, developers write code according to the design specifications defined in earlier stages.
>
> 5. Testing: The fifth stage involves testing the software solution for bugs or errors that could affect its performance or functionality.
>
> 6. Deployment: Once testing is complete, and all issues are resolved, it's time to launch or deploy the software solution into production.
>
> 7. Maintenance: After deployment, regular maintenance is required to keep the software up-to-date with any new updates or changes in requirements.
>
> These stages can vary depending on different SDLC methodologies like Agile or Waterfall but typically cover all aspects of software development from start to finish.
