## Difference between self-esteem and self-respect

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Self-esteem refers to how a person feels about themselves or their overall sense of self-worth. It is the subjective evaluation of one's own abilities, appearance, and value as a person. Self-esteem can be influenced by external factors such as achievements, social acceptance, or feedback from others.
>
> On the other hand, self-respect is about recognizing and valuing one's own worth and dignity as a human being. It involves treating oneself with kindness, compassion, and care, and setting healthy boundaries in relationships. Self-respect is not dependent on [[external validation]] or achievements but rather stems from an internal sense of self-worth.
> While self-esteem focuses more on how one perceives themselves in relation to others and their accomplishments, self-respect emphasizes the importance of self-care and self-acceptance. Self-esteem can fluctuate based on external factors or circumstances, whereas self-respect is rooted in an unwavering belief in one's inherent worth as a person.
>
> In summary, self-esteem relates to how one feels about themselves in terms of their abilities and appearance, while self-respect pertains to valuing oneself as a human being and treating oneself with kindness and dignity.

It can take many forms, including formal education, informal learning experiences, and self-directed learning. Embracing continuous learning allows individuals to adapt to change, stay relevant in their fields, and continuously develop their abilities.
