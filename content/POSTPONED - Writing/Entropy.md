## What is entropy?

> [!ai] AI
>
> Entropy is a measure of the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. It is a thermodynamic property that reflects the amount of energy in a system that is not available to do useful work. **The higher the entropy, the more disordered or random the system, and the *less useful energy* it contains.**
>
> Entropy can be calculated for any closed system, and it always increases over time as energy is dissipated and becomes less organized. In physics, entropy is often represented by the symbol S and measured in units of joules per kelvin (J/K).

- Entropy is the thermodynamic phenomena that energy goes from high to low energy states, or order to disorder over a period of time. (???) https://www.quora.com/Does-entropy-in-laymans-terms-mean-for-something-to-fall-into-decay-or-ruin-over-time

- [[REF Removing the entropy from the definition of entropy clarifying the relationship between evolution, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics|disambiguation of entropy]]  <- review this to clear up misunderstandings on the concept. Boy language is complicated.

## Information entropy

> [!ai] AI
>
> Information entropy is a term used in information theory and computer science to describe the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a given piece of information. It is often used to measure the efficiency of data storage and compression, as well as to evaluate the security of cryptographic algorithms.
>
> The concept of entropy was first introduced by Claude Shannon in his 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication." Shannon defined entropy as the average amount of information contained in a message, measured in bits, that is necessary to convey its meaning. **The more uncertain or unpredictable the message is, the higher its entropy will be.**
>
> Entropy can be calculated using various mathematical formulas, such as Shannon entropy or Kolmogorov complexity. These calculations involve analyzing the frequency and distribution of symbols or patterns within a message or data set.
>
> In practical applications, information entropy is often used to improve data compression algorithms by identifying and removing redundancies in the data. This can significantly reduce file sizes and improve transmission speeds. Entropy also plays a crucial role in cryptography, where it is used to generate secure encryption keys and evaluate the strength of encryption algorithms.
>
> Overall, information entropy provides a valuable tool for measuring and understanding the complexity and uncertainty present in digital information.

In what domains does entropy come up?

## Chaos theory and entropy

> Entropy is basically the number of ways a system can be rearranged and have the same energy. Chaos implies an exponential dependence on initial conditions. Colloquially they can both mean "disorder" but in physics they have different meanings.^[https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1iptuc/can_someone_explain_the_difference_between/cb6unm5/]

I don't get it.

- [Chaos Theory](https://www.reviewofophthalmology.com/article/chaos-theory#:~:text=Entropy%20is%20a%20loss%20of,happen%2C%20when%20order%20breaks%20down.)
- [How does entropy relate to chaos theory? + Example](https://socratic.org/questions/how-does-entropy-relate-to-chaos-theory)
- apparently many people conflate the two and relate it to the second law of thermodynamics

### Define chaos theory

> [!ai] AI
>
> Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamic systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, meaning that small changes in the initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. It seeks to understand the underlying patterns and structures within seemingly random or chaotic systems, and how they evolve over time. Chaos theory has applications in many fields, including physics, biology, economics, and engineering.

> [!ai] AI
>
> Entropy and chaos theory are related concepts that relate to the unpredictability and disorder of systems. Entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system, while chaos theory studies the behavior of complex systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions.
>
> Entropy is a physical concept that describes the amount of energy in a system that is no longer available to do useful work. In thermodynamics, entropy is often associated with the tendency of systems to move towards a state of maximum disorder or randomness.
>
> Chaos theory, on the other hand, studies the behavior of complex systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. This means that small changes in the initial conditions can lead to very different outcomes over time. Chaos theory has applications in various fields such as physics, biology, economics, and meteorology.
>
> Overall, both entropy and chaos theory are important concepts for understanding the behavior of complex systems and predicting how they will evolve over time.

> Chaos Theory and the Second Law of Thermodynamics
>
> Entropy is a fundamental concept in physics, chemistry, and information theory that describes the degree of disorder or randomness in a system. It is often associated with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a closed system always increases over time.
>
> In chaos theory, entropy is used to measure the unpredictability or complexity of a system. As a system becomes more chaotic, its entropy increases and its behavior becomes more difficult to predict.
>
> The relationship between entropy and chaos theory is rooted in the principles of thermodynamics. According to these principles, energy flows from high to low temperature regions until a state of equilibrium is reached. However, this process inevitably leads to an increase in the total entropy of the system, as energy is dissipated and dispersed.
>
> In chaotic systems, this increase in entropy can lead to unpredictable behavior and sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that even small changes in the starting conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes over time.
>
> Overall, entropy and chaos theory are crucial concepts for understanding complex systems and phenomena in physics, chemistry, biology, economics, and other fields. By studying these principles, scientists can gain insights into how seemingly random or chaotic processes actually follow underlying patterns and rules.
