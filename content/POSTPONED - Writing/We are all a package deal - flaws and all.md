Related to [[Marry Him by Lori Gottlieb]]

We should seek to focus on the positive aspects of our partner, rather than dwelling on the negative things. We are all a package deal - or a blue plate special.

We have to take the annoying habits and unpleasant features of a person to get the best things about them. Otherwise, we're just living with a delusion or [[Hypocrisy|being hypocritical]].
