# Gestalt theory

> There are six individual principles commonly associated with gestalt theory: **similarity**, **continuation**, **closure**, **proximity**, **figure/ground**, and **symmetry & order** (also called _prägnanz_). There are also some additional, newer principles sometimes associated with gestalt, such as [common fate](http://www.andyrutledge.com/common-fate.html).

> The Gestalt principles, also known as the laws of perceptual organization, are a set of principles that describe how humans perceive and organize visual information.
> 1. Figure-Ground: Humans tend to perceive objects as either a figure (the main object of focus) or the ground (the background against which the figure is perceived). This principle helps in distinguishing objects from their background.
> 2. Proximity: Objects that are close to each other tend to be perceived as a group or a single entity. This principle helps in grouping related items together.
> 3. Similarity: Objects that share similar characteristics, such as shape, color, size, or texture, are perceived as belonging to the same group. This principle helps in organizing and grouping similar elements.
> 4. Closure: Humans tend to perceive incomplete or fragmented objects as complete by mentally filling in the missing parts. This principle helps in perceiving whole objects even if they are not fully present.
> 5. Continuity: Humans tend to perceive smooth and continuous patterns rather than abrupt changes or interruptions. This principle helps in organizing visual information into meaningful and continuous forms.
> 6. Symmetry: Humans tend to perceive objects that are symmetrical as more organized and visually pleasing. This principle helps in perceiving balance and order in visual compositions.
> 7. Common Fate: Objects that move in the same direction or have a common goal are perceived as belonging to the same group. This principle helps in perceiving motion and understanding relationships between moving objects.
> These principles play a crucial role in how we perceive and make sense of visual information, helping us organize complex scenes into meaningful perceptual units.
