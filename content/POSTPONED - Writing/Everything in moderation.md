# Avoiding dabbling in extremes

#status/postponed 

---

I think it is quite easy as humans to fall into [[Black or white-thinking|all or nothing thinking]], whether it be in action or thoughts. We sprint for the finish, covet everything for the moment. But life does not simply work that way it seems. A lot of evidence seems to show that [[The marshmallow experiment showcases that delayed gratification leads to better life outcomes|delayed gratification]] and the [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|ability to persist]] is what leads to [[Success requires time and patience|long-term success]].

But from reflections on the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|course on managing happiness]], [[The Happiness Equation|happiness]] is what leads us to long-term success. So perhaps I need to reflect on my [[Use the reverse bucket list strategy to create sustainable joy|reverse bucket list strategy]] to pursue this with extreme prejudice. Once I have eliminated things which do not seem to currently work [[2023-10-20|today]], then perhaps I can add back in the habits needed.

Have I lost vision of [[My career mission|my career mission]]? It's something I had little time and energy to think about in recent times. For now, the best thing I can do I think is to find [[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments|joy in the little things]].

Being in a hurry, wanting things to happen now. I don't think that's how the world works. A lot of our luck is built from surrounding circumstances, the question becomes - are you ready for it? Are you willing to seize it? 

## Middle path from Buddhism

> The Middle Path is a key concept in Buddhism that emphasizes moderation and avoiding extremes. It was taught by the Buddha as a way to transcend suffering and achieve enlightenment. The Middle Path encourages individuals to avoid indulging in sensual pleasures and self-mortification, finding balance instead. By practicing moderation in all aspects of life, one can find peace and liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
