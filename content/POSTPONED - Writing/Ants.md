## Context

With the coming of th warmer weather, I've had a lot of ants coming into my place. I've sat down some traps, but it started making me think about their behavior. What would happen to them if we changed their soil materials in terms of their nest? Would it affect their behavior? So I'm starting to some poking at it and taking a look. I asked ChatGPT to find me some academic papers researching this topic.

### The prototypical scientist and the magnifying glass

Isn't there anything better than the stereotypical curious child, pretending to be a scientist in using a magnifying glass to burn some ants? In many ways, it is a cruel act. But I think it is an example of the behavior of how humans are [[Curiosity is a basic motivation|naturally curious]].

## What happens to ants when they lack building nesting material or run out of space?

> When an ant colony runs out of space or resources to expand their nest, they will typically do one of the following:
>
> 1.  Adapt the current nest: Ants are resourceful creatures and may find ways to maximize the use of their existing space. They may create more intricate tunnels and chambers, or repurpose old or unused areas within the nest. They may also adjust the allocation of resources, such as food storage or brood care, to optimize the available space.
> 2.  Relocate the colony: If the lack of space becomes a significant issue, the ants may decide to move to a new location with more space and resources. Scout ants will search for suitable locations nearby, and when a suitable new site is found, the colony will begin the process of relocating. The queen, brood, and food stores will be moved, and worker ants will start constructing a new nest.
> 3.  Split the colony: In some cases, the colony may divide into multiple smaller colonies. This typically happens when the colony has grown too large, and resources are becoming scarce. A new queen (or queens) may emerge, and a portion of the worker ants will accompany her to establish a new colony elsewhere. This process is called "colony fission" or "budding."
> 4.  Competition and conflict: In some cases, when resources are limited, ants may engage in competition with neighboring colonies or other species. This can lead to territorial disputes, battles, or raids to secure resources. However, ants are also known to engage in mutualistic relationships with other species when resources are scarce, exchanging services for resources.
> 5.  Collapse: If a colony is unable to adapt, relocate, or split, it may eventually collapse due to lack of space and resources. This can lead to the death of the colony members or dispersal of individual ants as they search for a new place to live.
>
> It's important to note that ant species vary in their behavior, and some may employ different strategies when faced with a lack of space or resources.

## Research on ants building nests in foreign soil materials

Honestly, if I had money, I would send a pack of ants to the moon and see what their behavior would be.

Wilson provides a comprehensive overview of ant biology, including nesting behaviors and preferences. It discusses how ants can adapt to various soil types and conditions.

This paper examines the nest structures of various ant species and their adaptability to different soil types. The author discusses how ants can modify their nesting behavior based on the soil conditions they encounter.

This paper discusses the nesting habits of seed-harvester ants in North America, including their ability to adapt to different soil types. The author notes that some species can build nests in various soil materials, including those that are not native to their original range.

> While these papers do not specifically focus on ants building nests in foreign soil materials, they do provide insights into the adaptability of ants to different soil types and environmental conditions. It is worth noting that ants are highly adaptable creatures, and their ability to thrive in various soil materials is likely an important factor in their success as a group.

### Return to default

> Most significantly, when the social structure is disrupted experimentally or by a move to a new
> nest, workers resume the same positions they occupied in the previous nest (Sendova Franks and
> Franks, 1995). The payoff returned by the nest, although currently unknown, must be considerable, for the large amounts of energy invested in nest excavation (up to 10% of daily energy intake; Sudd, 1969) could have been invested in other fitness-enhancing functions instead.

Return to monke? disruption to the status quo? similar to [[homeostatic systems|homeostasis]]?

### Nest variations is more of a result of species difference

It's interesting to know that the variation in tunnels and nuts is more a result of the species, so much more so than the materials when held equivalent^[Tschinkel, W. R. (2003). Subterranean ant nests: trace fossils past and future?. _Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology_, _192_(1-4), 321-333.] Could we think of it as their respective needs versus the environment shaping their behaviour akin to nurture vs nature? Ant species will optimize for their specific needs rather than a global optimization solution. Some basic instinct would've said they would have all [[Multiple discovery of solutions|converged on a specific answer]]

According to the paper, it seems like ants actually use carbon dioxide levels to know their current location.
