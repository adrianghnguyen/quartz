> Prospect theory is a behavioral economic theory that describes how people make decisions under risk and uncertainty. It was first proposed by psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979, and it has since become a widely influential model for understanding human decision-making.
>
> The theory posits that people evaluate potential gains and losses in relation to a reference point, which is often the status quo or a recent experience. People are more sensitive to losses than gains, meaning that the [[Loss aversion explains why losing is more painful than the pleasure of gain|pain of losing]] something is greater than the pleasure of gaining something of equal value. This phenomenon is known as [[Loss aversion explains why losing is more painful than the pleasure of gain]].
>
> Prospect theory also suggests that people are not rational when it comes to decision-making, as traditional economic models assume. Instead, they tend to make decisions based on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, that help them simplify complex situations. For example, people may focus on the likelihood of an event occurring rather than the overall expected value of an outcome.
>
> Overall, prospect theory helps to explain why people often make decisions that seem irrational or inconsistent with economic models. It has important implications for fields such as finance, public policy, and marketing, as it highlights the importance of framing and context in influencing people's decisions.

It also helps to explain [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones|negativity bias]] ([[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones]]). It's presented by Daniel Kahneman author of [[Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman]] and the winning economic paper of the dual process theory ([[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning]]).
