# Glia cells provide the structure of neurons

#status/postponed

Related to [[Nervous system transmits signals within the body and brain]]

> The nervous system also includes non-neuron cells, called **glia** (pronounced _GLEE-uh_). Glia perform many important functions that keep the nervous system working properly. For example, glia:
>
> -   Help support and hold neurons in place
> -   Protect neurons
> -   Create insulation called **[[Myelinization is the creation of informational priority neural pathways|myelin]],** which helps move nerve impulses
> -   Repair neurons and help restore neuron function
> -   Trim out dead neurons
> -   Regulate neurotransmitters
>
> The brain is made up of many networks of communicating neurons and glia. These networks allow different parts of the brain to “talk” to each other and work together to control body functions, emotions, thinking, behavior, and other activities.[1](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/neuro/conditioninfo/parts#f1),[2](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/neuro/conditioninfo/parts#f2),[3](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/neuro/conditioninfo/parts#f3)

They're the custodians of the neurons.
