# Seek truth over accuracy

#status/postponed

Related to [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible]]

I'm doing my best and at the end of the day, I know that seeking truth is more important to me than being correct. [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|Learning new things requires habit]].  I am open to my ideas being challenged - but I would hope that they can bring something to the table.

It's best to practice [[Be a kinder person by not blaming others|empathy]] and recognize that we all have our own [[Brains are biased by nature|bias]] - including how we choose to live one's life and learn. Not everyone shares the priority of being [[Curiosity as my worldview|curious]] perhaps because it is ranked differently within their [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|personal values]].

Perhaps [[Be succinct when communicating|some things are better left unsaid]] when talking with another person for fear of antagonizing or causing arguments - is it really important in this crux of the moment?
