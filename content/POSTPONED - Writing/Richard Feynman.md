# Richard Feynman

> Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist, known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as his work in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model.

He's someone I respect incredibly and was an incredible person at communicating science. He's someone who sought to share his [[Curiosity as my worldview|curiosity as his world lens]] with others through encouraging them to engage in science. He's been influential to many including myself in his ways of thinking (see [[Richard Feynman#Way of Thinking by Richard Feynman]]).

> “Feynman,” the teacher said, “you talk too much and you make too much noise. I know why. You’re bored. So I’m going to give you a book. You go up there in the back, in the corner, and study this book, and when you know everything that’s in this book, you can talk again.”

> So each day, Feynman would hide in the back of the classroom and study the book—Advanced Calculus by Woods—while the rest of the class continued with their regular lessons. And it was while studying this old calculus textbook that Feynman began to develop his own set of mental models.

## How to learn effectively with the feynman technique

For example, in how to learn quickly ([[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more]]), they recommend to use the Feynman technique ([[Learn anything like Feynman]]). To sum it up in a nutshell

1. starting your basic knowledge, write out everything you know about it.
2. Try and explain the difficult concepts in simple terms
3. Identify your knowledge gaps by being ruthless in your self-evaluation and feedback
4. Re-organize the information in a way which makes sense to you and seek to teach it to others - it will show you where there's still room to grow.
