## Philosophy of objective truth in a subjective world aka mathematics

> [!NOTE] Mathematics = Epistemology = Science ~= Perception
> In a nutshell, the philosophy of mathematics deals with the special problems that arise from our possession of mathematical knowledge.
>
> Therefore it is a branch of **epistemology**, **the study of how we know things**, just as *philosophy of science* and *philosophy of perception* are.
>
> FYI: The title of this callout is a self-referential joke. and not mathematically sound

> [!quote] Reconciling mathematical proofs and our understanding of the world
> What is truth? How do we decide if a theoretical idea that we cannot measure or examine is correct? We want the notion of proof to be something that’s completely objective.
>
> We don’t actually live up to that ideal, because **we also want proofs to be about ideas**—about presenting the explanation of why something should be true. Mathematicians find long lists of formulas as boring and unintuitive as everyone else, so real proofs—the way actual human mathematicians write them—are arguments written in ordinary (though very jargon-filled) English. They need to be **clear and exact enough** to persuade other experts.
> \- Henry Towsner, Associate Professor of Mathematics at uPenn

Humans are driven to fit information into their worldview, aka their [[Brains organize information into schemas|schemas]] ([[Brains organize information into schemas]]) but this can be difficult as we are subject to bias ([[Brains are biased by nature]]). The brain is good at making itself look good when in reference to itself of course.

Maybe we are constantly seeking the truth because we inherently wish to reduce our [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency]] and are uncomfortable ([[View challenges as opportunities]]) dealing with what does not fit our preconceived notions.

Updating our [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]] requires concerted effort ([[Deliberate practice leads to mastery]]) and it's easier to reject the idea because it would mean that something within us would be lacking. Perhaps this is why we a natural tendency for the [[Fundamental attribution error]] to explain faults.

Is this perhaps why [[Geniuses and divergent thinking|HPI]] individuals are obsessive in their behavior of curiosity ([[Curiosity as my worldview]])? They wish to be clear and exact in their wording. Uncertainty is uncomfortable.

### Even math isn't objective

> [!reference] When mathematical proofs can be misunderstood
> The challenge is introducing a *language that is precise enough* that people can say what they mean and make their arguments clearly enough so that we can check if they’re foolproof. I think philosophers of all stripes would be very happy if they could say everything in a language that absolutely *could not be misunderstood*. In this sense, philosophy can be much harder than math, because it’s often more difficult to have that level of precision.
>
> But *there are exceptions where mathematics can be similarly imprecise.* There’s an example from the early 1800s that’s notorious. One of the founders of analysis, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, gave a proof of a result, and then, several decades later, people realized the result wasn’t true. Then, more recently, people have gone back and argued that perhaps Cauchy’s proof was totally correct and people just misunderstood what his result was. Either way, *it’s a serious problem if we can’t agree on when a proof is correct, or even what we’re trying to prove.*
> \-Henry Towsner

I guess it's why wording matters when we communicate ([[Process of communication]]) with others ([[Good communication requires effortful engagement]])

## Building knowledge incrementally

> Mathematicians have an official answer to what proof is: It’s a list of formal mathematical formulas where each is deduced by the rules of logic from previous steps, or from the “axioms”—our basic, agreed-upon assumptions.

A proof is a series of steps which allow to reach a conclusion. At its fundamental roots, the basic axioms are atomic. This is a parallel to [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]], where we test our fundamental assumptions, in other words, the axioms.

Testing fundamental assumptions and [[Embrace contradiction with an open mind|updating our beliefs]] is exemplified by the Bayes Theorem

It is perhaps humanity's attempt to turn what it understands about the world into something it can process ([[Inputs are transformed into outputs]]) and understand.

This would be similar to cumulative knowledge ([[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality]]), the scientific method of academia - which is built on prior references from the works of others to expand humanity's knowledge ([[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]) and the business concept of marginal gains.
