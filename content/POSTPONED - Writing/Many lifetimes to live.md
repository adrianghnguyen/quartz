# Many lifetimes to live is constant opportunities to reinvent ourselves

Related to [[Personal growth is becoming a better person]]

Life is long with many lifetimes to live.

It can be [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|easy for me to become negative or pessimistic about my future]]. There's a lot of self-doubt and feeling like I failed. Instead, I'd like to change my mindset and adopt an approach of [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche|embracing life]]. [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|Use the Hope Circuit to fight emotions of pessimism and hopelessness.]]

But my friend%%[[Tim Vieregge|Tim Vieregge]]%% shared with me this comic, and it makes a good point. It takes about seven years to master something, and if we live to be older, then we have many opportunities to live. Realistically, we're all going to encounter some kind of failure at some point in our life. It's okay to realize that we went off track.

But the best thing we can do is to [[Learned optimism is a skill|stay optimistic]], seek new opportunities and to not give up.

We have different lifetimes to go through. Let's make the most of it. [[Being patient leads to better decisions|Be patient.]]

## Maturing as different people

Related to [[Change happens in weeks and seasons]]

A friend [[Richard Yang]] shared me one of his favourite articles where he saw himself as multiple version as inspired by the article called [Versioning Myself](https://salman.io/blog/versions/).

### Imagining life as seasons and branches

Instead of seeing myself as versions which is more of a linear thing I think of it as more of seasons. When we think of seasons, we can think of trees and branches which is similar to git. If we think closer to the concept of [[Github|file version control]], then instead of seeing it as a linear approach you can have multiple branches.

Sometimes you might have a feature branch which pans out which you merge into your main branch. And sometimes you will get rid of a feature completely. It doesn't imply that you wasted your time, but rather that you discovered something that which didn't work.

I think it puts a lot of pressure on us to be constantly improving when sometimes it's just about taking a different direction. We shouldn't be obsessed with time as linear. This is a concept also explored within the book 4000 weeks which my friend [[Richard Yang|Richard Yang]] also recommended

### Longer-time frames

The point of also [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|thinking in seasons to think on the longer timescale]]. Often times I will see people write objectives out in weeks or plan out to the day, but as we know it, no plan survives first contact.

We need to remain adaptable and goals might shift and then we can think of it in terms of dynamic system theory for us moving towards a goal might cause us to self organize and develop new goals in themselves.

As a result, when we think in the season for example spring winter summer fall, we think of longer time horizons because humans are prone to underestimating their efforts which I've learned first hand in project management.

It's important to give ourselves a decent amount of buffer for when we're [[Notes Central Hub/General notes/Monthly over daily planning is more sustainable for a resilient routine|planning things]]. When I tend to plan out things and I think I have a certain time I tend to double it. This doesn't mean that I don't make smaller goals which are timebox to motivate myself moving forward but at least it gives me a bit of flexibility on the day-to-day basis.

This entire concept makes me think of [[Conceptual change is the process of changing our mental models over time|behavioural change]] and [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological impasse]].
