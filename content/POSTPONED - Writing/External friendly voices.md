# Imagine a counsel of friendly voices to provide advice

#status/postponed

One technique that has been helpful to me is to picture a counsel of advisors or imagine the voice of a kind friend "What wisdom would **they** provide about this situation?". %% I often think of [[Tim Vieregge|Tim Vieregge]], [[Lei Lopez]], [[Justin Li|Justin Li]], [[Mary Ma|Mary Ma]], and [[Jessica Ly Ngo|Jessica Ly Ngo]] has been quite sweet as well. I think I can add  [[Will Valle|Will Valle]] in this :)%%

We should seek the advice from people we consider to be [[Traits and qualities of strong relationships|high quality relationships]]. I can also draw upon the [[Personal sources of inspiration|people who inspire me]] when it comes to [[Dealing with our inner critic|dealing with my inner critic]]. If my inner voice is cruel, then perhaps I can borrow theirs instead - and that's part of the process of [[Neuroplasticity|learning to rewire]] and develop the new habit of [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]].

Sometimes, externalizing our thought process can make it easier to deal with [[Emotional pain is psychological distress and suffering|emotional suffering]] - it creates a level of psychological distance rather than [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|being stuck in our thoughts]].
## Imagine a friendly voice of someone you admire and apply it to yourself

> 1. Write a description of a situation that you’re beating yourself up about—it can be anything from an aspect of your sexual functioning to your romantic relationship (or lack thereof) to your work to your body or anything else. Be sure to include the self-critical thoughts you’re battering yourself with.
>
> 2. Then write the name of a [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|good friend]] at the top of the page and imagine that that person is describing this problem. Imagine that she’s asking for your help, and write down what you would tell her. Imagine that you’re in your best, most empathic, calmest, most supportive state of mind, and tell her all the things she needs to hear.

> 3. Now reread what you wrote. It’s for you.
