## My thoughts and reflections

Talks about the power of being accountable, receiving feedback and this intermingling of new ideas? It generates more investment from both yourself through the leverage of social forces and creates connections with your network providing new opportunities.  We crave recognition from others and it can manifest itself as a social pressure with a person's need to conform, but this can also be used for the positive such as inspiring you to be accountable. For example, with my friend [[Tim Vieregge]] we are doing daily meditation check-ins and so far we've had a good streak while inspiring us to share more moments of our daily lives with each there. There's a lot of joy ([[Joie de vivre is joy in the little moments]]) in being able to have mutual [[Self-disclosure is revealing personal information to others|self-disclosure]] which bring us closer ([[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited]]). Working with the garage up can be a way of inviting others to see your inner thoughts and provide a loop of feedback ([[Feedback loop]])

## Original article title: work with the garage door up

One of my favorite ways that creative people communicate is by “working with their garage door up,” to riff on a passage from Robin Sloan (below). This is the opposite of the Twitter account which mostly posts announcements of finished work: it’s [Screenshot Saturday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday?lang=en); it’s giving a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. It’s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette. [Anti-marketing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS).

I love this kind of communication personally, but I suspect it also creates more invested, interesting followings over the long term. That effect’s probably related to [Working on niche, personally-meaningful projects brings weirder, more serendipitous inbounds](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2DABWsGLkXcCuUet2scfD1duL1ZHBztwGKp). It’s also a way to avoid the problems described in [Pitching out corrupts within](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zqG92bvaL58AWMeL97jXaRd1Dm6hsfGvhAn).
