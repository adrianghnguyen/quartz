> [!NOTE] Fixating on worst possible outcomes
> Catastrophizing means that a person fixates on the worst possible outcome and treats it as likely, even when it is not. Therapy and medications can help people reduce, or stop catastrophizing.
>
> It is a type of cognitive distortion. Here are some examples of catastrophizing:
>
> - “If I fail this test, I will never pass school, and I will be a total failure in life.”
> - “If I don’t recover quickly from this procedure, I will never get better, and I will be disabled my entire life.”
> - “If my partner leaves me, I will never find anyone else, and I will never be happy again.”
>
> Doctors also call catastrophizing “magnifying” because a person makes a situation seem much worse than it is.
>
> [Research suggests](https://painsa.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pain-resilience-and-catastrophising.pdf) that catastrophizing can worsen both physical and mental health outcomes. For example, people with chronic pain who catastrophize may experience more severe pain.

### How to Stop Catastrophizing

> Common causes include [[depression]], [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]], BIS-BAS dysregulation, and interoceptive sensitivity.
>
> Anxiety [is closely linked](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470361/) to catastrophizing.
>
> People with anxiety experience heightened fear and preoccupation with danger or [[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|threats]]. For example, they might worry about an upcoming test, going out alone, or social situations.
>
> All people feel nervous sometimes. However, anxiety disorders cause intense anxiety that interferes with daily life.

### Difference between anxiety and catastrophizing

> The primary difference between [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] and catastrophizing is that sometimes, anxiety can play a useful role in a person’s life. For example, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] can help a person protect themselves from dangerous situations. However, catastrophizing usually has no benefits.
>
> Having catastrophic thoughts can fill a person’s mind with unnecessary emotions that take time and thoughts away from reality. While both [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] and catastrophizing can be harmful, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future]] may be beneficial in some circumstances.

### Depression can lead to catastrophizing

> People with [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933) [may ruminate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430847/) on [[Meta emotions are feelings about feelings|negative emotions]], causing them to catastrophize. When a person experiences prolonged feelings of [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|hopelessness]], they may catastrophize and imagine the worst-case scenario.

### Pain catastrophizing is obsession and helplessness towards pain

> “Pain catastrophizing” [is when](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/2019/09000/Meta_analysis_of_the_psychometric_properties_of.5.aspx) a person obsesses over and worries about pain, feels helpless when they experience pain, and is unable to put worries or thoughts of pain aside.
>
> A 2019 study published in the journal _[Pain](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Abstract/2019/09000/Meta_analysis_of_the_psychometric_properties_of.5.aspx)_ reports that pain catastrophizing was highest among study participants with [generalized pain](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/chronic-pain-syndrome). This is chronic pain affecting one or more parts of the body.
>
> Additionally, a 2020 _[Frontiers in Psychology](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.603420/full)_ article emphasizes that catastrophizing may increase the intensity of pain and make it more disabling. However, some advocates, especially in the chronic pain community, [argue](https://uspainfoundation.org/blog/catastrophizing-a-form-of-pain-shaming/) that the term stigmatizes people living with pain and may dismiss their lived experiences.
