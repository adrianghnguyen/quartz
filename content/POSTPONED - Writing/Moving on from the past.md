How does one learn to move on from the past?

I can begin by [[Forgive yourself for past traumas|forgiving myself for my past traumas]] and have a greater sense of [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]]. Nurturing this, can me overcome my [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|limiting beliefs]].

such as [[Healing from emotional pain is a choice|emotional pain]] and when we [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|experience feeling stuck]].

> Moving on from the past can be a challenging process, but with time and effort, it is possible to accept what has happened and find peace. Here are some steps to help in learning to move on:
> 1. Acknowledge and accept the past: The first step is to recognize that the past cannot be changed. Accept that whatever has happened is in the past and cannot be undone. Understand that dwelling on it will only bring more pain and prevent personal growth.
> 2. Allow yourself to grieve: Give yourself permission to feel the emotions associated with past experiences. Whether it was a loss, betrayal, or failure, allow yourself to grieve and experience the pain fully. It is essential to process these emotions before moving forward.
> 3. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and gentle with yourself throughout the healing process. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and experiences hardships. Treat yourself with understanding, forgiveness, and empathy.
> 4. Focus on the present moment: Instead of constantly replaying past events in your mind, redirect your focus towards the present moment. Engage in activities that bring you joy, practice mindfulness or meditation, and cultivate gratitude for what you have now.
> 5. Learn from the past: Reflect on the lessons you can take away from your past experiences. What did you learn about yourself? How can you grow from those lessons? The past can serve as a valuable teacher if we are open to learning from it.
> 6. Surround yourself with support: Seek out the support of trusted friends, family members, or a therapist who can provide guidance during this process. Sharing your feelings and thoughts with someone who understands can help ease the burden and provide new perspectives.
> 7. Practice forgiveness: Forgiving others who have caused pain or forgiving yourself for your own mistakes can be liberating. Holding onto grudges or self-blame only prolongs suffering and prevents moving on. Forgiveness does not mean forgetting or condoning the actions, but rather releasing the negative emotions attached to them.
> 8. Set [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|healthy boundaries]]: If there are people or situations from the past that continue to bring negativity into your life, establish [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|clear boundaries]] to protect yourself. This may involve limiting contact with certain individuals, creating new routines, or seeking professional help if necessary.
> 9. Focus on personal growth: Use the past as an opportunity for personal growth and self-improvement. Channel your energy into setting new goals, exploring new interests, or enhancing your skills. This shift in focus can help you build a fulfilling future rather than dwelling on the past.
> 10. Be patient with yourself: Healing takes time, and it is essential to be patient with yourself throughout this journey. Accept that moving on is a gradual process and that setbacks are normal. Celebrate [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|small victories]] along the way and keep moving forward.
> Remember, accepting the past does not mean forgetting it entirely; it means acknowledging, learning from it, and choosing not to let it define your present and future.

## Separating sources of suffering

> We can sometimes gain motivation for this difficult work by seeing our depressed feelings as messages from our developmentally arrested child who is flashing back to his abandonment in hopes that his adult self will respond to him in a more comforting, compassionate and appropriate way.
>
> Through such practice, clients can gradually achieve the healing that the Buddhists call separating necessary suffering (normal depression) from unnecessary suffering (the internal hopelessness, shame and fear, and the life-constricting acting out that ensues from unnecessary engagements with the critic and the 4F's).
