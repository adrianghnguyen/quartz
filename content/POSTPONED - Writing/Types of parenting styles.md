> Research by Diana Baumrind, a development psychologist, showed that parents fall into four main categories or styles: **Permissive**, **Authoritative**, **Uninvolved** and **Authoritarian**. This refers to the **overall climate** in which they raise their children, rather than the actions they take.
>
> Overall, it appears the **[[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|Authoritative]]** style provides an environment that leads to the most successful outcomes from children (better academic performance, social skills and self-esteem).^[[Do you know your Parenting Style? - Parent Help](https://www.parenthelp.org.nz/parenting-style/)]

## Permissive parenting style

> Indulgent parenting, also called permissive, non-directive, lenient, libertarian, or (by supporters) anti-authoritarian, is characterized as having few behavioral expectations for the child. "Indulgent parenting is a style of parenting in which parents are very involved with their children but place few demands or controls on them".
> 
> Children of permissive parents may **tend to be more impulsive** and as adolescents **may engage more in misconduct** such as drug use, "Children never learn to control their own behavior and always expect to get their way." But in the better cases they are emotionally secure, independent and are willing to learn and accept defeat. They mature quickly and are able to live life without the help of someone else.

## Authoritative or democratic parenting style

See [[Encourage democracy as your parenting style|democratic parenting syle]]

## Uninvolved parenting style is unresponsive

> The parent is not responsive and not demanding.
>
> [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|Neglectful parents]] don’t respond to their child’s needs or desires beyond the basics of food, clothing, and shelter. Unlike the indulgent/permissive parents, neglectful parents do this because they are detached from their children's needs.
>
> Neglectful parents are unaware of what their kids are doing, and if they find out, they feel indifferent towards them. **Sometimes parents can be neglectful because of stressors they are experiencing in their own life.**
>
> Children of neglectful parents are often lonely, sad, immature, and have a difficult time to adapting to social norms. They are more likely to end up in abusive relationships, perform risky behaviors, and have increased rates of injury. They can also struggle with [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|low self-esteem]] and [[Insecure attachment styles are rooted in insecurities|emotional neediness]].

### Personal thoughts on emotional neglect in the uninvolved parenting style

Oh hey that's my childhood. My emotional neediness combined with [[Hypersensitivity in Gifted Children|hypersensitivity]] due to a mainly absent mother wasn't too great. I personally felt [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|emotionally neglected]].  I understand that [[Tran Huynh|my mom]] had a lot to deal with [[Gia-Hien Nguyen|my dad's passing]]. It created a deep gulf of isolation where I felt misunderstood and [[Loneliness is the pain of feeling alone|alone in the world]].

I remember one time in 2022 where I was on a phone call with [[Adena Lin]] and having a panic attack due to existential dread of feeling unsafe with no one to protect me as I felt a deep sense of loneliness.

See more on emotional neglect, where little is still understood by most of society in [[Running on Empty by Jonice Webb]].

## Authoritarian parenting style is demanding but not responsive to the child

> The parent is **demanding** but **not responsive**.
>
> Authoritarian parenting is a restrictive, punishment-heavy parenting style in which parents make their children follow their directions with little to no explanation or feedback and focus on the child's and family's perception and status.

> The goal of this style, at least when well-intentioned, is to teach the child to behave, survive, and thrive as an adult in a harsh and unforgiving society by preparing the child for negative responses such as [anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger "Anger") and [aggression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression "Aggression") that the child will face if their behavior is inappropriate.
