## My personal accomplishments and worth having pride for

It's about writing out a list of things which [[Self-respect|I love about myself]] as well?

- Getting into a top-tier university
- Finishing a bachelor's degree, with a distinction
- Doing well in business case competitions
- Breaking into the tech word/analytics without necessarily a suited background
- Picking up scraps here and there of programming and technology over the years
- A love of learning and a sense of personal curiosity
- All my various bike trips - not everyone is able to do >100km bike trips
	- Especially the 90km gravel bike ride - that was brutal but I did it!
- The big hike with [[Tim Vieregge]] at Tadoussac in [[2023-09|September 2023]]

## Some personal small victories

Things which made me happy or required effort - big and small. Yes, even [[Celebrating small wins and other victories|small victories]] are worth celebrating.

- Having began [[Marleen MacDonald|family therapy]] with [[Tran Huynh|mom]]
- Working on my [[Project - ASR desktop widget|ASR desktop engine]] widget
- Being consistent in being vulnerable to friends such as sharing my [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|feelings of failure]] with [[Andre Paul Johnson|AP]] and [[Mary Ma|Mary Ma]] and [[Jessica Ly Ngo|Jessica Ly Ngo]]
- Getting at job at Unity. Even though I left the organization, I remember how after leaving university I had told myself that I wanted to enter the field of tech - which I ended up doing! It was a journey to get there and it wasn't easy but I think it's important to be [[Non-zero day mindset|grateful to myself]] for going through that journey
- I was also brave in quitting a working environment which was not healthy for me - from there I was able to discover more of my hobbies such as [[My love for cycling|My love for cycling]], and spending time getting in touch with my feelings by [[Journaling is healthy|journaling]].
- [[2023-10-25]] I went for a walk - at least I got out of the house and got some movement which made me feel a bit better. It's also nice to discover a new artist while listening to music 'Violet'.
