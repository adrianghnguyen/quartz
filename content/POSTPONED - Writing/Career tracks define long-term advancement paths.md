> A career path is defined as a long-term plan that includes specific steps or tasks that help you advance to a desirable occupation or new role. There are two kinds of career paths—an organizational career path and a personal career path.

A [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career]] track can be thought of like the train on which you decided to board (rails and 'tracks'). One of the ones I am currently trying to evaluate is that of something related to cognitive science as well as that of programming. I'm trying to see what career paths may be [[Career paths which interest me|a good fit/be interesting for me]].

## Evaluating potential career options

Evaluation of varying career tracks and how they might pan out to build [[Career capital|career capital]]. It's something to think about in terms of how I can best apply my skill sets and in which path I want to acquire career capital.

The website [[The organization 80 000 hours|80,000 Hours]] has done a good job in terms of evaluating which ones may be the most promising and helping me identify what might be the best [[Career fit is about finding the right career|personal career fit]]. They go over the pros and cons and what key base traits we might need to be able to succeed in the role - by developing a [[Model of success|model of success]] for that particular career path.

> When assessing your chances on a certain [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]], the key question is:

> *With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career?*

Don't forget that it's the overlap between my wants and reality. Wherein they intersect lies the options I can pursue in terms of career. What's the right [[Career fit is about finding the right career|career fit]]? I think what's difficult is finding out - what do I want in [[My ideal work|my ideal career]]? What are my personal desires for a job? I'm not really certain.

But I need to remember that [[Self-discovery is about trying new things|self-discovery requires experimentation]].

### Evaluating realistic career options

Factors to consider in creating a 'Reality Box' of possible career paths:

> **1) The general landscape.** Take our best crack at evaluating the world’s current career landscape—the full range of options available (or create-able).
>
> **2) Specific game boards.** For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career’s current game board—the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.
>
> **3) Starting point.** For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.
>
> **4) Success point.** Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what’s the minimum level of success you’d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.
>
> **5) Your pace.** Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to *accelerate*).
>
> **6) Your level of persistence.** Evaluate the amount of time you think you’ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.

When we use this [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] of evaluating a career path, it can help frame what is possible and elucidate options which I may not have considered in the first place. This can help frame the 'Reality Box' of possible career options in front of me.
