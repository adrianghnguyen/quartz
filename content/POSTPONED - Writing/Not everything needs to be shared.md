# It's okay to keep some personal information private.

A person can be honest while not sharing all information. Being dishonest, or misleading is more about hiding the truth to misrepresent a situation - something [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|heyPI]] is teaching me.

Here are some things I can tell myself in terms of [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]] when I feel like I am not being genuine by not sharing all the details:
- "I am honest and transparent, even when I don't share every detail."
- "Honesty is more than [[Oversharing creates discomfort|just saying everything]] - itâ€™s about being genuine and authentic."

I guess wanting to maintain some things to myself is a form of [[Setting healthy boundaries in relationships to make us happy|personal boundary]] and is a way of [[Self-respect|respecting myself]]. [[Emotional vulnerability needs to be invited|Emotional vulnerability]] and the sharing of information is a [[Good communication requires effortful engagement|two-way street]]. They're not entitled to know everything about me.

## My personal struggles with differentiation honesty, authenticity and maintaining privacy

I have a hard time with [[Be succinct when communicating|being succinct]] with others. Sometimes, I just feel like [[Oversharing creates discomfort|I share too much information]] and I feel like it puts me in a weaker bargaining position or it makes me feel like a [[Honest communication is clear|dishonest person]] if I don't say everything.

I feel like I have a guilt if I feel like I am lying - when sometimes that may not be the case.
