## Complex structures should emerge from simple systems

Complex structures emerge from combining multiple simple system.

According to Gall's law (system's law), sustainable complex structures and systems emerge from basic and simple interactions. It's essentially saying that if you want to build something complex, it needs to be built from the bottom up. Long story short, complex structures emerge organically.

> Gall's law, also known as the "systems law," states that complex systems evolve from simple systems through a process of accretion. According to this law, complex systems are not designed but emerge gradually as new components are added over time. Gall's law emphasizes the importance of simplicity in system design, as complex systems can be difficult to understand and maintain. It suggests that starting with a simple system and adding components only when necessary can lead to more effective and manageable solutions.

Large ships can steer the course, but details should be left to the ground crew who have probably a better understanding of the operational basis of what needs to be done. I believe this is a principle that's also given by the U.S. Army in terms of providing initiative to the individual unit.

I believe that good management is about resolving information asymmetry that exists between the top level and what is the bottom level. It's important that everyone stays aligned, and I believe that morale gets broken when those things start deviating or some management is out of touch.
