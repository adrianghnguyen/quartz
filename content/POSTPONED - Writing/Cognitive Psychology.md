## What is cognitive psychology

> [Cognitive psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology) is the scientific study of [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|mental processes]] such as attention, language use, memory, perception, problem solving, creativity, and reasoning. New school of thought differing from **behaviorism** which stated that [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|mental processes]] were *outside of empirical science*, as they were unobservable.

Sounds a lot like people who believe [[Consciousness is the state of being aware and alive|consciousness]] cannot be studied using artificial intelligence or rather the nature of our thoughts cannot be studied using machines ([[Machine Learning]]) or computer science [[Algorithms|algorithms]]. I believe that at the end of the day, with our mind-body connection ([[Mind-body connection]]), we're just sacks of meat respond to stimuli. Like particles having clear cause and effect in interaction. If we don't understand it - we need to dig deeper and [[Curiosity as my worldview|fundamentally ask why]].

This is partially challenged by the TOTE model ([[Test and learn until the objective is achieved]]) and its associated criticismsâ€¦but I think it's good enough as a mental model ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]])
