> In a recent announcement at the F8 conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg revealed that the company is moving away from its famous motto "Move fast and break things." The new motto, "Move fast with stable infrastructure," reflects Facebook's shift towards a more mature approach focused on stability and reliability. Zuckerberg acknowledged that in their earlier days, they would tolerate bugs in order to move quickly, but as the company has grown, fixing bugs has become a hindrance to progress. This change demonstrates Facebook's maturation and their commitment to providing a reliable platform for developers.
