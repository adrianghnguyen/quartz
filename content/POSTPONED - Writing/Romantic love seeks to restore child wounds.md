In relationships, we often experience disillusionment and disappointment when the initial excitement fades away and we realize that our partners have qualities that bother us.

However, when we recreate these patterns, we may criticize our partners for possessing qualities that we lack. It is important to understand these dynamics in order to navigate relationships effectively and improve [[Best practices for handling relationship conflicts|conflicts in the relationships]].

It's interesting because what initially attracted us to our partner also often becomes a [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|source of conflict in the relationship]]. But [[Conflicts in relationships are normal|conflict in relationships is normal]].
