## Economic warfare

[https://youtu.be/btF6nKHo2i0](https://youtu.be/btF6nKHo2i0) socialism has often been interfered with by capitalist nations. I'll be writing something soon but economics is deeply intertwined with politics. We can think of politics as society's bias towards policies which includes economics.

War is a political act and thus it is impacted by economics and the states desire for power projection. Physically this can be represented by aircraft carriers but to an extent with debt trap fallacy, intellectual property and ownership of technology and outsourcing is a form of economic power projection.

Clausewitz being reductive get here states that war is a tool of state hood. See As a theorist, Carl Von Clausewitz is often reduced to his dictum that “war is a continuation of politics by other means,” (pp. 280). [https://warroom.armywarcollege.edu/articles/grand-strategy-clausewitz/](https://warroom.armywarcollege.edu/articles/grand-strategy-clausewitz/)

If you really want to see this played out, see the Ukraine and and Russian war and the use of gas supplies as an economic tool

To understand economics is to understand politics. And war is a political act. See confessions of an economic hitman and the US army fm5 on planning and political act. Conversely using propositional logic, business is the economics of warfare. Under this principle, we can learn to apply a lot of the strategies on competition over zero sum resources. That's why a lot of business leaders are told to read the art of war.

## Debt-trap fallacy

China through its belt and road strategy is currently using this method as economic warfare. They are currently propping up a lot of infrastructure in Africa. A lot of those countries are reaching resources and minerals, but they may not be able to repay back all this infrastructure. If the default, China would be in a strong economic position of leverage which can be in turn converted into military power.

I wonder if, on the long term, strongarming countries like this does backfire? Nations like people tend to have long memories and it can become engrained in society. [[Generational trauma|Generational Trauma]] would live onto the voting populace which would influence future political decisions.

> [!ai] AI - Economic Warfare: The Fallacy of the Debt Trap
> Economic warfare is a term used to describe a strategy that countries use to gain an economic advantage over their rivals. Countries use various tactics to achieve this, including imposing tariffs, manipulating currency, and using sanctions. One of the most controversial tactics used in economic warfare is the debt trap.
>
> The debt trap fallacy is the idea that a country can be trapped into debt by another country or institution. This idea suggests that if a country borrows too much money from another country or institution, it will become dependent on that lender and will eventually be unable to repay its debt. This can lead to severe economic consequences for the debtor country, including inflation, high interest rates, and even default.
>
> While it is true that excessive borrowing can lead to economic problems for countries, the debt trap fallacy oversimplifies the complex relationships between lenders and borrowers. In reality, countries borrow money for various reasons, including financing infrastructure projects or responding to unforeseen crises. Borrowing can also help countries grow their economies by providing funding for education and skills development.
>
> Furthermore, not all lenders are created equal. Some lenders have strict conditions attached to their loans, while others offer more flexible terms. Countries have a responsibility to carefully assess the risks associated with borrowing and choose lenders that offer terms that are favorable to their long-term interests.
>
> Ultimately, the debt trap fallacy ignores the fact that countries have agency in their own economic destinies. While there are certainly risks associated with borrowing too much money from other countries or institutions, it is possible for countries to manage these risks effectively through responsible borrowing practices and careful analysis of potential lenders.
>
> In conclusion, while economic warfare is a real phenomenon with serious consequences for countries around the world, it is important not to fall prey to simplistic ideas like the debt trap fallacy. Instead, policymakers should focus on developing strategies that promote sustainable growth and provide opportunities for all countries to participate in the global economy on equal footing.
