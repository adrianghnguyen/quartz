## Science of falling in love

Humans build [[The need to belong is the root of social connection|social connections]] which leads to a sense of wholeness. This sense of wholeness come from an intrinsic lace as well as the connections we form with our friends, family and our **partners** who are our *attachment objects*. This is related to our [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|attachment process]] to see how we approach or move away when our [[Attachment behaviours are how we form trust|trust]] is impaired or improved.

We engage in certain types of behaviours such as:
1. Proximity seeking
2. Safe haven
3. Separation distress
4. Secure base

## Behavioral markers of the attachment process

### Proximity seeking

We want to be connected to the other person so we engaged in the following [[One Emotional Ring as our emotional center|core processes of emotional ring]]:

- Feels good to be around them -- *enjoying*
- Want to be as close to them as possible -- *eagerness*

In the context of romantic relationships, this behavior to include wanting to be around them constantly, messaging them, leaving work early to see your partner, etc.

### Safe haven

When things go poorly in our life, such as periods of stressful moments, we want to get closer to them by telling them everything about it and seek their emotional support.

> In adult relationships, it’s the phone call to your partner after a long, hard day at work. When your stress response is activated, your attachment mechanism says, “Soothe your stress by connecting with your attachment object.” This is the “tend and befriend” dynamic, which I’ll talk about more later.

### Separation distress

When we are away from this person, we feel physical pain aka missing the person. It is the [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|loneliness]] we feel when we are physically away from someone.

See also [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships]] to understand the anxious style of attachment which is characterized by this behaviour.

### Secure base

This place or person is your emotional home. It is where we feel safe. When we are separated from this emotional home, despite perhaps being in our physical one, we might feel separation distress.

> Any adult who has come home from a business trip and fallen onto the couch next to a partner, to hold hands and make eye contact while talking about what happened while they were separated, has experienced this.
