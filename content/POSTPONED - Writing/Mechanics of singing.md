# The mechanics of singing

[[2023-02-05 Sun]] [[Justin Li]] was teaching me about the physical properties behind singing. I was sharing a video about Taeyeon in this song [MAX CHANGMIN, TAEYEON, WINTER 'Priority' Stage Video - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY-Dgpwthe8). I commented that she has an absolutely beautiful voice and they started explaining about how harmonic frequencies relate to singing.

They commented that she has an extremely resonant voice - possessing lots of high frequency harmonics which resonate.

> [!summary] TL;DR of resonance as explained by [[Justin Li]]
> "Resonance is when a harmonic from the vocal folds lines up with the pitch of the air (formant) in the vocal tract. The harmonic is boosted and gains volume. It is re -sounded, or resonated.Â "

Trying it on your own

the vocal chords vibrate and produce energy that vibrates the entire vocal tract and the air in it

you can actually hear resonance without pitch

if you make like a hissing sound

and open and close your mouth

you can hear how the sound changes

hissing from the back of your throat not your tongue
