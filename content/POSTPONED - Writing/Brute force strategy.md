> Brute force strategy is a straightforward approach used in problem-solving and computer algorithms. It involves systematically trying all possible solutions to find the correct one. This strategy ignores any shortcuts or optimizations and instead relies on sheer computing power and exhaustive search. While it guarantees finding a solution, it can be time-consuming and inefficient for larger problem sizes.
