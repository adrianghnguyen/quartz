## Energy gels

When performing endurance sports such as [[My love for cycling|cycling]], it's important to consume enough carbs. One of the primary methods to do so is to consumer sugar which is a mix of fructose and glucose molecules in a 1:1 ratio.

A lot of people rely on energy gels, but they're simply different ratio mixes of this. It could be expensive to consume that many energy gels so I would prefer opting for a homemade solution as outlined [this video by Jesse Coyle](https://youtu.be/vT-PBsSLX3U)

If one doesn't consume enough carbs, we can expect a performance drop off after a while as the body switches energy consumption methods. I need to do more research on what this means exactly.

### Homemade recipe for energy gel

1. Measure 100g of sugar
2. Measure water into flask (slightly below max fill)
3. Combine sugar and water on stovetop to dissolve
4. Wait to cool
5. Pour back mixture into soft flask

### Common energy gel ingredients

> Below are some popular sugars in energy gels with a bit of explanation and links to helpful resources:
>
> -   [Maltodextrin](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/molecule-of-the-week/archive/m/maltodextrin.html) – technically (molecularly) speaking it is a polysaccharide, or in other words a chain of glucose molecules ranging in length from 3 to 17 glucose pre chain. More [practically speaking](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322426#what-is-maltodextrin) it is a white powder substance that serves as a food additive that improves texture, taste and shelf life — and in the case of energy gels provides energy that helps us go beyond the limits of the energy stores in our muscles and liver. This [article from energy gel maker SIS](https://www.scienceinsport.com/au/sports-nutrition/2018/02/21/carb-conundrum-understanding-glucose-fructose-vs-sis-maltodextrin/) explains the rationale of why they include it as the primary source of sugar in their products.

> -    Dextrose/Glucose – [dextrose](https://www.webmd.com/diet/what-to-know-dextrose) and glucose are often used interchangeably. Glucose is the simple (single molecule) sugar that is found in your blood stream, and dextrose is molecularly very similar. Dextrose can be quickly digested and replenishes your energy in a very short time. It is not as sweet as sucrose (table sugar) and can also extend the shelf life of processed foods such as energy gels.
>
> -    Fructose – also known as [“Fruit Sugar”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose) is another form of simple sugar derived as the name implies from fruits, as well as from starchy veggies, beets, cane, and honey. [Gu Energy Labs](https://guenergy.com/blogs/nutrition-lab/sugar-and-its-role-in-endurance-sports) do a good job describing why adding fructose to energy gels can help during endurance sports. Essentially it is due to the fact that fructose uses a totally different protein transporter than glucose – allowing for faster delivery of energy throughout your body. Fructose is also sweet and used as a taste enhancer.
>
> -    Cane Syrup, Maple Syrup, Honey – these are [sugars derived or harvested from nature](https://spoonuniversity.com/lifestyle/honey-vs-maple-syrup-which-is-healthier-for-you) and are sometimes used as gel substitutes or flavor/energy additives to energy gels. Cane and maple syrups primarily contain sucrose while honey is loaded with fructose which also makes it the sweetest of the three.
>
> -    Fruit or Rice – [some energy gel makers](https://myspringenergy.com/) that cater to the “all natural” consumers use ingredients such as rice or pureed fruit as the main source of sugar. These ingredients will contain starches (more complex carbohydrates) as well as sugars such as sucrose and fructose. 100g of banana for example will contain 2.1g of sucrose , 7g of glucose, and 6.7g of fructose according to the [USDA nutrient database](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/fdc-app.html#/food-details/1105073/nutrients).

## Consume between 60-140g of carbs per hour

Recent studies shows that we should be consuming between 60-140g depending on intensity of exercise, level of training as well as GI stomach adaptability.

After the [[Defi metropolitain]], I feel like I could benefit from a higher amount of carbs per hour. I may need to push myself to 100g of energy

## Composition of sugar

Sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, is composed of glucose and fructose. It is a disaccharide made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule linked together by a glycosidic bond.
