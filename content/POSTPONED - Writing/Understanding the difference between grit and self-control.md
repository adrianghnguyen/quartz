> In simpler terms, grit and self-control are two traits that help people achieve their goals. Self-control is about resisting the temptation to choose a lower-level goal over a higher-level goal. Grit, on the other hand, is about not giving up on a big goal when faced with obstacles or pursuing multiple big goals one after another. Self-control is linked to everyday success, while grit is more connected to exceptional achievements that may take a long time to accomplish.

> Similarities and differences between grit and related but distinct constructs, such as self-control, are illuminated by a hierarchical goal framework:
>
> Grit entails adhering to a singular superordinate goal and its corresponding lower-level goals and actions, whereas self-control refers to adhering to any goal over any relatively less valued alternative.

> At lower levels of the goal hierarchy, grit and self-control are also distinguished by the modal “enemies” they address. Whereas for the **self-controlled** individual, the modal enemy is **temptation**—a lower-level competing goal in the face of a more valued alternative—the **modal enemies for the gritty individual are obstacles and rival pursuits**. Whereas a failure of self-control entails choosing to satisfy a relatively lower-level temptation over a relatively higher-order goal, a failure of grit more commonly entails giving up on a superordinate goal in the face of obstacles or pursuing a series of superordinate goals in quick succession.

In this paper, they make the following points:
- a failure of self-control is about succumbing to temptations but for grit, it's about giving up the goal to choose an alternative pursuit
- people will less grit will be chasing a series of superordinatoe (high-level priority goals) instead of being single-minded towards a specific objective, such as single pointed [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|career mission]]. There's a single **dominant superordinate goal** which permeates [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|all daily decisions]] and serves as the lens by which one operates their life.
