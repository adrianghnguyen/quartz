# Use little bets to make breakthrough ideas

This concept introduced in the book by the same name, [[Little Bets by Peter Sims|Little Bets by Peter Sims]] that *rather than starting with big ideas* or planning out a whole project in advance, they make a methodical series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning critical information from [[Incremental change|lots of little failures and from small but significant wins]].”

From what I understand, it's to not overly focus on a preconceived outcome but rather learn to [[Test and learn until the objective is achieved|iterate until an objective is achieved]] which requires calculated bets aka [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]].

Innovative ideas don't occur randomly via Eureka moments - but rather occur at the limits of our knowledge which we call the [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|adjacent possible]].

To determine if an idea is worth pursuing, consider the [[Good ideas get paid|Law of financial viability]]. Using this strategy helps me achieve [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]] in which I gain further knowledge, whether it be personal or professional.

## Innovative ideas are not made in isolation
