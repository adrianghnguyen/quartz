> Black or white thinking, also known as polarized thinking or all-or-nothing thinking, is a cognitive distortion where individuals see things only in extreme terms. They perceive situations, people, or ideas as either entirely good or entirely bad, with no gray area in between.
>
> This type of thinking often leads to rigid beliefs, inflexible attitudes, and limited perspectives. It can hinder problem-solving, decision-making, and interpersonal relationships.
