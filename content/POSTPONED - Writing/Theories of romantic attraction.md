# Mental models of romantic attraction

Harville Hendrix explains why we are attracted to certain people and summarizes the theories of romantic attraction by presenting [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|various attraction models]].

1. Biological Theory: People tend to choose mates who increase the likelihood of their offspring's survival. This theory suggests that men are attracted to beauty and fertility (such as young age), while women are attracted to alpha qualities. It is recommended to read _[The Selfish Gene](https://thepowermoves.com/the-selfish-gene-summary/)_ and _[The Moral Animal](https://thepowermoves.com/the-moral-animal-summary/)_ for further understanding.
2. Social Exchange Theory: According to social psychology, individuals are more likely to choose partners who are similar to themselves. This theory is supported by various studies. For more information, refer to [The Social Exchange Rule](https://thepowermoves.com/the-social-exchange-theory/) and [Social Exchange Theory: 5 Laws of Social Success](https://thepowermoves.com/the-social-exchange-theory/).
3. Persona Theory: The concept of persona theory suggests that potential partners contribute to our self-esteem and we tend to choose mates who make us look good. This theory is further discussed in [how to have perennial high self-esteem](https://thepowermoves.com/the-antifragile-ego/).

## We seek partners who resemble our parents

1. The Unconscious Drives Us Back to The Caregiver: Harville Hendrix adds the theory that our unconscious mind drives us towards partners who resemble our caregivers. This observation has been repeatedly seen in therapy sessions.
