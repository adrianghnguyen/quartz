When making decisions, the process of making choices, it should be informed by reliable and accurate information. To do so, we need to [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gather information]]

Various types of [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] to help us make better decisions.

Having access to mental frameworks allows us to transfer from [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]] to type 1 thinking and integrate it into our habit. That means that we can lower the overhead of cognitive resources when we need to make difficult decisions by recalling information rather than synthesizing things which requires a lot of [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive overhead]].

> Informed decision-making refers to the process of making choices based on reliable and accurate information. It involves gathering relevant data, analyzing it, and considering [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|different perspectives or alternatives]] before coming to a conclusion. Informed decision-making enables individuals or organizations to weigh the pros and cons, evaluate potential risks, and make choices that are rational and well-informed. It is crucial for effective problem-solving, strategic planning, and achieving desired outcomes.

## High-stake decisions

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> When determining criteria for a high-stake decision, consider the following steps:
> 1. Identify the objectives: Clearly define the desired outcomes or objectives of the decision. This helps in aligning the criteria with the overall goals.
> 2. Gather relevant information: Collect all necessary data and information related to the decision. This may include market research, financial analysis, expert opinions, or any other relevant sources.
> 3. Brainstorm potential criteria: Engage stakeholders and decision-makers to generate a list of possible criteria that can be used to evaluate different options. Consider both qualitative and quantitative factors.
> 4. Prioritize criteria: Assess the importance of each criterion by considering its relevance to the objectives, potential impact on outcomes, and any trade-offs involved. Rank or weight the criteria accordingly.
> 5. Define measurable indicators: Convert qualitative criteria into quantifiable indicators wherever possible. This allows for objective evaluation and comparison of different options against each criterion.
> 6. Set thresholds or benchmarks: Determine minimum or maximum values for certain indicators that must be met for an option to be considered acceptable. This helps in distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable choices.
> 7. Consider uncertainties and risks: Evaluate potential uncertainties or risks associated with each criterion and their impact on decision-making. Adjust weights or thresholds if needed to account for these uncertainties.
> 8. Test and validate criteria: Review the selected criteria against real-life scenarios or case studies to ensure they are feasible, practical, and aligned with the organization's values and policies.
> 9. Seek consensus: Involve key stakeholders in the process of defining criteria to ensure their buy-in and support for the decision-making process.
> 10. Review and update regularly: Regularly review and update the criteria as new information becomes available or circumstances change to ensure they remain relevant and appropriate over time.
> By following these steps, you can establish well-defined criteria that help in making informed high-stake decisions effectively.

> Determining whether a decision is high-stakes involves evaluating the potential impact of the outcome on various factors, such as finances, reputation, safety, and long-term goals. Here's some concrete advice to help identify high-stakes decisions:
>
> 1. **Potential Consequences:** Assess the potential consequences of the decision. If the outcome could significantly impact your financial stability, personal or professional reputation, or the well-being of individuals involved, it's likely a high-stakes decision.
> 2. **Irreversible Effects:** Consider whether the decision is reversible or irreversible. High-stakes decisions often involve irreversible consequences, making it crucial to thoroughly evaluate options before proceeding.
> 3. **Resource Commitment:** Evaluate the resources (financial, time, personnel) required for the decision. If a substantial commitment of resources is needed, the decision likely carries higher stakes.
> 4. **Long-Term Impact:** Examine the potential long-term impact on your goals and objectives. Decisions with lasting implications are generally high-stakes.
> 5. **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Determine whether legal or ethical considerations are at play. Decisions involving legal ramifications or ethical dilemmas often have higher stakes due to potential legal liabilities or damage to reputation.
> 6. **Risk Assessment:** Conduct a risk assessment to identify potential pitfalls and challenges associated with each option. High-stakes decisions often involve greater risk and require careful risk management.
> 7. **Input from Stakeholders:** Gather input from relevant stakeholders. If multiple parties are invested in the outcome, it's likely a decision with higher stakes.
> 8. **Emotional Impact:** Consider the emotional impact of the decision on yourself and others. High-stakes decisions can evoke strong emotions due to the weight of the potential outcomes.
> 9. **Timing:** Assess the urgency of the decision. If a decision needs to be made quickly and has significant implications, it may be high-stakes.
> 10. **[[History is a good teacher|Precedents: Research similar situations and their outcomes to understand the potential impact of your decision. Precedents can provide insights into the stakes involved.]]**
>
> In summary, high-stakes decisions are those with the potential to significantly affect finances, reputation, safety, and long-term goals, often involving irreversible consequences and substantial resource commitments. They also tend to carry legal, ethical, and emotional considerations. Thoroughly evaluating these factors will help you identify whether a decision is high-stakes or not.
