## What is deep work?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Deep work is a concept popularized by author and professor Cal Newport in his book "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World." It refers to the ability to focus without distraction on cognitively demanding tasks. In a world filled with constant distractions, deep work is becoming increasingly rare but is highly valuable. It involves immersing oneself in a state of flow and concentration for extended periods to produce high-quality work. Deep work is characterized by uninterrupted, undistracted, and intensive focus on a single task or skill.
