I'd like to surround myself with people who can share [[High performance requires these personal values|aspirations for high performance and help along my personal growth]].

I would like for them to be those who choose to walk their own [[Living a noble life according to Buddhism|noble path]]. When it comes to my [[Choose social circles wisely|social circles]], I want them to make the world a better place in their own little ways.
