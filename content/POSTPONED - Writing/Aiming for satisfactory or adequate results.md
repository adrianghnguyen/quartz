> Satisficing is a decision-making strategy that aims for a satisfactory or adequate result, rather than the optimal solution. This is often used when the cost or effort of finding the perfect solution is too high. The term was introduced by American economist and Nobel laureate Herbert Simon in 1956.

When it comes to [[Career decision-making|career decisions]], it's important to not jump the gun and make a [[Make quick and decisive actions|hasty decision]] but instead carefully consider options. We want to make a decision which is [[Make informed decisions|well-informed]].

## Stop researching and move into action when your best guess stops changing

A good heuristic for when we should stop researching and [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|just try something out]] according to [[The organization 80 000 hours|The organization 80 000 hours]] is when **our best guess stops changing**. Another way of thinking about it is when a lot of decisions seem to be converging on the same answer, or at least within the same decision space.

I guess this explains why [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|accepting change in life]] is so important. Each set of experiment brings us one step closer in learning more about what [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|we want in life]]. Something to think about when I think about what [[My ideal life|what I want out of life]].

I guess that can be tough since the human brain seems to be [[Hedonic treadmill as a metaphor for never being satisfied|never satisfied]] as it is [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|constantly thinking about the future]] and seeking better alternatives.

## Personal thoughts

I think it can be easy for me to avoid [[Make quick and decisive actions|taking quick and decisive action]] due to overthinking things and suffering from [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]]. With that being said, when it comes to making career decisions, it can be worth it to take the time to take a measured and calculated approach to make an [[Make informed decisions|informed decision]]. At least that's part of the advice given by [[The organization 80 000 hours|80,000 Hours]].
