## Deep neural networks

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Deep neural networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. They are composed of multiple layers of interconnected artificial neurons, also known as nodes or units. Each neuron takes in input data, applies a mathematical transformation to it, and passes the result to the next layer of neurons. Through a process called training, deep neural networks can learn to recognize patterns and make predictions from large datasets. They have been successfully applied to various tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
