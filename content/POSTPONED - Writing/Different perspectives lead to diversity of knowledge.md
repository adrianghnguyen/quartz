He provides examples of successful individuals who have thrived in diverse roles due to their ability to think outside traditional disciplinary boundaries.

[[Range by David Epstein|David Epstein]] discusses how organizations can benefit from fostering generalist cultures. He argues that teams composed of diverse individuals with varied backgrounds and skill sets are more innovative and adaptable in rapidly changing industries.
