Related to [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning]]

We should self-test our knowledge often in order to improve information recall. Test what you know often.

One of the best ways to learn information is through space repetition.  This means that we often need to test what we know by asking ourselves questions and see how much of it we can produce ourselves. This forces the brain to try and recall information and strengthens the neural connections. We should do this as often as possible.
