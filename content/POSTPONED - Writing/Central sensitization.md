>
> Central sensitization is a phenomenon that occurs when the central nervous system (CNS) becomes hypersensitive to pain signals. This can lead to chronic pain conditions, such as [[Fibromyalgia]], chronic fatigue syndrome, and irritable bowel syndrome.
>
> Central sensitization occurs when there is an increase in the sensitivity of the CNS neurons that transmit pain signals. This can be triggered by various factors, such as tissue injury, inflammation, or nerve damage.
>
> The increased sensitivity of the CNS neurons causes them to respond excessively to even mild or non-painful stimuli. This leads to a state of heightened pain sensitivity and can result in chronic pain conditions.
>
> Central sensitization is not just limited to physical factors. Psychological factors such as stress, [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] or depression can also trigger it.
>
> Treatment for central sensitization involves both pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Medications such as analgesics and antidepressants may be prescribed to manage the symptoms. Non-pharmacological approaches include physical therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and relaxation techniques
>
> It is important to recognize central sensitization early on and seek appropriate treatment in order to prevent it from becoming a chronic condition.
