# Anchors are repeated activities and events which occur in our daily life

#status/postponed

To [[Creating effective habits|create effective habits]], we need to recognize the importance of anchor events in our daily lives. These can take the example of brushing our teeth, walking to work. They serve as [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|memory aids]] on which we can build our [[Rituals and routines are important to develop good habits|key habits into our daily routine]].

We can think of it as being a [[Priming effects|primer for the stimulus event]].

> [!NOTE] Anchors for habits
> Anchors are repeated activities that happen in your daily life, like brushing your teeth or walking to work. Fogg suggests that the desired habit be executed before, or in conjunction with, an anchor. For instance, if you want to become stronger by doing push-ups, do five push-ups before brushing your teeth (the anchor). This ensures that the anchor triggers the activity and makes it repeatable.

## Creating effective habits require daily anchor events

BJ Fogg suggests that habits should coincide with 'anchors'. Long story short, we should have something which our habits are centered around which can serve as [[Use memory aids to recall information more easily|memory aids]] to reinforce our [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|good habits]].

Essentially, we find a key habit or behaviour to become a bedrock for further habits to be built upon. Like having a strong base for a sandcastle then adding on top of it. It's a pivot point which can serve as a lifeline on which we can rotate.

Changing our behaviour requires us to contemplate and go through multiple steps, which is further explained within the [[Stages involved in behavioral change|Stages of behavioral change model]].
