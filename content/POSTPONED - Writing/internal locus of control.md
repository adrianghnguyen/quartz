# Internal locus of control

#status/postponed

---

An internal locus of control is a psychological concept that refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the situations and experiences that affect their lives. Those with a strong internal locus of control believe that their own actions and decisions directly influence their outcomes. They feel in control of their own destiny, often leading to increased confidence and motivation. Conversely, an external locus of control means individuals believe their lives are largely influenced by external factors or luck.
