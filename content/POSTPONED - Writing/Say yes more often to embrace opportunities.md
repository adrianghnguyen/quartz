> In the research conducted by University of Chicago economist Steven Levitt, he has found that when people are faced with difficult life decisions that they struggle to make, flipping a coin can lead to increased happiness. Levitt asks individuals to think about their hardest decisions and then make the decision based on a coin flip, where heads represents a scary commitment and tails represents the safe route. Surprisingly, he discovers that over time, those who choose heads and make the commitment are happier than those who choose tails. It is important to note that this research does not suggest gambling with one's life, but rather highlights the idea that saying yes in life can lead to greater happiness.
