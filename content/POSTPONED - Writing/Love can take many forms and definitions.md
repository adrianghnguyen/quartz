Love is not just an expression of feeling, but it's also a feeling of generosity towards another person or even yourself, according to your ability and [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|unique experience]]. In a way, [[Love is shown through actions|love is an action]].

It would be important to reflect and think about how the multiple ways I can nurture this in my life. Perhaps it's learning to [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|appreciate my body]], [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|accepting myself]].

Love is a complicated matter - with many philosophers seeking to elucidate on the subject yet it is ephemeral. [[Greek names for the various types of love|The Greeks sought to dissect the concept by classifying the types of loves we may experience]]. It is more than [[Difference between love and affection|mere affection]].

We breathe and bask in it, but we cannot seem to convey the depths of our compassion to the others who mean so much to us as well as [[Recognizing interconnectivity leads to worldly empathy|respecting their connection to us]]. Perhaps it's a way of [[Create trust in order to build an emotional connection|building connection and trust]] and a deepening sense of intimacy with others.

We don't really understand it, and there are many [[Common cultural myths about love|misconceptions about love]].

## True love is not rooted in a place of want

> Love is really caring about the well-being of another person independent of my own needs, that I really want you to thrive independent of what's happening with me right now, that that is a real selfless form of love, and that what we find is that when people get more involved in wanting to foster other people's well-being, they get happier.

### Paradox of love

> [!quote] Paradox of love

> One of the great paradoxes of love is that our most transcendental need is for people who, in a worldly sense, we do not need at all. If you are lucky, and work toward deepening your relationships, you’ll soon find that you have a [[Meaningful relationships are based on altruistic love|real friend]] or two to whom you can pay the highest compliment: “I don’t need you—I simply love you.”

> The paradox of love refers to the contradictory nature of love and the challenges it presents. Love is often seen as a positive and fulfilling emotion, associated with happiness and fulfillment. However, it can also bring about pain, vulnerability, and heartbreak.
> One aspect of the paradox of love is the idea that love requires vulnerability. When we love someone, we open ourselves up to the possibility of being hurt or rejected. Love involves trusting another person with our emotions and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable in their presence. This vulnerability can lead to feelings of fear and anxiety, as we may worry about being hurt or abandoned.
> Furthermore, love can also create a sense of dependency. When we love someone deeply, we may become emotionally reliant on them for our happiness and well-being. This reliance can lead to feelings of insecurity and fear of losing the person we love.
> Another aspect of the paradox of love is the notion that it can bring both joy and pain. Love can bring immense happiness and fulfillment when it is reciprocated and nurtured. However, it can also result in heartbreak, disappointment, and sadness when it is not reciprocated or when conflicts arise in the relationship.
> Finally, the paradox of love lies in its ability to simultaneously unite and divide people. Love has the power to bring individuals together, creating strong bonds and connections between them. However, it can also create divisions between people, leading to conflicts, jealousy, and competition.
> In conclusion, the paradox of love highlights the contradictory nature of this complex emotion. While love can bring happiness and fulfillment, it also comes with vulnerability, pain, dependency, and potential division. Despite these challenges, many still view love as an essential part of human existence that is worth pursuing despite its paradoxical nature.
