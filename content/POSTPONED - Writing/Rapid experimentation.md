> Rapid experimentation refers to the process of quickly testing and iterating on ideas, products, or processes to gather data and learn from the results. It involves taking small, incremental steps to validate assumptions and gain insights, rather than relying on long, time-consuming planning and implementation.
>
> Continuous feedback, on the other hand, is the practice of regularly collecting input, suggestions, and criticism from stakeholders, customers, or team members throughout the experimentation process. It involves seeking feedback at various stages of development to make improvements and ensure that the final outcome meets expectations.

> Together, rapid experimentation and continuous feedback create a dynamic and [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative approach]] to problem-solving and innovation. By quickly trying out different ideas and gathering feedback along the way, organizations can [[make informed decisions]] based on real-world data and adapt their strategies accordingly. This iterative cycle allows for faster learning, more efficient use of resources, and ultimately better outcomes.
