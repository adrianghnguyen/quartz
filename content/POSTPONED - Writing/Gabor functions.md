## Gabor functions in vision processing

A new approach to vision is supported by Gabor's theory of communication but seems inconclusive in terms of achieving a global theory of vision.

> Gabor showed how to represent time-varying signals in terms of functions that are localized in both time and frequency (the functions in time are represented by the product of a Gaussian and a sinusoid). These functions, now referred to as Gabor functions, have been used to describe the behavior of cortical simple cells that extend in both space and spatial frequency. However, the approach provides no further insight into why cortical neurons might behave in this way.

> Gabor’s theory implies that one can also represent the [visual] information in terms of the amplitudes of functions that are localized in both space and frequency.

## Gabor filter in image processing

> In image processing, a Gabor filter, named after Dennis Gabor, who first proposed it as a 1D filter.[1] The Gabor filter was first generalized to 2D by Gösta Granlund,[2] by adding a reference direction. The Gabor filter is a linear filter used for texture analysis, which essentially means that it analyzes whether there is *any specific frequency content in the image in specific directions in a localized region around the point or region of analysis.* Frequency and orientation representations of Gabor filters are claimed by many contemporary vision scientists to be similar to those of the **human visual system.**[3] They have been found to be particularly **appropriate for texture representation and discrimination**. In the spatial domain, a 2D Gabor filter is a Gaussian kernel function modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave (see Gabor transform).
>
> Some authors claim that simple cells in the visual cortex of mammalian brains can be modeled by Gabor functions.[4][5] Thus, image analysis with Gabor filters is thought by some to be similar to perception in the human visual system.^[Wikipedia]

- They're related to Gabor wavelets

## Frequency selectivity in Gabor codes

> Frequency selectivity in Gabor codes refers to the ability of Gabor filters to detect and respond to specific spatial frequencies in an image. Spatial frequencies correspond to patterns or details within an image, where high spatial frequencies represent fine details (such as sharp edges or thin lines) and low spatial frequencies represent broader features (such as smooth regions or gradual changes in color).
>
> Gabor filters are designed to be selective to a particular spatial frequency by adjusting their parameters, such as the frequency (f0) of the sinusoidal plane wave and the standard deviation (σ) of the Gaussian envelope function.
>
> The frequency (f0) parameter determines the frequency of the sinusoidal plane wave within the Gabor filter, which in turn determines the frequency that the filter is most sensitive to. A Gabor filter with a higher frequency (f0) value will be more responsive to finer details in an image, while a lower frequency (f0) value will respond to coarser features.
>
> The standard deviation (σ) of the Gaussian envelope function controls the "width" or "scale" of the filter. A larger σ value results in a broader Gaussian function, which means the filter will be more responsive to lower spatial frequencies. Conversely, a smaller σ value results in a narrower Gaussian function, making the filter more sensitive to higher spatial frequencies.
>
> In practice, to capture the full range of spatial frequencies present in an image, a set of Gabor filters with different frequency and scale parameters is used. This collection of filters, often called a filter bank, can be applied to the image to produce a set of filtered images, each highlighting a particular spatial frequency and orientation. The combination of these filtered images can then be used for various image processing and computer vision tasks, such as texture analysis, edge detection, and pattern recognition.
>
> In summary, frequency selectivity in Gabor codes refers to the capability of Gabor filters to detect and respond to specific spatial frequencies in an image by adjusting their parameters. By using a filter bank with a range of frequency and scale values, Gabor filters can effectively analyze and represent a wide variety of image features.

If I understand correctly, this seems to be a higher dimensionality representation as opposed to a linear/more binary type of frequency sensitivity represented by [[Fourier transform|Fourier transforms]]

## What are Gaussian envelopes?

> [!ai] AI
>
> A Gaussian mixture is a set of possibilities for a distribution, based on a set of initial data. The Gaussian mixture is then used to create a distribution.

### Wy are gausssian distributions useful?

> [!ai] AI
>
> There is no definitive answer, as the distribution of Gaussian functions is still an open question. However, some experts believe that the Gaussian function is a necessary condition for successful function discovery and application. Additionally, the Gaussian distribution may be a tool for measuring the performance of Function Theory algorithms.

### Gabor codes explained simply

> Gabor codes are a mathematical concept used to analyze and represent images or signals, especially for recognizing patterns and textures. They are named after the Hungarian-born physicist and inventor Dennis Gabor, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1971.
>
>  In simple terms, imagine you're looking at a beautiful painting or photograph. To analyze or understand this image, you might want to break it down into smaller pieces that highlight different aspects of it, like the colors, shapes, and patterns. Gabor codes help us do that for images and signals.
>
>  Imagine Gabor codes as a set of tiny, different shaped "glasses" or filters that help you focus on specific parts of the image. These filters are sensitive to different features like edges, lines, and patterns. When you look at the image through these filters, you'll see various aspects of it more clearly, and you can represent the image as a collection of these filtered views.
>
>  Now, let's contrast Gabor codes with other related mathematical concepts, such as Fourier Transform and Wavelets.
>
>  Fourier Transform is like a language that allows you to describe a complex image or signal in terms of simpler, basic building blocks called sine and cosine waves. Imagine you have a song, and you want to break it down into its individual notes. The Fourier Transform would help you identify these notes and their frequencies, allowing you to represent the whole song as a collection of these simple elements.
>
>  Wavelets, on the other hand, are like a blend of Gabor codes and Fourier Transform. They are also a set of mathematical functions or filters that help you analyze and represent images and signals, but they do so at different scales and frequencies. Imagine wavelets as different-sized "magnifying glasses" that allow you to focus on both the big picture and the fine details of an image or signal at the same time.
>
>  In summary, Gabor codes are like special filters that help you analyze images and signals by focusing on specific features like edges, lines, and patterns. They are different from Fourier Transform, which breaks down images and signals into simpler building blocks, and Wavelets, which provide a multi-scale representation of images and signals.

## What is Gabor's theory of communication?

> [!ai] AI
>
> Gabor's theory of communication holds that statistics of natural images can better predict the properties of cortical cells due to their reliance on communication between their surroundings.
