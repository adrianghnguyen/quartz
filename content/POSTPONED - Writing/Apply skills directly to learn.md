Related to [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning]]

This is the principle of directness of [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning|ultralearning]]. Just [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|do the thing]]. The best way of learning is to dive right into the subject and apply ourselves to get [[Learn from your past experiences|direct experience]]. It's about getting as close as possible to applying the skill directly in the world aka getting real-world application of skills.

For example, if we want to get better at writing, we could learn everything we could about writing through articles and books. We get better at doing something by actually doing it directly. Go apply skills directly. It encourages [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplasticity]].

> Consider the situation/context where you want to apply your learning. Then, plunge right in and acquire hands-on experience by learning to do the tasks in a similar situation. Donâ€™t settle for other convenient or comfortable activities.
