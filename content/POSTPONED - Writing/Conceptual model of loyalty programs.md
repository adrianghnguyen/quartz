## Conceptual model of loyalty programs

[Effects of Loyalty Programs on Value Perception, Program Loyalty, and Brand Loyalty - Youjae Yi, Hoseong Jeon, 2003](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0092070303031003002)

> The authors investigate how reward schemes of a loyalty program influence perceived value of the program and how value perception of the loyalty program affects customer loyalty.  The results show that involvement moderates the effects of loyalty programs on customer loyalty.
>
> In high-involvement situations, direct rewards are preferable to indirect rewards. In low-involvement situations, immediate rewards are more effective in building a program’s value than delayed rewards.
>
> Under high-involvement conditions, value perception of the loyalty program influences brand loyalty both directly and indirectly through program loyalty. Under low-involvement conditions, there is no direct effect of value perception on brand loyalty.

- The relationship between loyalty programs and customer loyalty is poorly understood, and many companies fail to properly design and implement effective programs, treating rewards as short-term promotional giveaways.
- The effectiveness of loyalty programs in different markets is understudied, with a focus on packaged-goods markets.
- Previous research has found positive effects of customer satisfaction on loyalty, but little empirical research has explored the mechanisms by which loyalty programs operate.

- High-involvement conditions refers to purchases which require forethought and planning as opposed to a low-involvement condition such as an easy to purchase consumable product which is disposable such as soap.
- Direct rewards are rewards that directly support the value proposition of a given product, whereas indirect rewards refer to incentives that are not relevant to a given product.

> We then conducted the main experiment in a 2 (type of reward: direct vs. indirect) × 2 (timing of reward: immediate vs. delayed) × 2 (involvement: high vs. low) betweensubjects design. 

The experiment used the following framework when presenting college students with a choice:
- High involvement (hair salon) vs low involvement (fried chicken)
- Direct reward (receiving free coupon for hair salon or free chicken) vs indirect reward (CD Player)

Immediate rewards from the experiment was deemed as receiving something in 4 visits or less. Above 10 visits was viewed as a delayed reward.

## Loyal programs systems theory

> [!Info] Review of the theoretical underpinnings of loyalty programs by Conor M Henderson

According to [this paper](https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.02.007) seeking to broaden the research perspective on loyalty programs, most [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|theoretical frameworks]]  in this field are too reductive and fail to consider the holistic system of loyalty programs. It's becoming more important as loyalty program enrollment has now surpassed 1.3 billion people and customers are often 'polygamous' in their loyalty. 

Despite little evidence showing that loyalty programs are effective in driving ROI, with many companies abolishing them, many customers have signed up as well as companies investing much money into establishing such corporate systems.

As a result, they propose taking a [[Dynamic systems theory|dynamic systems theory]] approach by looking at three key factors which operate simultaneously as concurrent [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|psychological processes]]:
1. Status as a loyalty inducing mechanism
2. Habit as a loyalty inducing mechanism
3. Social relationships as a loyalty inducing mechanism

#### Concurrent and simultaneous effect of loyalty programs

According to other research, such mental/social processes can "operate concurrently in an additive manner but different mechanisms may also interact in a multiplicative manner"^[https://foster.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/loyalty-programs-theory.pdf]. They present the concept of  *simultaneous effects of multiple theoretical mechanisms* aka [[Dynamic systems theory|systems theory]] in reference to concurrent psychological responses.

#### Cross-customer effects on loyalty programs

Loyalty programs not only affect the directed targeted party of the loyalty program but also the people outside of it as shopping can be done in social contexts/with companions. Cross-customer loyalty-enhancing relational mechanisms are understudied at the moment.

People may also respond negatively to seeing peers and others receiving superior rewards as it engages psychological mechanisms of exclusion.

#### Temporal effects on loyalty program effectiveness

Most loyalty programs are only evaluated at a single point in time - which fails to take into account temporal effects which may be more subtle to detect. For example, relational-based loyalty invoking gratitude, reciprocating may take a longer time to establish. Single point-in-time analysis may fail to consider long-term effects of on the relationship between customers and the brand.

### Theoretical underpinnings of loyalty programs

Firms should consider moving away from economic utility-based loyalty programs.^[(Kumar & Shah, 2004; Nunes & Dréze, 2006)]

- Loyalty programs which focus on economic utility (discount rewards, price discount, special pricing) fail to generate loyalty as it encourage consumer response to elasticity rather than 'true loyalty' as customers will move to a competitor based on betters deals
- Generating sales by by decreasing price often reduces overall firm profits
- Firms are typically more interesting in creating loyalty programs which tap into creating psychological feedback loops, reducing price sensitivity, increased and repeated purchases, and increase switching barriers (to other firms)

[Review of the theoretical underpinnings of loyalty programs - Henderson - 2011 - Journal of Consumer Psychology - Wiley Online Library](https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.02.007) argues that loyalty program induced changes result from the following three psychological behaviour domains (status, habit, relational):
- (1) conferring status to consumers, which generates favorable comparisons with others
- (2) building habits, which causes advantageous memory processes
- (3) developing relationships, which results in more favorable treatment by consumers

There are constructs which are relevant for loyalty program research, regrouped under broad umbrellas:

- key constructs to status-based loyalty
	- status
	- status conferrals
	- status-enhancement
	- status beliefs
	- costly signals
	- conspicuous consumption
	- [[Social comparison|Social comparison]]
	- Exclusivity
	- Power
- Habit-based loyalty
	- Habits
	- habit strength
	- context stability
	- reminders
	- instrumentality

- relationship-based loyalty
	- relational inputs

	- dependence
	- cohesion

	- trust
