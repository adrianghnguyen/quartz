> Signal integration refers to the process by which multiple signals or inputs are combined to produce a single output or response. It is a fundamental concept in various fields such as mathematics, engineering, and biology. The goal of signal integration is to extract meaningful information from the input signals and make decisions or take actions based on that information. This process involves techniques such as summing, averaging, filtering, and amplifying the signals to achieve the desired outcome. Overall, signal integration plays a crucial role in understanding and manipulating complex systems.
