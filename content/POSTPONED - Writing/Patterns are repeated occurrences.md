# Things repeating become a pattern

## What are patterns?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Patterns are recurring designs or structures that can be observed in various contexts. They can be found in nature, mathematics, art, and many other areas. Patterns can be visual, such as geometric shapes or arrangements of colors, or they can be conceptual, such as repeated sequences or behaviors. Patterns often have a sense of order and repetition, and recognizing and understanding patterns can help in making predictions and solving problems.

## Types of statistical patterns

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> There are several types of statistical patterns that can be observed in data:
> 1. Trend: A trend refers to a long-term movement or pattern in data that shows a consistent increase or decrease over time.
> 2. Seasonality: Seasonality refers to a pattern that repeats itself at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly cycles. For example, retail sales may increase during holiday seasons every year.
> 3. Cyclical: Cyclical patterns are similar to seasonality but occur over longer periods of time. These patterns may not repeat at regular intervals and can last for several years or even decades.
> 4. Random: Random patterns occur when there is no discernible trend, seasonality, or cyclical behavior in the data. Random patterns can be due to inherent variability in the data or measurement errors.
> 5. Outliers: Outliers are observations that significantly deviate from the expected pattern in the data. They can be caused by measurement errors, unusual events, or extreme values.
> 6. Correlation: Correlation refers to the relationship between two variables. Positive correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase, while negative correlation indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.
> 7. Clustering: Clustering refers to the presence of groups or clusters of similar observations in the data. This pattern suggests that certain subsets of the data share common characteristics or behaviors.
> 8. Regression: Regression patterns refer to relationships between one dependent variable and one or more
