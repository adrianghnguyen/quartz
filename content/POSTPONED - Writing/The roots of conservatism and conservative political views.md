Conservatism is a political and social philosophy that emphasizes the preservation of traditional institutions, values, and established societal norms. It advocates for a cautious approach to change, valuing the stability and continuity of existing systems. Conservatism typically seeks to maintain order, respect for authority, and a strong sense of community. It is often associated with a preference for limited government intervention in economic and social matters.

In other words, they seek to preserve the status quo.

The origins of conservative political beliefs can be traced back to different historical and philosophical sources:

1. **Edmund Burke and Traditionalism:** One of the foundational figures of conservatism is Edmund Burke (1729â€“1797), an Irish-British statesman and philosopher. In his work "Reflections on the Revolution in France" (1790), Burke criticized the radical changes brought about by the French Revolution and stressed the importance of preserving established institutions that had evolved over time. He argued that society should evolve organically and that abrupt changes could lead to chaos.
2. **Classical Liberalism:** Early conservatism emerged in response to the Enlightenment and the rise of classical liberalism. While classical liberals advocated for individual freedoms, limited government, and free markets, conservatives were concerned about the potential disruptions to social order and traditional values caused by rapid change. They believed that a degree of continuity and stability was necessary for societal well-being.
3. **Reaction to Revolutions:** The French Revolution (1789) and subsequent revolutions in Europe led to a conservative backlash against what were perceived as radical and disruptive forces. Conservatives sought to preserve the traditional monarchical, religious, and social hierarchies that were threatened by these revolutionary movements.
4. **Religious and Cultural Values:** Religious and cultural beliefs have also influenced conservative thought. Many conservatives emphasize the role of religion and moral values in maintaining a stable society. They view institutions like the family as essential to social cohesion and emphasize their preservation.
5. **Anti-Socialist Sentiment:** In response to the rise of socialist and communist ideologies, conservatism took a stance against centralized control of the economy and the erosion of private property rights. Conservatives championed the importance of private enterprise and market competition.
6. **Nationalism and Identity:** Conservatism often aligns with nationalism and the preservation of national identity, culture, and traditions. This can lead to a preference for policies that protect national interests and border security.

It's important to note that conservatism is not a monolithic ideology, and different strands of conservatism exist, including fiscal conservatism, social conservatism, and neoconservatism, each with its own emphases and priorities. Over time, conservatism has adapted to changing social and political contexts, but its core principles of preserving tradition, stability, and community cohesion remain central to its philosophy.

## Conservative beliefs are motivated by uncertainty and fear

> Jost et al.'s (2003) meta-analysis^[Jost, J. T., Stern, C., Rule, N. O., & Sterling, J. (2017). The politics of fear: Is there an ideological asymmetry in existential motivation?. Social cognition, 35(4), 324-353.] confirms that several psychological variables predict political conservatism. The list includes death anxiety; system instability; dogmatism; intolerance of ambiguity, low openness to experience, and uncertainty; need for order, closure, and negative integrative complexity; and fear of threat and loss of self-esteem.

## Political conservatism may be driven by societal circumstances

> Treating political conservatism as a specific form of motivated social thinking means that we focus on the situational factors that influence conservative beliefs and actions. This is because [[Our environment shapes our behaviour|our attitudes, beliefs, goals, and motives are influenced by the situation we are in and how relevant they are to that situation]]. Previous research has shown that threats in a situation can lead to conservative political outcomes, but there is still much more to explore. By understanding the cognitive and motivational aspects of conservatism, future research can investigate a wider range of social situations and conditions that give rise to conservative attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, and even social movements.^[Jost, J.

It examines the ideas of key thinkers like Edmund Burke, Joseph de Maistre, and Thomas Hobbes, who defended monarchy and hierarchy during periods of upheaval, while also exploring the shift in economic theories through the "Marginal Revolution" and its impact on the development of modern conservatism. The video underscores the consistent thread of conservatism's resistance to sharing power and its skepticism toward democracy, offering a comprehensive perspective on the tradition's core principles and its relationship with historical and contemporary viewpoints.

This highlights the view that conservatism is about conserving power structures and is driven by fear as well as the maintenance of social hierarchies.
