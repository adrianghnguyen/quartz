[Martha Graham on the Hidden Danger of Comparing Yourself to Others](https://jamesclear.com/quality-comparison)

The world is tough and cruel. Let the others judge your work instead of [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|being your biggest critic]]. [[Social comparison|We should not compare ourselves to others.]] Instead, [[Show up and at least try your best|we should show up]] and do our best work possible. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, through [[Incremental change|incremental change]] something beautiful will be built.

I think it's easy to think of all the multiple reasons as to [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|why we will fail]] and come up with no reasons to even begin [[Make quick and decisive actions|taking action]]. I have the [[Inclination are personal preferences|personal tendency]] to stop short and not start because of the desire for [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]]. Perhaps it is borne out of a certain feeling that the world is 'fair' and 'rewards' us based on our sense of worth as a person. But that is indeed not how it works. The world simply gives to us, with no sense and order. As a result, I think it's important to believe in my [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal agency]] and the ability to influence my future for the better - [[Learned optimism is a skill|I need to believe that things will be brighter]] if I persist.

## Have a 'So what?' attitude when feelings of doubt come in

I learned the value of thinking, so what, when I have questions of self, jobs prevent a self-doubt to see the value of my work. Does it really matter at the end of the day if my work is inferior to others - what matters is that I am [[Non-zero day mindset|better than yesterday]]. Internally, I feel [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|quite insecure]].

Here's what I can [[The stories we tell ourselves shape our approach towards life|tell myself]] instead to build up my [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive self-talk]]:

- Did I learn something new from this new experience?
	- [[Learning new things is often difficult|Learning new information is often difficult]]
	- [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures provide learning opportunities]]
- Does it truly matter if I [[Social comparison|don't compare up to the standard of others]]?

It's a good way to build [[Self-compassion is about being kind to yourself|self-compassion]] towards [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|perceived failures]] when I don't feel like I am not as smart, and successful as others. Act with the [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|as if principle]] to emulate someone with [[True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves|high self-esteem]].

## Keeping your own eyes on your own paper - as said by James Clear

> [!Quote] Keep your eyes on your own paper
> _It doesn’t make a difference what the person next to you writes down for his answer. This is your race to run. It’s your assignment to complete. It’s your answer to create. How your paper compares to someone else’s is not the point. The point is to fill the paper with your work._

So I should go out there and fail. [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|Learning is dependent on being wrong]]. [[Rapid experimentation|Fail often. Learn from it.]]  Adjust accordingly. Better than to not have tried at all. It's important to not left self-judgment get in the way of going out and doing things - especially to [[Social comparison|compare myself with others]]. The work is to [[Show up and at least try your best|Simply show up and try my best]].

Forget about [[The garden of shame metaphor|other people's expectations]] and just focus on my [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|personal career journey]] and [[Understanding the complexity of life|voyage in life]].

> If what you write on your paper doesn’t meet someone else’s expectations … it is no concern of yours. The way someone else perceives what you do is a result of their own experiences (which you can’t control), their own tastes and preferences (which you can’t predict), and their own expectations (which you don’t set). If your choices don’t match their expectations that is their concern, not yours.
