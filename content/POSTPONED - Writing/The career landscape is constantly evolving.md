We should take most career advice with a grain of salt because our world is changing faster than ever, leading to [[Half-life of knowledge and its decay|knowledge decay]]. The good news is that we can have a certain competitive advantage if we can become a [[Seeing the world as it is is being realistic|hyperrealist]] about the current working landscape instead of using outdated [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]].

Another way of putting it, the meta is always changing and I should seek to update beliefs consistently in order to [[Developing wisdom is about being realistic|develop wisdom]].

> A [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]] is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today’s available game boards—and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career’s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it’s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.
