## Definition of substitution effect

> [!ai]+ AI
> **Substitution Effect** refers to the change in consumption patterns of a consumer in response to a change in the relative prices of goods. Specifically, it is the tendency of consumers to replace the relatively expensive goods with cheaper alternatives, given that their purchasing power remains constant. For instance, if the price of coffee increases while the price of tea remains the same, consumers may switch from consuming coffee to tea.
>
> The substitution effect can create an apparent paradox known as the Giffen Paradox, where the price of a good increases, and the quantity demanded also increases. This effect can occur when a good is used for survival, and its increase in price forces consumers to purchase less of other goods, which are not essential for consumption.
