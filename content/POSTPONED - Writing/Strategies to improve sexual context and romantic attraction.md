| Stuff That Raises Your Heart Rate | Early in a relationship, engage in heart-pumping activities that get your heart racing, such as going on roller coasters, taking long, fast hikes, watching scary movies, attending large concerts or political rallies, or discussing exciting topics like science. This will create general arousal and signal to your brain that your partner is exciting.                                                                                                                   |
| Meaningful Challenges             | To reinforce commitment and deepen connection, engage in shared, meaningful challenges and novel experiences. Fulfill a lifelong sexual fantasy together, turn on the lights to connect visually, and dive into trust in a big way. Give yourselves a meaningful goal to work towards as a couple to "advance the plot" in a long-term relationship. This approach is based on research and can help revitalize a relationship that has reached the "happily ever after" phase. |

Strategies from [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]. These will not work if we have a lot of [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sexual brakes]] going on.

## Remove sexual turn-offs

Aka removing [[Sexual Inhibitory System or sexual brake|sexual brakes]]. You need to [[Identify with your goals|make it central to your identity]] that enjoying sex is an [[Identify with your goals|important goal to you]]. Have a plan, anticipate barriers and make it part of my identity.

Enjoying sex needs to be [[Identify with your goals|part of your identity]] and sexual shame is barrier to this as [[Sexual language is learned implicitly|sexual language is learned implicitly]].

One doesn't need to increase their desire for sex, but it can be changed when one desires it.

## Stopping chasing dynamics through desperate measures

This is one option when there's a chasing dynamic aka mismatch in [[Sexual desire is spontaneous or responsive and everything in between|desires for sex]]. May also happen due to a difference in [[Attachment styles are our patterns of behavior in relationships|attachment styles]].

Based on Gottman's research, avoidant-anxious couples may enter a '[[Pursuer distancer dynamic in relationships|dance of intimacy]]' where the pendulum swings back and forth between who chases.

1. Attempt no sex in order to reduce pressure/dread
2. Alternate who initiates. That way it relieves pressure and changes the chasing dynamic.
3. Change your attitude towards sex. Either reduce expectation and pressures towards sex - let go of your preconceptions and sexual [[Shame and guilt are inherited|shame]].
