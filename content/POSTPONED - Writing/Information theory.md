> Information theory is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the quantification, storage, and transmission of information. It was developed in the mid-20th century by Claude Shannon and is now widely used in computer science, telecommunications, and other fields. Information theory seeks to understand how information can be efficiently transmitted over noisy channels by encoding it into signals that can be reliably decoded by the receiver. It also provides a framework for measuring the amount of information in a message, which can be used to optimize communication systems and improve data compression techniques. The fundamental concepts of information theory include [[Entropy|entropy]], mutual information, channel capacity, and coding theory.
