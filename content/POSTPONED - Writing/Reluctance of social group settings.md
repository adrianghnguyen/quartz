## Personal reflections on group settings

Related to [[2023-06-21]]

I was talking about this with my friends %%[[Rachel Cao|Rachel]] and Ben%% yesterday when we were out for a walk, but I'm wondering why, even though I'm a social person, I have a reluctance of joining and signing up for general classes.

Perhaps because I feel uncomfortable in big social groups, and it's something I need to think about. Is it maybe because [[Personal reflections on my childhood|when I was young]] I would be forced to sign up for classes I didn't really want to [[My hobbies and favorite activities|enjoy]] so I have a bad experience with them? Or is it because I feel like I need to play a certain social role in groups rather than being myself? Maybe it's an answer found in [[the presentation of self]]

He brought up a good point, is that we don't need to force ourselves to be anything in big groups. So with the knowledge that I'm an adult now, I can create my own positive experience in classes. Create something [[View challenges as opportunities|uncomfortable]] and something new rather than learning things on my own. But that's how we grow as a person, right?
