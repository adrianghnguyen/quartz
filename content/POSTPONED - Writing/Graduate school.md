It's not easy to do. A lot of PhD programs can be demoralizing and people often struggle with mental health and it also costs a lot of money and they take a lot of time. So it's something that should be done with a lot of thought.

## Deciding if I should go to graduate school or not

When making a decision if I should pursue an advanced degree, I should consider what will help me [[Minimizing future regret to make choices|minimize future regret]].Based on [[The organization 80 000 hours|The organization 80 000 hours]] - I should consider who can help progress and contribute to [[Career capital|my career capital]] and place me on a better career path.

I've done some preliminary research on [[Schools Offering Post-graduate Programs in Cognitive Science|universities with cognitive science programs]].

This article [Deciding to wait for impact](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/#should-you-wait-to-have-an-impact) gives some of the thoughts I should consider if it's worth just pursuing a job or going for an advanced degree. It's worth thinking about.

> The article discusses the dilemma of whether to pursue a PhD or work as an AI safety engineer to have a higher impact. It highlights the trade-off of giving up early impact and delaying it further into the future by choosing the PhD route. There is a risk of losing focus on having an impact while pursuing a PhD, as evidenced by informal polls. The decision to pursue a PhD should be based on whether the career capital gained outweighs the potential impact as a software engineer in AI safety. However, there is a possibility of having significantly more impact as a researcher and gaining valuable career capital. It is crucial to find the right balance between impact and career capital, considering the quality of opportunities, urgency of global problems, and age. Additional recommended readings on the topic are provided for further exploration.

## Pros and cons of advanced studies

- Positives
	- Mentorship opportunities and career guidance/feedback
	- Networking opportuniies
	- Build expert-level skills + develop new ones
- Negatives

I think so far, I am leaning towards it being a path I should strongly consider as I am essentially considering a career change which is a big [[Accept life transitions as a natural part of life|life transition]]. I would be starting in new unknown territory and having a supportive environment which can provide guidance would be very useful. It would also add to a [[Model of success|model of success]] rather than striking it out on my own within the industry and trying to make my way in.

Why does part of me think of it as cowardice going back to school? It's something I need to think about. Because I feel like I'm failing to uphold a certain image I've painted in my self-esteem and [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|personal identity]]?

## Factors to consider in graduate program selection

> - Will you get good mentorship? Learning how to do good research is a craft that gets passed down mainly via hands-on training, so this is vital. Getting good mentorship helps hugely with motivation and your future opportunities in academia. It often comes down to the specific person you’ll be working with and your fit with them.
> - Will the particular university be an environment where you can flourish? For example, in terms of location and culture?
> - What’s the reputation of the professor and university? Your supervisor’s reputation in the field will impact your future opportunities in academia. Being at a well-known university is useful for opportunities outside of academia (e.g. as a communicator or in policy).
> - Will you get funding?
