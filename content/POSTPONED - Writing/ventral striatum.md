## Definition of ventral striatrium

> [!ai]+ AI
> ## Ventral Striatum
>
> The ventral striatum is a region in the basal ganglia of the brain that is involved in the processing of rewards and motivation. It is located deep within the cerebral hemispheres and primarily consists of the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the olfactory tubercle. The ventral striatum receives input from various brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus.
>
> Studies have shown that the ventral striatum plays a crucial role in the learning and reinforcement of rewarding behaviors, such as eating or engaging in social interactions. Dysregulation of the ventral striatum has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including addiction and depression.
