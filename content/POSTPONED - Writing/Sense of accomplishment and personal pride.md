> A sense of accomplishment results from mastering an endeavor and working towards goals. Achievements contribute to wellbeing because individuals can look at their lives with a sense of pride.

I sometimes have difficulty as a result of [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] to believe in myself - I fail to acknowledge my positives, personal strengths and [[My personal accomplishments and victories|my personal accomplishments]]. Sometimes, it's worth trusting a [[External friendly voices|friendly external voice]].

A healthy and balanced sense of [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]] is not about toxic humility but rather the ability have a realistic look at ourselves - to take pride in what we do and acknowledge where they may still work to be done. It's not necessary to [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|be overly critical]] of myself in order to achieve personal growth.

## Don't worry about others - recognize and validate your own efforts

It's important to [[Let the world decide the value of your work|let the world decide]] instead of worrying about what other people may think of me. I need to believe that [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|I am enough]] and that external perceptions drawing from sources of [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]] or external validation on the quality of my work. In that sense, I need to take personal pride in simply [[Being authentic is doing it regardless of outcome|doing it regardless of outcome]].

In my [[External friendly voices|external counsel]] - they believe that I do good work, that I am [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|competent]]. So trust in that rather than the [[Dealing with our inner critic|cruel inner voice]] which thinks that I am unable to do good. [[Self-confidence|I need to trust]] that I will have put my best efforts forward - it's okay if it doesn't land up to imagined quality standards. What is worth praising instead is the [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]] and the [[Show up and at least try your best|habit of showing up]].

## Reflections on accomplishment and being able to achieve our dreams

I believe that this sense of accomplishment would lead to a greater sense of [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]] which would enhance our sense of wellbeing. For example, this would apply to the belief that I can eventually achieve [[My career mission|my career mission]] and the belief that I am taking the right steps towards achieving it.

I'll need to work on it, bit by bit and [[Self-confidence|believe in my personal abilities]]. I'm thinking back on the [[2023-08-03|conversation I had the other day]] on whether I'll be able to achieve my dreams or not. The real answer is, I simply don't know. We should make small goals to [[Incremental goals help sustain grit|make small goals to motivate my dreams]].

Am I taking a step in the right direction? Did I remove things which may detract me from this mission - following [[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet|prioritizing like Warren Buffet]]. What is [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|truly important to me]]?

The only thing in which I believe I can take pride is the fact that I'll have tried my best, by building [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|good habits]] as well [[Non-zero day mindset|being grateful to my 3 selves]].
