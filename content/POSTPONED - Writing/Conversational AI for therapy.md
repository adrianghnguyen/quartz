# Conversational AI for therapy

Related to [[REF Augmenting Psychotherapy with AI]]

There is [[Artificial intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare technologies|potential usage for AI (artificial intelligence) in therapeutic settings]] to help augment limited number of human therapists through AI chatbots. I've been experimenting with [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|heyPI]] recently. In mental healthcare, [[conversational AI]] could be used to provide virtual therapy, counseling, and support. Such tools could be used to supplement clinician experience and insight.

Conversational AI has the potential to revolutionize mental health care by preventing excessive personalizing cost effective therapy support. There's a lot of innovation to be done in this space.

It could be used in a variety of ways:
- Virtual therapy
- Monitoring patients and interim solution between professional therapy sessions
- Provide further tailored education and resources for patients
- Symptom evaluation
- Perform e-triage

> [!NOTE]-
> Conversational AI can be used in a variety of ways to improve mental healthcare. Here are some examples:
> 1. Virtual Therapy: Conversational AI can be used to provide virtual therapy sessions. Patients can interact with an AI-powered therapist in real-time, just like they would with a human therapist. The AI therapist can ask questions, provide feedback, and offer coping strategies.
> 2. Monitoring and Support: Conversational AI can be used to monitor patients and offer support between therapy sessions. For example, an AI chatbot could check in with a patient daily to see how they're feeling and offer support if needed.
> 3. Education and Resources: Conversational AI can be used to provide education and resources on mental health topics. An AI chatbot could provide information on depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions, as well as tips for coping and self-care.

Underlying technologies powering such [[Artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] therapists would include natural language understanding (NLU), and intent recognition which are all part of [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing (NLP)]].

## Advantages of conversational AI in mental healthcare

> Conversational AI has several benefits for mental healthcare, including:
>
> 1. Accessibility: Conversational AI can be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection, making mental healthcare more accessible to underserved communities and those in remote areas.
> 2. Personalization: Conversational AI can provide personalized therapy and support based on the patient's needs and preferences.
> 3. Privacy: Conversational AI can provide a private and confidential space for patients to discuss their mental health concerns.
> 4. Cost-effective: Conversational AI can be more cost-effective than traditional therapy, making it a more affordable option for many people.

## Possible drawbacks of conversational AI in mental healthcare

> While conversational AI has many benefits, there are also some challenges to consider, including:
>
> 1. Limitations: Conversational AI is not yet advanced enough to replace human therapists in all cases. It may not be able to pick up on subtle cues or provide the same level of emotional support as a human therapist.
> 2. Ethical Concerns: Conversational AI raises ethical concerns around privacy and the potential for misdiagnosis or harm to patients.
> 3. User Experience: Conversational AI needs to be user-friendly and engaging in order to be effective. If patients find the technology difficult to use or impersonal, they may not be willing to use it for mental healthcare.

## Conversational AI in therapy could provide opportunities for a spectrum of care

The article [Key Considerations for Incorporating Conversational AI in Psychotherapy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.00746/full) below provides four alternatives to health care therapy:
- traditional therapy with no AI involvement,
- traditional therapy augmented with AI (akin to the approaches described above),
- therapy that is AI delivered but human supervised
- therapy that is 100 percent provided by AI with no expectation of supervision by a human clinician.

It seems like it would be a spectrum based on the level of AI assisted healthcare.

## Factors of success for chatbot therapist

Dimensions to consider when it comes to the ways a chatbot therapist would work.
- quality of care
- clinician-patient relationship
- patients' willingness to be intimate and reveal deeper thoughts
- data privacy/safety/oversight
- access to mental health
