## Overview of difference between axons and dendrites

> The **key difference** between axon and dendrites is the function of these two types of cytoplasmic extensions of the neuron. **Axon passes nerve impulses away from the cell body while dendrites pass nerve impulses towards the cell body**.

> Axons and dendrites are important structures found in a neuron. The neuron is the main structural and functional unit of the nervous system. The axons involve in taking nerve impulses away from the cell body. These signals are passed on to effector cells such as muscles and glands. Dendrites are involved in transmitting nerve impulses towards the cell body. The nerve signals received by sensory organs are passed on to the cell body. This is the difference between axons and dendrites.

| Feature                  | Axons                                         | Dendrites                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Function                 | The axon is the long extension of the neuron that passes nerve impulses away from the cell body. | The dendrites are the short extensions that pass nerve impulses towards the cell body. |
| Structure                | Axons are a long thin process of uniform thickness and smoothness. | Dendrites are short processes, thickness diminishes, and the branches are studded with spiny projections. |
| Number per Cell Body     | One neuron has one axon.                      | One neuron has multiple projections of dendrites. |
| Neurofibrils             | Neurofibrils are present in axons.            | Neurofibrils are absent in dendrites.        |
| Presence of Nissl’s Granules | Nissl’s granules are absent in axons.        | Nissl’s granules are present in axons.       |
| Ribosomes                | Ribosomes are absent in axons.                | Ribosomes are present in axons.              |
| Myelin Insulation        | Myelin sheath may be or may not be present in axons. | Myelin sheath is absent in dendrites.    |
| Branching Points         | Branching points of axons branch away from the cell body. | Branching points of dendrites branch closer to the cell body. |

Quite fascinating there are multiple input sources to receive signals, having multiple dendrites (inbound signals) while having less axons (one bottleneck for *sending* signals).
