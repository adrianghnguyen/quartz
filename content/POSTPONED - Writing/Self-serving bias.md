## What is self-serving bias?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Self-serving bias is a cognitive bias in which individuals tend to attribute their successes to internal factors (such as their own abilities or efforts) while attributing their failures to [[Personality is shaped our environment|external factors]] (such as bad luck or the actions of others). This bias can lead people to overestimate their own skills and contributions, while underestimating the importance of outside factors and the contributions of others. Self-serving bias can also lead to a lack of accountability and an unwillingness to take responsibility for one's own actions and decisions.
