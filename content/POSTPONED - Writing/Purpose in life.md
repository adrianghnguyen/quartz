## A personal ambition provides direction in life

[[Pursue true happiness as a priority in daily life|Our highest purpose and priority in life is to pursue happiness.]]  According to the [[PERMA Profiler measures personal flourishing across many domains|PERMA model]], being engaged with life, having meaning and having a sense of accomplishment in regards to working towards [[Make progress towards long-term goals|long-term goals]] is what leads us to [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|optimal psychological well-being and functioning]]. This is supported by research which shows that [[Research demonstrates that happiness can lead to success|being happy leads to success]]. As a result, a [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|meaningful career]] is an important [[Happiness as an investment portfolio with a mix of factors|factor for happiness]].

Due to the way society is structured, a lot of our waking hours are spent around work so we should seek environments which bring out our best selves and our [[Signature strengths|signature strengths]]. Perhaps not all the boxes will be ticked off, but that's when we should [[Make the future you want with personal agency|take things into our own hands]] and engage in [[Job crafting|job crafting]] to help it better align with our [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|personal values]].

Having a personal ambition, or feeling like we have a purpose in life to give us meaning can help us overcome [[Dealing with weakness|moments of difficulties]] such as [[Crisis of meaning is a feeling of psychological and existential unrest|existential crises]]. With a [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|purpose and direction in life]] which we have set, we can fight off [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|overwhelming feelings of pessimism leading to loss of hope]].

## Setting a personal ambition is a deliberate process of introspection

Having personal ambition differs from [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|chasing external rewards]]. It's about creating [[Create meaningful goals which are authentic to you|personally meaningful goals]] where our work is to the service of others as echoed by the [[Happiness is achieved by recognizing shared humanity and love for others|advice of the Dalai Lama.]] It means having a [[Pursue a greater goal in life using a career mission|mission-driven mindset for career development]]. It's not easy to do, requiring a lot of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|careful self-examination]].

It's not exactly easy to find out what we wish to do. It's not as simple as [[Why you shouldn't follow your passion for a successful career|following your passion]]. It requires carefully untangling of hidden motivations, and planted thoughts to find out what really resembles me.

It also means that I need to keep an [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|flexible and open-minded]] when it comes to future potential opportunities. [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|Designing a fulfilling life requires an iterative approach]] and it means that my career journey will most likely not be linear since I am following a [[Career trajectories have different unique paths|non-traditional path]]. It's okay to recognize that it'll have ups and downs - [[Success requires time and patience|success is not a linear upwards journey]].

It'll require reconciliation between what I seek and desire in [[My ideal life|my ideal life]] and what is actually possible, dependent on my individual competencies. My starting point from someone who may have started off with more resources, or just individual circumstances means that it may take longer to get to where I am hoping. That's okay. Deep breath.

The important thing once I've determined what's important in [[My career mission|my career mission]] is to [[Show up and at least try your best|keep showing up]]. It's tough, and a lot of fears wil stand in the way. There are times where I will [[Dealing with weakness|feel weak]]. I can use this to help re-center myself.
