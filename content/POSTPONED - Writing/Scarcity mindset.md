> Scarcity mindset refers to a psychological belief that there is not enough of something to go around, leading to feelings of lack and limitation. It is characterized by a constant fear of scarcity and a focus on what one lacks rather than what they have. This mindset can affect various aspects of life, including relationships, finances, and personal well-being. Overcoming scarcity mindset involves shifting one's perspective towards abundance and adopting a mindset of abundance and gratitude.
