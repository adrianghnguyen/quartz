Related to [[Module 3 Love and Relationships, Part 1]]

According to the Grant study, George Vaillant was able to identify 7 habits become happy and well towards our old age. This was codified through the Seven Habits Scale.

> The Grant study found that there are seven habits that result in individuals being happy and well in older age rather than ending up sad and sick. George Vaillant called these two outcomes **“Happy-Well”** vs. **“Sad-Sick.”** The seven practices that the Grant Study showed lead to happiness and good health are:
>
> 1. Do not smoke.
> 2. Do not abuse alcohol.
> 3. Maintain a healthy body weight.
> 4. Maintain daily exercise.
> 5. Develop an [[Notes Central Hub/General notes/Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive coping style]] (this means that you have good conflict-resolution practices).
> 6. Foster a [[Growth mindset|growth mindset]] (invest in education or the practices of lifelong learning).
> 7. Maintain stable, long-term friendships and loving relationships.
>
> Next, you'll reflect on your habits. Rank yourself on a scale of 1–10 on each of the Harvard Study habits that Dr. Waldinger mentioned earlier in the course. Rank yourself according to what you think your score was for this year, and what would like your score to be next year.
