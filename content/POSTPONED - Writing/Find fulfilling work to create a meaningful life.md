## How to discover fulfilling work

- Identify your core values: What's most important to you in a job? Is it flexibility, creativity, or a sense of purpose?
- Assess your skills and strengths: What are you really good at? Think about your work experience, education, and personal passions.
- Research potential jobs: Look into jobs that align with your values and strengths, and that match your lifestyle. Check out job descriptions, salary ranges, and company cultures.
- Network and explore: Reach out to people in industries or roles you're interested in. Ask them about their experiences and get a sense of what the work is like.
- Try things out: Consider internships, freelance work, or other opportunities to test the waters and see what you like.
