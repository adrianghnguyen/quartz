# Keep life simple by sticking to the essentials

#status/postponed

However, we need to be careful because [[Playing it safe prevents personal growth|playing it safe can prevent us from achieving personal growth]] and [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|flourishing as a person]] if we don't learn to take personal risks and go outside our zones of comfort.

We should focus on the essential aspects of our lives which matter the most to us.

## Priorize what is important

> "All I honestly have to do is, shit, eat, sleep".

When I feel [[Too many feelings lead to emotional overload|feel overwhelmed]] with emotions, I can sometimes scatter and start [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|overthinking]]. This can prevent me from functioning and lead me to rabbit hole into [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]].

I need to stick to the fundamentals and think of what are the truly important things I need to take care of. There's always room to negotiate, delay or push back if I am willing to accept the repercussions. Most things in life are not that important or critical - it's more so the pressure I give myself to accomplish them. Feeling like I have too many expectations and then feeling like I cannot rise up to the bar leads to [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]].

Instead, I should focus on the philosophy of [[The value of good enough|good enough]].

Here's prescribed solution if I ever feel down and overwhelmed:
1. Write down what I need to accomplish
2. Determine if it's truly important. 
3. If not, make a choice to intentionally delay the task or discard it entirely. Obligations are something which are self-imposed. 
4. What's an [[Make quick and decisive actions|immediate action]] (ideally >10 mins to accomplish) which I can to to help complete the task to help as commitment follows action. [[Myth of motivation|Motivation is a myth]]. Just get started.

> Essentialism is a philosophical and practical approach that emphasizes the importance of focusing on the essential aspects of life. It advocates for simplifying one's life by eliminating non-essential activities, possessions, and commitments in order to create more space and time for what truly matters.

> At its core, essentialism encourages individuals to identify their priorities and eliminate anything that does not align with those priorities. This involves acknowledging that we have limited time, energy, and resources, and therefore, we should be intentional about how we allocate them. By consciously choosing what is truly important to us and letting go of everything else, essentialism enables us to lead more meaningful and fulfilling lives.

## Manage your social commitments

- [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance]]

I think I sometimes have the tendency to over-commit myself to too many social activities. It can be very enjoyable and spending time with the people that we love is really great. However, it comes at the expense that I need to recognize my physical limits and that there are things I would also like to do for myself. I think I should be intentional in terms of what I want to do well. It can also be important to set up rituals to determine what is truly important, what I want to progress on. Sometimes there's a decision to be made between choosing to spend time with other people and what we want to personally do. It's something I'll need to reflect upon. I just feel a bit tired these days from going out so much I think. It seems like I almost have something going on every single day and I think that's a bit much. I also need a bit of time to decompress and practice some self-care.
