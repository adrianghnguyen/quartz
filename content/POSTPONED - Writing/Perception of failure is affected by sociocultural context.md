There's nothing wrong in failing and it may have perverted our meaning of success  - and its more so with the rise of American culture that this has changed.^[ [HISTORY OF IDEAS - Failure - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IUj6jyoTl0&t=27s&pp=ygUSaGlzdG9yeSBvZiBmYWlsdXJl)]

Throughout history, different cultures and time periods have had varying views on failure. Some cultures emphasized the nobility of failing with dignity, while others associated failure with shame and even self-destruction. In Christianity and Buddhism, humility and renunciation were valued, challenging the materialistic notions of success.
