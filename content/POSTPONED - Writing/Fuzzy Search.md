## What is fuzzy searching?

It's an algorithm which allows us to find text despite ambiguity. We can use fuzzy searching algorithms in order to do approximate string matching to find something close to our search query even if it isn't an exact match. This is typically used when we're searching a corpus (body) of text or a database. Humans are prone to data entry errors so we need a level of fault tolerance in our search queries. It needs to handle ambiguity.

## How a fuzzy search algorithm work

> The implementation of a fuzzy searching algorithm depends on the specific similarity measure and algorithm used. However, most fuzzy searching algorithms follow a similar approach:
>
> 1.  Preprocessing: The algorithm first processes the search term and the database entries to convert them into a standard format, such as lowercase or removing stop words, to make the comparison process more efficient.
> 2.  Tokenization: The algorithm splits the search term and database entries into tokens or terms, which are individual words or phrases that can be compared.
> 3.  Scoring: The algorithm calculates a score for each token in the search term and each token in the database entries. The score is usually based on a similarity measure that takes into account the differences between the tokens, such as the Levenshtein distance, the Jaro-Winkler distance, or the cosine similarity.
> 4.  Matching: The algorithm compares the scores of the search term tokens to the tokens in the database entries to determine the overall similarity between the search term and each entry.
> 5.  Ranking: The algorithm sorts the database entries by their similarity score to the search term, with the most similar entries ranked higher.
> 6.  Thresholding: The algorithm may also apply a threshold to filter out entries that are not similar enough to the search term.
> 7.  Display: Finally, the algorithm displays the top-ranked database entries as the search results, along with their similarity scores.

Some algorithms may use advanced techniques like indexing, caching, or machine learning to improve performance or accuracy. Overall, fuzzy searching algorithms can be highly effective in finding relevant information in large databases or text corpora with flexible search queries.
