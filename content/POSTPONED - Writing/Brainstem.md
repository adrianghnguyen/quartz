> The brainstem is the structure that connects the cerebrum of the brain to the spinal cord and cerebellum. It is composed of three sections in descending order: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. It is responsible for many vital functions of life, such as breathing, consciousness, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep. The brainstem contains many critical collections of white and grey matter.^[Basinger H, Hogg JP. Neuroanatomy, Brainstem. [Updated 2022 Jul 6]. In: StatPearls [Internet].
