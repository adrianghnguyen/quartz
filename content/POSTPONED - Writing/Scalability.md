## Scaling laws

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Scaling laws are mathematical relationships that describe how certain properties or characteristics of a system change as the system's size or scale changes. These laws help us understand how different variables are related to each other and how they change in relation to the size of the system. Scaling laws are commonly used in fields such as physics, biology, and engineering to predict and analyze phenomena across different scales. They provide valuable insights into the behavior and properties of complex systems.
