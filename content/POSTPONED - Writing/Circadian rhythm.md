> Circadian rhythm refers to the biological process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle in living organisms. It is an internal 24-hour clock that controls various physiological and behavioral patterns, including hormone production, body temperature, and sleep patterns. This rhythm is primarily influenced by external cues, such as light and darkness, which help synchronize the internal clock with the external environment. Disruptions to the circadian rhythm, such as shift work or jet lag, can lead to sleep disorders and other health issues.
