> Economist Ofer Malamud ran a study in which he analyzed and recorded the experiences of two groups of college graduates: those who specialized in their chosen fields of study after graduation and those who chose an entirely different field. He found that although those who specialized tended to earn more in the short term, those who chose different fields quickly caught up and experienced higher match quality—meaning their work better matched their true interests. Malamud concluded that “The benefits to increased match quality…outweigh the greater loss in skills. [In other words,] Learning stuff was less important than learning about oneself” (Range, 130)

According to the economist Ofer Malamud who studied people who specialized vs those who chose different fields, there were some interesting insights about careers:
- Specialization leads to higher income in the short-term but generalists tend to catch up on the longer term as they match something which is more aligned to their personal or true interests (leading to harmonious passion?)
- One of the conclusions is that it's more important to [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|learn about oneself]] rather than learning things
- Few of us end up doing what we planned or envisioned - as a result it is important to explore
