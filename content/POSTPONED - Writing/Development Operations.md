## Overview of development operations

> [!ai] AI
>
> DevOps is a set of practices that promotes collaboration and communication between software development and IT operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to improve the speed and quality of software delivery, while ensuring that the software is reliable and can be easily maintained.
>
> DevOps involves automating processes wherever possible, such as testing, deployment, and monitoring. It also involves using tools and technologies that facilitate collaboration and communication between teams, such as version control systems, continuous integration/delivery tools, and chat platforms.
>
> The DevOps philosophy is based on the belief that software development should be an ongoing process rather than a series of discrete steps. This means that developers should work closely with operations teams throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment and beyond.
>
> By adopting DevOps practices, organizations can improve their ability to deliver high-quality software quickly and efficiently. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction, faster time-to-market for new features and products, and improved overall business performance.
