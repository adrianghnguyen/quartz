Political neuroscience uses neuroscience to understand mechanisms of political beliefs. It's very tightly intertwined with political psychology.

> Political neuroscience is a field that combines neuroscience and political science to understand how the brain processes and influences political behavior and decision-making. It explores how neural mechanisms shape political attitudes, beliefs, and preferences. By studying brain activity through techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG), researchers can identify patterns related to political ideology, voting behavior, and responses to political messages. The goal of political neuroscience is to shed light on the biological basis of politics and provide insights into human behavior in the political sphere.

> A new study led by researchers at Brown University offers a neurological explanation for political polarization. The study shows that individuals who share a political ideology have more similar neural patterns when processing political words, experience greater neural synchrony when engaging with political content, and segment new information into the same units of meaning. The researchers used a combination of experiments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to analyze the brain activity of participants who identified as liberals or conservatives. They found that the neural fingerprints created by liberal brains were more similar to each other than to conservative brains, and vice versa. The study suggests that political polarization arises at the point when the brain receives and processes new information, and that semantic representations of political concepts shape political ideology. Understanding these mechanisms could inform interventions to combat polarization.
