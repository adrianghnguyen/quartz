SMART goals is an [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|effective framework]] for achieving specific outcomes such as objectives or goals. It stands for:
1. Specific
2. Measurable
3. Achievable
4. Relevant
5. Time-bound

By using this mental model, I can get into the habit of creating bite-sized goals to help me [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|stay committed and motivated]] towards what's truly important to me. It brings me one step closer to creating [[My ideal life|my ideal life]] and making progress towards my [[Make progress towards long-term goals|long-term objectives]].

It's a system of accountability because it brings us tangibility to our objectives and into a state of binary truth. "Yes I did this. No I did not do this. This is what I need to do next". I should keep this in mind if I want to keep up with the mindset of [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|doing the thing]].

As for myself, and most likely for other people, it's easy for us to daydream about things which we wish to achieve one day such as our [[Purpose in life|personal ambitions]]. Sometimes, these fantasies may become too big and nebulous. As a result, we may feel like we are not making progress towards the objective or living up to an [[unrealistic expectations|imagined standard]] in our minds which is a way of living in perpetual disappointment and feelings of failure.

Keep it actionable and it'll help us make sure we're making progress.
