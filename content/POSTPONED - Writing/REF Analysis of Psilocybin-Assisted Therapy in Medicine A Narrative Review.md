## Psilocybin usage in depression treatment

> An experiment conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center tested the efficacy of psilocybin in treating major depressive disorder. The team used a randomized, waiting list controlled trial to assess their patients’ results. Twenty-four patients were included in the study; 13 patients were in the immediate treatment group, receiving 20 mg/70 kg of psilocybin during session one and 30 mg/70 kg during session two, at week 3 and 4, respectively, and 11 patients were in the delayed group, receiving the same dosage as the immediate groups, at weeks 11 and 12, respectively. The delayed group allowed for the comparison between two otherwise similar groups, one having undergone the psilocybin therapy sessions and one not having completed it yet^[Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: a randomized double-blind trial.

### Treatment posology of psilocybin

Comprised of two sessions:
1. 20mg
2. 30mg

> Two psilocybin sessions (session 1: 20 mg/70 kg; session 2: 30 mg/70 kg) were given (administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water) in the context of supportive psychotherapy (approximately 11 hours). Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8-week delay.
