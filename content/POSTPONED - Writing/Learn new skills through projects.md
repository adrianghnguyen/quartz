# Learn new skills through projects

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Project-based learning is an educational approach that focuses on teaching students new skills and knowledge through the completion of projects. Rather than relying solely on traditional classroom instruction, project-based learning encourages hands-on, experiential learning.
>
> In project-based learning, students are given the opportunity to work on real-world problems or challenges that are relevant to their interests and goals. They are typically required to research, plan, and execute their projects, often in collaboration with their peers. This approach allows students to develop a wide range of skills, including problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, teamwork, and creativity.
>
> One of the key benefits of project-based learning is that it fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. By actively engaging in a project, students are able to connect theoretical concepts to practical applications. This helps them to see the relevance and importance of what they are learning.
>
> Additionally, project-based learning promotes student autonomy and ownership of their education. Instead of passively receiving information from teachers, students take responsibility for their own learning by actively guiding and directing their projects. This not only increases motivation and engagement but also helps them develop important skills such as time management and self-direction.
>
> Project-based learning also encourages collaboration and teamwork. Students often work in groups to complete projects,

## The philosophy of [[Accelerated learning is understanding how to learn faster and remember more|learning quickly]]

- Leverage other's hard work - stand on the shoulders of giants
	- Others have figured out best practices
	- Use heuristics
	- What are the pitfalls?
		- Don't plagiarize
		- Understand your limitations and biases ([[OODA Loop]])
	- Incorporate your own knowledge to develop comparative advantage
- projects force you to have an objective ([[Purpose in life]])
- How to plan a project to be effective
- [[Using deep work to learn new skills]]
- Trying to learn something new can be terrifying as we don't know where to start. We can begin [[Decompose difficult problems into smaller parts|solving difficult problems]] by establishing our building blocks and learn by components.

> Sharing knowledge and tools like that is very powerful and makes a big difference. As I use and reuse other people's work and knowledge many times a day. It never hurts to add to the mix.^[@nikitavoloboev from https://wiki.nikiv.dev/]
