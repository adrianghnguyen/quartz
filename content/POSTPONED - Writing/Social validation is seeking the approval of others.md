> Social validation refers to the process of seeking approval or confirmation from others in order to validate one's beliefs, actions, or choices. It is a psychological phenomenon where individuals rely on the opinions and feedback of others to determine the correctness or acceptability of their own behavior. This can be seen in various aspects of life, such as seeking social media likes and comments, conforming to societal norms, or relying on peer approval. Social validation can have both positive and negative effects on individuals, influencing their self-esteem, decision-making, and sense of belonging.

It is a type of social reward. It's important to acknowledge the pros and cons of this concept - social validation in itself is neither good nor bad. However, seeking [[external validation]] to the extent that we lose sense of our true selves, well perhaps that's [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|worth thinking about]].
