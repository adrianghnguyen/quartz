# True self-esteem is no longer having the need to prove ourselves

---

> True confidence is about a deep sense of acceptance and belief in one-self

I had a chat a while back with my massage therapist, [[Maellig Le Mezec|Maellig Le Mezec]], and she helped communicate that true self-esteem can be derived by no longer having a need to prove ourselves.

Oftentimes we need to prove ourselves by clinging on how we hope others to perceive us, maybe because of [[Societal pressures are imposed influence and expectation by society on individuals to conform|societal pressures]]. We can learn to let ourselves be free of this type of [[Human suffering stems from personal attachment|mental attachment]] through [[Love your authentic self by believing you are enough|authenticity and accepting our identity]].

## True confidence is a deep sense of personal acknowledgement and acceptance

True confidence is a deep and genuine belief in one's own abilities, qualities, and judgment. It is not about boasting or trying to impress others, but rather an inner understanding and acceptance of oneself.

It includes acknowledging your weaknesses and imperfections, but not letting them define you. There is a healthy balance to be made in terms of [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|personal responsibility]] without going into [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|excessive self-criticism]].

True confidence enables you to [[Take calculated risks like an entrepreneur|take risks]], face challenges with [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|personal resilience]], make mistakes and learn from them without [[Fear of failure|fear of failure]] or [[Let the world decide the value of your work|judgment]]. It also means respecting others and not [[Social comparison|comparing yourself with anyone else]].

### True confidence leads to resilience against setbacks

> I would argue that fragile self-confidence or letting results or circumstances dictate how confident you feel in the present moment IS NOT true confidence. Real self-confidence is stable, long-term, and lasting, even under adversity or poor results.

> True self-confidence is based on years and months of practice and competition. Is it fair to yourself as an athlete to throw away years of confidence-building **when you mess up one play, race, or shot?** I don’t think so.

 I was reading the following article [Believe in Yourself (And Why Nothing Will Work If You Don't...)](https://jamesclear.com/nothing-will-work-if-you-dont-believe-in-it) and James Clear, author of [[Atomic Habits by James Clear|Atomic Habits]], was responding to one of his readers. They were applying to one of his articles. And there's an undercurrent of [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|self-doubt and vulnerability]].

According to him, he notices the following thought pattern and proposes an alternative perspective to the problem:
> I don't believe these things will work for me. I don't believe in myself.

> Why are you determined to make these ideas _not_ work for you?
> Why are you searching for reasons why these ideas won't succeed instead of figuring out a way to *[[The difference between scarcity vs abundance mindset|make something good happen]]*?

Successful people are determined to make the situation work for them [[Personal responsibility is having accountability|by taking personal responsibility]], rather than playing the role of a victim and searching for reasons why a situation won't work.

I should be careful to practice awareness when I am in a [[Affect is how we experience emotions positively or negatively|downtrodden or in a pessimistic mood]]. We should have the foundational belief that we can become a better person with a [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|growth mindset]] - which includes believing in a [[Optimism is needed for long-term success|hopeful future]] of further opportunities. Its opposite would be adopting a position of [[Learned helplessness is giving up after repeated failures|learned helplessness]].

## People with high self-esteem have a balanced view of themselves and their capabilities leading to true confidence.

It involves [[Emotion coaching is accepting all feelings and working through them|acceptance of our own emotions and believing that they are valid]].

That’s why, unlike selfish people, they know how to listen and they aren’t constantly trying to be the center of attention. **Someone with good self-esteem has [empathy](https://exploringyourmind.com/theory-mind-root-empathy/) and more rewarding relationships.**^[[Self-Esteem and Ego: 7 Differences - Exploring your mind](https://exploringyourmind.com/self-esteem-and-ego-7-differences/)]
