# Active vs passive voice in writing

#status/postponed

In English grammar, sentences can be structured in two ways: active voice or passive voice. The difference between the two lies in the way the subject and the action (or verb) of the sentence are related to each other.

**Active Voice:**

In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. It's direct, clear, and concise. This makes the sentence more engaging and easier to understand. Here's the general structure:

`Subject + Verb + Object`

Examples of sentences in the active voice:

1.  John wrote the book. (John is the subject, wrote is the verb, the book is the object)
2.  I baked a cake. (I is the subject, baked is the verb, a cake is the object)
3.  The dog chased the cat. (The dog is the subject, chased is the verb, the cat is the object)

**Passive Voice:**

In passive voice, the subject of the sentence is acted upon by the verb. It is less direct and is often seen as more formal or academic. It can also sound a bit awkward in casual writing, and can be harder to understand. Here's the general structure:

`Subject + Be Verb + Past Participle + (by + Agent)`

Examples of sentences in the passive voice:

1.  The book was written by John. (The book is the subject, was written is the verb, John is the agent)
2.  A cake was baked by me. (A cake is the subject, was baked is the verb, me is the agent)
3.  The cat was chased by the dog. (The cat is the subject, was chased is the verb, the dog is the agent)

When you're writing, particularly in a conversational or narrative style, using active voice is usually the better choice. It keeps your writing direct, lively, and clear, and it makes your sentences less complicated and easier to understand.

Here's an example of how you might convert a sentence from passive to active voice:

Passive: The ball was thrown by the boy. Active: The boy threw the ball.

The active sentence is more direct and engagingâ€”it puts the reader right there with the boy as he's throwing the ball. The passive sentence, on the other hand, feels a bit more distant and formal.

In general, the active voice is more straightforward and concise, which is why it's often recommended for most types of writing. However, the passive voice is not incorrect and there are situations where it's preferable or even necessary, such as in scientific writing or when you want to emphasize the action rather than who is performing the action. But for most writing, especially creative or conversational, the active voice is the way to go.
