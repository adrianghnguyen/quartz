## What is the value of a statistical life?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> The value of a statistical life (VSL) is a monetary estimate of the value that society places on preventing a human death. It is calculated by analyzing people's willingness to pay for reducing the risk of death or increasing their life expectancy. The VSL is commonly used in cost-benefit analysis to determine the economic feasibility of public policy decisions that affect human health and safety, such as environmental regulations, workplace safety standards, and healthcare interventions. The VSL varies depending on factors such as age, income, occupation, and the level of risk involved.
>
> In the United States, the current estimate for the VSL ranges from **$10 million to $15 million** per life saved.
