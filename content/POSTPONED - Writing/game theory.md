## What is game theory?

> [!ai] AI
> Game Theory: Understanding Strategic Decision Making and Interactions between Players
>
> Game theory is a branch of mathematics that studies strategic decision making and interactions between players in different situations. It aims to analyze how rational individuals or organizations behave in competitive or cooperative settings where their outcomes depend on the choices made by others.
>
> Game theory provides a framework for analyzing various scenarios like economic competition, political negotiations, social interactions, and military conflicts. It uses mathematical models to represent the strategies available to each player and predicts the possible outcomes based on their actions.
>
> - One of the most famous examples of game theory is the Prisoner's Dilemma game where two individuals are given the choice to cooperate or defect with each other. The outcome depends on what both players choose, and it highlights how self-interest can sometimes lead to suboptimal results for all involved.
> - Another popular application of game theory is in auctions, where bidders compete against each other for a particular item. By understanding the strategies of other bidders, a participant can determine their optimal bid and maximize their chances of winning.
> - Game theory has many real-world applications, from designing optimal pricing strategies for companies to developing effective policies for governments. It has also found its way into popular culture, appearing in TV shows like The Big Bang Theory and movies like A Beautiful Mind.
>
> Overall, game theory provides insights into how people make decisions in different circumstances and helps predict outcomes based on individual actions.

## Key concepts within game theory

> [!ai] AI
>
> 1. Players: Game theory involves players who make decisions based on their own interests and preferences.
> 2. Payoffs: Game theory also involves payoffs, which represent the outcome of a player's decision.
> 3. Strategies: Players in a game must choose a strategy, or a series of decisions that they will make throughout the game.
> 4. Nash equilibrium: This is a concept in game theory that describes a situation where no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy given that all other players keep their strategies unchanged.
> 5. Dominant strategy: A dominant strategy is one that provides the best outcome for a player regardless of the choices made by other players.
> 6. Prisoner's dilemma: This is a classic example in game theory where two individuals may not cooperate even if it is in both of their best interests to do so, due to distrust or uncertainty.
> 7. Zero-sum games: These are games where one player's gain is equal to another player's loss, meaning that the total payoff for all players adds up to zero.
> 8. Cooperative games: These are games where players can work together to achieve mutual benefits, rather than acting solely in their own self-interest.
> 9. Game trees: Game trees are visual representations of the possible outcomes and decisions that can be made within a game, helping players understand how different strategies may lead to different outcomes.
> 10. Mixed strategies: Mixed strategies involve randomizing decision-making, such as flipping a coin or rolling dice, in order to reduce predictability and increase potential payoffs.

## Positive sum games

> [!ai] AI
> Positive sum games are games in which the total gains of all players combined exceed the total losses. In other words, these are games where it is possible for all players to win and there is no zero-sum outcome.

> Examples of positive sum games include trade negotiations, where both parties can benefit from the exchange of goods and services, and cooperation in a team sport, where each player's strengths complement those of others on the team.
>
> Positive sum games are important in game theory because they highlight the potential benefits of cooperation and mutual gain. In contrast, zero-sum games, where one player's gains come at the expense of another's losses, often lead to conflict and competition. By understanding positive sum games and finding ways to create them, individuals and organizations can achieve greater success through collaboration and teamwork.
