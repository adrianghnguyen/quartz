Its central unit is a nerve cell also known as neurons - with the human brain containing about 100 billion neurons.

They are the basic information messengers of the brain, sending electrical and chemical signals for information transmission. Different types of neurons will do perform different activities based on their specialization. For example, motor neurons will focus on movement, while other sensory neurons will focus on senses. We also have neurons specialized for unconscious processes.

Neurons are composed of the following:^[Basics, B. (2002). The life and death of a neuron. Office of Communications and Public Liaison, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke: Bethesda, MD, USA.]

| Neural unit component | Role in neurons                                                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cell body             | Contains cell nucleus (controls cell activity and genetical material) |
| Axons                 | Sends signals                                                          |
| Dendrites             | Receives signals                                                       |

## Types of neurons

There are three types of neurons:^[https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-life-and-death-neuron#:~:text=A%20neuron%20has%20three%20basic,contains%20the%20cell's%20genetic%20material.]
1.  **Sensory neurons** carry information from the sense organs (such as the eyes and ears) to the brain.
2.  **Motor neurons** control voluntary muscle activity, such as walking and talking, and carry messages from nerve cells in the brain to the muscles.
3.  Other neurons, all of which are called **interneurons.**

## Difference between axons and dendrites?

Axon passes nerve impulses **away** from the cell body (transmission) while dendrites pass nerve impulses **towards** the cell body (receiving). They are essentially communication modules for the neurons.

## State of neural network processing capacity to the human brain

> [!NOTE] Neural depths of LLMs
> Talking about [[REF Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early experiments with GPT-4|Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early Experiments
> with GPT-4]] - I believe our current generative AI models have a much lower of neurons in terms of processing capacities.
