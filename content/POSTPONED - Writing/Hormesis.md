## What is hormesis?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Hormesis is a biological phenomenon where exposure to low levels of a stressor, such as radiation or toxins, can actually stimulate beneficial responses in an organism. The concept of hormesis suggests that small doses of stress can be beneficial for an organism's health and longevity, while high doses can be harmful or even lethal. Hormesis has been observed in various biological systems, including plants, animals, and humans. Some proponents of hormesis suggest that it may have implications for medical treatments and environmental regulation. However, the exact mechanisms underlying hormetic responses are still being studied and debated within the scientific community.
