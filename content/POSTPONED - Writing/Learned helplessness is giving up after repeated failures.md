## Origins of studies on learned helplessness by Martin Seligman

> Learned helplessness was first studied by American psychologist Martin Seligman in the 1960s. Seligman conducted experiments with dogs, using electric shocks to condition them to associate a particular action or situation with pain. Over time, the dogs learned that they were unable to escape the shocks, leading them to become passive and exhibit signs of helplessness, even when given the opportunity to escape later on.
