As wealth increases, health care gets better, education takes longer, people start having fewer children. As a result, we nurture them much more carefully and protect them more carefully, which is probably a key factor in lower birth rate.

> The slow-life strategy is a lifestyle approach that emphasizes taking things slowly and mindfully, prioritizing quality over quantity and focusing on experiences rather than material possessions. It involves simplifying one's life, reducing stress, and fostering deeper connections with oneself, others, and the world around us. This approach can be applied to various aspects of life, including work, relationships, hobbies, and daily routines. The slow-life strategy encourages people to live in the moment and savor the simple pleasures of life while avoiding the constant busyness and distractions of modern society.

It sits in contrast to other evolutionary psychology paradigms, which states to make a lot of children and they have to learn how to be independent.
