## Zero-shot learning

> [!ai] AI
>
Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where a model can recognize and classify objects or concepts it has never seen before. Instead of being trained on a specific set of data, the model is given a description or attributes of the new object, and it uses its understanding of related concepts to make a prediction. This approach allows for more generalization and flexibility in the model's capabilities, as it can apply its knowledge to new situations without requiring additional training data.
