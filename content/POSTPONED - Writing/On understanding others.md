# On understanding others

#status/postponed

I think that to understand others you should look at the following sources of information:
1. What's their source of shame?
2. What's their psychological relationship with [[Avoid pursuing the four idols as primary life goals|money]]?
3. How were they raised? What is their relationship with their parent? Do they have any troubles what's the dynamic?
4. To what extent do they understand themselves and their behaviour? Have they asked themselves questions?

I feel like a lot of people don't really sit down and think about why they do things. Perhaps because it requires a lot of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]].  It also takes a lot of cognitive effort to get to that point.

With that being said, we should understand not everyone would share our values and we should respect individual differences. It just so happens that a lot of mine tend to be aligned towards the goal of self-improvement which would lead itself to asking myself why I do certain things.

One thing that confuses me a bit is that a lot of people don't seem to be…friends for a lack of better word with their inner voice. I feel like mine speaks to me all the time. What's interesting is that it just…vomits out. I'm not really conscious and it's just verbalizing my inner thoughts. For lack of a better word, it's like not having a filter. Perhaps this is the operative word. Is shame a filter?

It would definitely have societal value in terms of promoting social cohesion ada the [[Evolutionary Moral Psychology Theory|social cooperative theory]]. Shame would tell us - hey don't act this way in public as it might make others uncomfortable. Pretty confident that [[Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski]]  talks about this. I think just like anything else in life, it's a spectrum where we need to look for equilibrium in our behaviours aka homeostasis.

Homeostasis would be a concepted shared between buddhist philosophy and physics. My question to myself is why do I gravitate towards Buddhist philosophies primarily while the others ones…in their theology find little appeal to me. Maybe that's the problem? Theology for me means placing knowledge towards another and lack of critical reflection and ownership for one's action. We place the responsibility onto others, being prescribed (it's prescriptive). In a way, religion is like a social algorithm right? Do X things, promote social cohesion. I do see the evolutionary advantage to religion…but I feel like modern religion is more a way of classifying ourselves as an in-group. To see the other groups as 'the other', create all of the tribal dynamics which are still ingrained in us.

I feel like there's a lot of irony though. If we look to the original sources of the Bible and things like that, we see that modern Christians are actually very hypocritical. Or at least we can say the modern conservatives are. Maybe the proper term is actually evangelist conservative. The way I see it though is that this is kind of a symptom of capitalist systems. I don't exactly know why the right in American politics have coevolved to become coadapted with religion.

## The christian right and the alt-right

There's a lot of irony here because while i was searching for videos that maybe could begin explaining it, why a lot of sources are of poor quality. I don't think every opinion should be valued equally.
