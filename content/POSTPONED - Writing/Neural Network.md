> A neural network is a type of [[Machine Learning|machine learning algorithm]] inspired by the human brain's structure and functioning. It consists of interconnected nodes called neurons that process and transmit information. Each neuron takes in input, performs a mathematical operation on it, and passes the output to the next layer of neurons. By adjusting the connections between neurons, a neural network can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Its ability to handle complex patterns and nonlinear relationships makes it useful in various applications like image recognition and [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing]].
