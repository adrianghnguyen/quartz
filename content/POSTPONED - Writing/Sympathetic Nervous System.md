The sympathetic nervous system is activated in the **"fight-or-flight"** response in your body, which increases when you're stressed, in danger or physically active.

The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) is one of the three divisions of the autonomic nervous system.

The SNS has many functions that involve various types of adrenergic receptors and organ systems. When stimulated, spinal nerves connect the internal organs to the brain through this system.
