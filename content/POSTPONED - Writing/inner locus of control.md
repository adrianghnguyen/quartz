> Inner locus of control refers to an individual's belief that they have control over the events and outcomes in their life. People with an inner locus of control tend to attribute their successes and failures to their own actions and abilities, rather than external factors or luck. They believe that they are responsible for shaping their own destiny and have the power to make things happen. This mindset is often associated with greater [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|confidence]], motivation, and [[Resilience to overcome adversity and difficult circumstances|resilience]].

Individuals with this mindset are more likely to take initiative, set goals, and persist in the face of challenges. They tend to have a higher sense of [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|self-efficacy]] and believe that their efforts can make a difference.

They may feel helpless or powerless, as if they have little influence over their circumstances. This mindset can lead to a more reactive approach and feelings of victimization.
