## Continuous integration allows us to

Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of frequently and automatically merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared codebase. This involves using a version control system, such as Git, to manage code changes, and an automated build and testing system, such as Jenkins or Travis CI, to build, test, and validate the code changes. The goal of CI is to ensure that changes to the codebase are tested and validated quickly and often, to catch any issues early in the development process.

It's closely related as the predecessor to continuous deployment.
