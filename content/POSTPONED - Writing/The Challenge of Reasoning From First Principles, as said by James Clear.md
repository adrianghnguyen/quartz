From [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]]

# Obsessing about form over function in first principles thinking

> First principles thinking can be easy to describe, but quite difficult to practice. One of the primary obstacles to [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking]] is our tendency to optimize _form_ rather than _function_. The story of the suitcase provides a perfect example.
>
> In ancient Rome, soldiers used leather messenger bags and satchels to carry food while riding across the countryside. At the same time, the Romans had many vehicles with wheels like chariots, carriages, and wagons. And yet, for thousands of years, nobody thought to combine the bag and the wheel. The first rolling suitcase wasn’t invented until 1970 when Bernard Sadow was hauling his luggage through an airport and saw a worker rolling a heavy machine on a wheeled skid.
>
> Throughout the 1800s and 1900s, leather bags were specialized for particular uses—backpacks for school, rucksacks for hiking, suitcases for travel. Zippers were added to bags in 1938. Nylon backpacks were first sold in 1967. Despite these improvements, the form of the bag remained largely the same. Innovators spent all of their time making slight iterations on the same theme.
>
> What looks like innovation is often an iteration of previous forms rather than an improvement of the core function. While everyone else was focused on how to build a better bag (form), Sadow considered how to store and move things more efficiently (function).^[https://jamesclear.com/first-principles]
