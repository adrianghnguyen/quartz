Related to [[Traits and qualities of strong relationships]]

In order to [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|build strong relationships]], we should learn to treat others with dignity and respect. It's recognizing our [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|common humanity]] rather than believing in a sense of personal superiority which is often driven from a sense of [[Personal insecurities are personal fears or self-doubt|personal insecurity]]. 

We can do so by learning to:
- [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|Respect their opinions]]. It can often be a good strategy to learn more about their thoughts by asking interrogatives to really understand their perspective
- Understand that people may come from [[Different perspectives lead to diversity of knowledge|different ways of seeing the world]] and that both people can be right at the same time.
- They will treat us with respect, regardless of our background or beliefs. They do not engage in stereotyping or are too quick to judge. They will not make us [[Shame is feeling inadequate or unworthy of love and belonging|feel ashamed of who are we]].
