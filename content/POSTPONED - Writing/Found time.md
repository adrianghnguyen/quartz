## Spending windfall or found time on activities

[[10.1093_jcr_ucac032.pdf|Spending Windfall (“Found”) Time on Hedonic versus Utilitarian Activities.pdf]]

> - The research introduces the concept of found time, where consumers spend more of their free time on hedonic activities when it is unexpected. This pattern of found-time expenditure was observed in various contexts and using different measurements of time expenditure. Perceived busyness moderates the effect, with busy consumers less likely to spend found time on hedonic activities. The effect of found time on consumption is influenced by various factors and warrants further research.
> - The paper also discusses theoretical contributions related to hedonic versus utilitarian consumption and windfall gains. It points out that participants' open-ended responses revealed that both hedonic and utilitarian activities can include meaningful and frivolous activities. Content analyses from five studies showed that participants prioritized hedonic activities when they gained free time unexpectedly. Situational contexts, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influenced how people perceived and spent their found time.
> - Additionally, perceived busyness was identified as a moderator for how consumers spend found time and their tendency to spend it on hedonic activities. The findings have implications for consumers' enjoyment of hedonic consumption and may inform strategies for managers to encourage hedonic consumption. The insights from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to remain relevant in consumers' lives, especially given ongoing uncertainties and lifestyle changes.

What would be the relationship of this study with people's tendency to [[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism|avoid boredom]]?

### Limitations of the studies

  1. Empirical results based on consumers in North America and the United Kingdom, limiting generalizability
  2. Small amounts of free time tested in online platforms, which may have been treated as work by participants
  3. Cultural and socioeconomic factors not fully explored as potential influences on the use of found time
  4. Need for further investigation into the different forms and situations in which found time arises, and their impact on time expenditure
  5. Exploration of how found time is presented to consumers, and its framing as a gain or loss.

**Found time** also opens up a number of broader, thought-provoking questions such as:
- What is the relation of found time to health, happiness, and welfare, and is it more important than expected free time to these various aspects of life?
- How can a company generate profits from found time?
- Can consumers be coached to use found time in ways that benefit them so that they do not "waste" it?
- Is "wasted" found time really wasted, or does it carry some kind of value?
- Finally, there is an obvious parallel to found time: **lost time**, that is, time consumers thought they had which is suddenly "usurped" by other activities.
- How consumers perceive and treat such a loss, along with how such a loss differs from the way they treat a gain of found time, are also promising avenues to explore further.

Of course, it is beyond the scope of the present research to provide an exhaustive examination of potential factors that influence how consumers utilize found time. Nonetheless, we hope our work will spark much future research and discussion among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers on this vital and pervasive domain of time expenditure.
