> Euthanasia is the act of intentionally ending someone's life to relieve their suffering, usually due to a terminal illness or unbearable pain. It can be classified as either voluntary, where the person requests it themselves, or involuntary, where it is done without their consent. Euthanasia is a highly controversial and ethical issue, with arguments for and against its legalization. Supporters believe it offers a compassionate choice for those in extreme pain, while opponents argue that it goes against the sanctity of life and opens the door to abuse.

### How does euthanasia differ from assisted suicide?

> Euthanasia and assisted suicide are related concepts, but they have some important differences.
> Euthanasia refers to the act of intentionally ending someone's life by a third party, usually a doctor, with the explicit intention of relieving their suffering. This can be done in different ways, including administering a lethal dose of medication or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment.
> On the other hand, assisted suicide involves providing an individual with the means to end their own life, typically through the prescription of lethal drugs. In this case, the person themselves ultimately takes the action to end their life.
> The key distinction lies in who performs the final act. In euthanasia, it is typically a medical professional who directly causes death, while in assisted suicide, the individual carries out the act themselves with assistance from another person.
> Legally and ethically, euthanasia and assisted suicide are treated differently in various jurisdictions around the world. Some countries permit one or both practices under specific circumstances, while others consider them illegal.
