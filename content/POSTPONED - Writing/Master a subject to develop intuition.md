To [[Develop unique skills with a craftsman mentality|become an expert]], we need to immerse ourselves into a subject so thoroughly that we can form [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] about how things really work. According to [[Ultralearning by Scott Young|Ultralearning by Scott Young]], this is developing intuition about a subject and is a key in [[Learn rapidly through ultralearning|ultralearning]].

It's useful to understand where our knowledge and expertise is limited. By mastering a subject, we can learn to enlarge our [[Recognize your circle of competence|circle of competence]].

True mastery comes from a [[Analytical thinking is first-principles based|deep understanding of each fundamental component]], how they work and what [[The map is not the territory|the big picture looks like]]. We need to [[Dynamic systems theory|understand the holistic system]].

They immerse themselves in a subject so thoroughly that they form [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental models]] of how things really work. Mastery comes from a deep understanding of each component, how they’re inter-related, and what the big picture looks like.  Learn (i) the 4 rules to develop intuition, as well as (ii) the “[[Learn anything like Feynman|Feynman Technique]]” to understand any problem/idea (Scott Young named this approach after the [[Types of Giftedness and High Intellectual Potential|genius]] mathematician [[Richard Feynman]]).
