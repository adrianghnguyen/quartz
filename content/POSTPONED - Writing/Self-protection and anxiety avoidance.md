## Are we less likely to be open as a person when we are anxious?

Based on my understanding of the [[Theory of basic human values|Theory of basic human values]] and its revised model of the three rings, it seems like we have some aspects of self-protection and anxiety avoidance which kick in and prevent us from growing because we are more focused on the conservation of resources. We would have tendency for more [[Approach-avoidance behaviours|avoidance behaviours]] leading to reduced trust and have a harder time creating [[Secure attachment style have a foundation of positive beliefs in relationships|secure attachments]].

For example, when I'm thinking about myself, when I'm anxious, whatever, I will close myself off to the world and become more socially isolated and I will look to conserve resources and think perhaps other aspects such as achievement, dominance, traditions, and society and security because those help us conserve resources.

On the other hand, when we are not in an anxious environment, we are more likely to trend towards the other quadrant [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|values]] such as self-transcendence and openness to change.

I become more willing to explore and go out into the world and be nicer to people when I am not dealing with feelings of personal threats to me.

More saliently, recently, I was dealing with complex thoughts about the [[The trauma of abandonment|trauma of abandonment]] and because of that, I turned inwards and looked to cling on to things which are comfortable and what I know which can provide for me. I also feel like I started thinking about my career and things like that and I wonder if there's a link there.

As a result, I think it makes us less likely to be open to change and its [[Curiosity as my worldview|discovering new things]] when we are [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxious]].
