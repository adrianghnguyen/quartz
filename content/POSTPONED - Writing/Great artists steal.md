## The borrowing and reorganizing principle shows how we imitate others

> the _borrowing and reorganising principle_, suggests that most of the information acquired by and stored in long-term memory is borrowed from the long-term memories of other people. We imitate others, listen to what they say and read what they write. Once information is acquired from others, it is reorganised by us using information previously stored in our long-term memory (Bartlett [1932](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6435105/#CR3)).
