> The Overton Window is a concept in political theory that describes the range of ideas that are socially acceptable to discuss in a particular time and place. It refers to the boundaries of what is considered reasonable, normal, or acceptable in public discourse at any given moment. The term was coined by Joseph Overton, who argued that politicians and activists could shift the window by pushing for ideas just outside its current limits until they become mainstream.

This helps explain how things become normalized over time.
