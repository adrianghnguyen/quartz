> Product design thinking is a problem-solving approach that focuses on creating user-centered solutions. It involves empathizing with the users, defining their needs, ideating potential solutions, and prototyping and testing them. This [[Iterative process is a repetitive process|iterative process]] allows designers to understand user pain points and develop innovative products that meet their needs. By applying design thinking principles, product designers can create intuitive and impactful designs that enhance user experiences.

The process of [[Design thinking is about discovery through trial and error|design thinking]] for products:
1. Understand the user/problem through research and observation
2. Determine pain points, potential ideas and then ideate on the problem
3. Develop ways of [[Rapid experimentation|testing rapidly]] through lo-fi mockups
4. Repeat this process iteratively with [[Ladder of tests|progressing levels of commitment]]

## Design principles

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> 1. Simplicity: Keep the design clean, minimalistic, and easy to understand. Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements.
> 2. Consistency: Maintain a consistent visual style and layout throughout the design. Use the same fonts, colors, and icons to create a cohesive experience.
> 3. Hierarchy: Establish a clear hierarchy of information, with important elements being more prominent than less important ones. Use size, contrast, and placement to guide the user's attention.
> 4. Accessibility: Design with inclusivity in mind, ensuring that all users can access and interact with the design regardless of their abilities or disabilities. Consider factors like color contrast, font size, and screen reader compatibility.
> 5. Usability: Prioritize user needs and goals when designing an interface. Make sure it is intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear labels and instructions.
> 6. Feedback: Provide clear feedback to users when they interact with elements in the design. Visual cues like animations or changes in color can help users understand that their actions have been recognized.
> 7. Flexibility: Design should be flexible enough to accommodate different devices and screen sizes without compromising usability or visual appeal. Consider responsive design techniques to ensure a seamless experience across devices.
> 8. Visual Appeal: Create designs that are visually pleasing and engaging to the target audience. Use colors, typography, and imagery effectively to evoke emotions and enhance the overall user experience.
> 9. Balance: Achieve a harmonious balance between different design elements such as text, images, whitespace, and interactive elements. Avoid overcrowding or leaving empty spaces that make the design feel unbalanced.
> 10. Scalability: Design should be scalable so that it can grow and adapt as needed without losing its core functionality or visual integrity. Consider future expansion or additional features when designing interfaces.

## Design mindset

The design mindset emphasizes creative exploration and adaptability in addressing complex problems. Designers approach challenges that lack predefined solutions, embracing uncertainty and experimentation.

This mindset encourages curiosity, innovation, and the willingness to iterate and refine ideas. Design thinkers prioritize user-centered perspectives, empathy, and collaboration to develop solutions that resonate with human needs. Unlike the engineering mindset, the design mindset focuses on discovering new possibilities, leveraging iteration and feedback to arrive at solutions that may not have been initially apparent.
