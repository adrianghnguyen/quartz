# Changing deeply held beliefs and political views is challenging

#status/postponed

It's something that's being investigated by [[Political neuroscience uses neuroscience to understand mechanisms of political beliefs|political neuroscience]].

- weakly held beliefs
- practice humility to learn more [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|Learn to be wrong more often through humility.]]
- preconceived notions
- double loop learning is to constantly question underlying beliefs for veracity <- it needs to be combined with a mindset of [[Skepticism is keeping the door open to new ideas|skepticism]]

## Humans tend to hold onto beliefs despite contradictory facts

Humans tend to hold onto beliefs despite contradictory facts. Would it be related to [[The brain manages incongruent information by engaging in conflict monitoring|conflict monitoring]] mechanisms?

> The article discusses the irrationality of human reasoning and the factors that contribute to it. The author cites several psychological studies that demonstrate how people tend to hold on to their beliefs even when presented with contradictory evidence. The article suggests that reason developed in humans not to solve logical problems, but to navigate social interactions and maintain cooperative relationships. The author argues that reason is often influenced by [[confirmation bias]], where people selectively accept information that supports their beliefs and reject information that contradicts them. The article also explores the illusion of explanatory depth, which refers to people's tendency to overestimate their understanding of complex topics. The author suggests that collaboration and the division of cognitive labor among individuals have contributed to this phenomenon. The article concludes by highlighting the challenges in changing people's beliefs and promoting sound scientific understanding in a society driven by misinformation and alternative facts.

## Challenge to strong held political beliefs triggers negative emotions and threats to self-identity

Challenge to strong held political beliefs triggers negative emotions and threats to self-identity which may provide insight as to why it can be difficult to change people's mind at times.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> In a recent study published in Scientific Reports, researchers found evidence that our brains are wired to protect our strongly held political beliefs. The study involved 40 self-avowed liberals who were put in an fMRI scanner and challenged on their beliefs. The researchers found that when participants were challenged on their strongly held political beliefs, there was more activation in the parts of the brain associated with self-identity and negative emotions. This suggests that political beliefs are tied to our personal identities, and an attack on these beliefs is seen as an attack on the self. The study also found that participants were more likely to be influenced by politically charged arguments than nonpolitical ones. The results of this study shed light on why it is so difficult to change someone's mind on political topics and may provide insight into how to effectively challenge political beliefs.

## People who share the same political ideology tend to have the same neural activation patterns

A recent study^[de Bruin, D., van Baar, J. M., Rodríguez, P. L., & FeldmanHall, O. (2023). Shared neural representations and temporal segmentation of political content predict ideological similarity. Science Advances, 9(5), eabq5920.] led by researchers at Brown University suggests that people who share a political ideology have more similar neural patterns when processing political words, leading to divergent interpretations of the same information. The study found that individuals with the same ideology had greater neural synchrony and segmented new information in the same way. These neural fingerprints and segmentations contribute to the polarization of political beliefs, influencing how real-world political information is perceived. The researchers aim to use this understanding to combat polarization.

## Self-reported closed-mindedness between liberals and conservatives seems equal

> Research conducted by Professor Markus Kemmelmeier and Jesse Acosta explores the evolution of closed-mindedness in the United States. Their study, titled "The Changing Association between Political Ideology and Closed-Mindedness: Left and Right Have Become More Alike," examines the differences in self-reported closed-mindedness between liberals and conservatives over time. Historically, conservatives have identified as less open-minded and more resistant to change, while liberals tend to embrace uncertainty and advocate for change. However, the research shows that the disparity in closed-mindedness between the two groups has diminished significantly from 1948 to 2019. It suggests that the changing political landscape and increased acceptance of liberal values may have contributed to this convergence. Overall, the findings indicate that conservatives and liberals are now more similar in their self-described closed-mindedness.

> “People on the right are more focused on conscientiousness,” Kemmelmeier said. “They may be less likely to embrace uncertainty. They stick to traditions and routines.”

>

I honestly don't really like this, because close-mindedness to new experience doesn't really mean much. It's about the political beliefs in themselves. That's just one particular aspect. I don't really agree with how they interpreted this.

The fact that conservatives are unable to embrace uncertainty drive conservatives to preserve hierarchical power structures which is the problem in the first place.

## Conservative and liberal brains may have different cognitive structures

The field of political neuroscience examines the differences in brain structure and function between conservatives and liberals. Research^[ [Conservative and Liberal Brains Might Have Some Real Differences - Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/conservative-and-liberal-brains-might-have-some-real-differences/)] suggests that conservatives tend to value security and authority, while liberals are more comfortable with novelty and complexity. Brain imaging studies have found that the anterior cingulate cortex, involved in resolving conflicts, tends to be larger in liberals, while the amygdala, involved in regulating emotions, is larger in conservatives. However, these differences are probabilities and not certainties, and there is individual variability. The study of neural activity can provide insights into how partisanship affects our political behavior, including memory, reasoning, and perception of truth. Understanding these cognitive processes can help counteract the divisive effects of partisanship and promote a sense of national unity.

Would this be evidence that conservatives are more driven by feelings of threats and prone to [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety and uncertainty]]? Need to look at [Political conservatism as motivated social cognition | 5 | The Motivat](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315175867-5/political-conservatism-motivated-social-cognition-john-jost-jack-glaser-frank-sulloway-arie-kruglanski) one day.

## Relationship between political orientation and cognitive ability

The relationship between cognitive ability and political orientation is complex. Conservatism and cognitive ability seem to be negatively related. Does someone with less cognitive ability also have reduced [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|cognitive flexibility]]?

> The research^[Kemmelmeier, M. (2008). Is there a relationship between political orientation and cognitive ability? A test of three hypotheses in two studies. Personality and Individual Differences, 45(8), 767-772.] supports the idea that higher conservatism is linked to lower cognitive functioning, but conservative attitudes related to government control and low levels of political involvement may be associated with greater ability. Extremists, regardless of political ideology, tend to have greater [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive resources]]. The idea that those on the political fringes have lower cognitive ability is not supported. The causality between cognitive ability and political orientation is unclear. The research has small effect sizes at the individual level, but larger coefficients at the aggregated level. There may be criticism of ideological bias in the choice of cognitive variables, but the research uses standardized tests. The practical implications of the research are not yet clear, but it suggests a potential relationship between conservatism and career choice in language-intensive academic disciplines. Further research is needed to explore how conservatism and its cognitive correlates influence individual outcomes.
>
> This paper examined the relationship between cognitive ability and conservatism. The evidence showed that there is a negative correlation between conservatism and cognitive ability at both the individual and country levels. However, the causality of this relationship cannot be determined. Additionally, there are differences between individual-level and country-level factors of conservatism. Broad conservatism at the country level was found to be a stronger marker than IQ for measures of country success or failure, such as the Failed States Index and measures of wealth, the rule of law, democracy, and freedom. It is suggested that there may be a common dimension, such as affluence/poverty, that influences both cognitive ability and conservatism, along with other sociological and political variables. Further research is needed to explore these relationships.

## Personal political ideologies do not have neutral origins

The psychological foundation from which our personal ideologies are derived may not be neutral. We grow up in [[Our environment shapes our behaviour|environments which shape our behaviour]] which also extends to political beliefs and attitudes. [[Personality is shaped our environment|Personality is shaped environmental pressures and exposures.]]

As a result, [[Subjectivity is implied|subjectivity is often implied as humans have a tendency for bias]].

It looks like part of being liberal also means engaging in [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|deliberate thinking]] which requires a higher [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|cognitive load]]. I would also assume that it explains the higher capacity for empathy as well as [[Emotional regulation helps us manage emotional and stressful experiences|emotional self-regulation]] by people who tend to be less conservative in their political views.

> Without the means or motive to override an initial impulse that promotes conservative ideology, the political scales may be tipped toward the right of center and may provide a contributing explanation for what has been described as a conservative bias in American politics (e.g., Frank, 2004; Jost, 2006).
>
> This analysis also suggests that some forms of political ideology may result from [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|intentional and effortful correction]]. For example, Wänke and Wyer (1996) found that liberals scored higher than conservatives on the Attributional Complexity Scale (Fletcher, Danilovics, Fernandez, Peterson, & Reeder, 1986), an indicator that the former generate more complex and detailed (if not more effortful) explanations for the behavior of others. Skitka and her colleagues (Skitka et al., 2002; Study 4) analyzed interviews conducted for the 1987 National Election Studies and found that liberals were more than twice as likely as conservatives to correct an [[Fundamental Attribution Error|initial “person” attribution with a “situation” explanation]] in response to a question about government assistance. These correlational findings suggest that some instances of ideology may result from correction processes, overriding and adjusting initial conservative responses. Our experimental studies provide evidence of causal direction.

Interestingly enough, the study also indicates that conservative people are more likely to commit the [[Fundamental Attribution Error|fundamental attribution error (FAE) is attributing to malice what are circumstances]].

## [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|Heuristic thinking]] Promotes political conservatism

It looks like when [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]] is disrupted we switch over to the [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|type 1 thinking system]] which may promote political conservatism according to some evidence.

> When effortful, deliberate responding is disrupted or disengaged, thought processes become quick and efficient; these conditions promote conservative ideology.^[Eidelman, S., Crandall, C. S., Goodman, J. A., & Blanchar, J. C. (2012). Low-effort thought promotes political conservatism. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 38(6), 808-820.]
>
> When [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|effortful thinking]] was disrupted by rapid presentation of words and phrases related to political conservatism, endorsement of these terms increased. Endorsement of terms related to political liberalism was not affected by time pressure. Time pressure forces reliance on information processing that is quick and efficient (e.g., Bargh & Thein, 1985; Strack et al., 1982; Wegner & Erber, 1992). Study 3 joins Studies 1 and 2 in suggesting that this type of thinking promotes conservative ideology.

## Personal thoughts on conservative vs liberal brains

Political differences may be rooted in biological barriers and require [[Explicit reasoning is analytical and higher-level thinking|type 2 thinking]] to overcome. To use an open mind requires a lot of resources to overcome cognitive dissonance or possible motivated reasoning.

Additionally, there is a field emerging called political neuroscience but we have yet to fully understand how the brain works and operates when it comes to politics.

I would also be cautious to use this as evidence considering the rooted nature of politics to identity in the United States. It may be a western centric view. Its possible it's one of the primary factors in multicollinearity. Can we make links to theory of basic human values and moral foundations theory which seem to support that there may be irréconciliables differences on political ideologies?

## Relationship to justice and social decision

> In an area of research that emerged after our 2007 article was published, decision making was tied to depletion. Making decisions is [[Cognitive load is the amount of mental effort in processing information|psychologically taxing]] (Vohs et al., 2008), which can result in poorer decision making (Pocheptsova, Amir, Dhar, & Baumeister, 2009). Multiple investigations have followed up on that work, showing worse decision making and effortful behavior performance among people who recently had used self-control or made a series of decisions. Further work examining the effect of other executive functioning on ego depletion represents a promising new direction because such findings not only inform us about ego depletion but also elucidate our understanding of the components of the self.
