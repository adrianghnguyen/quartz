## What is a biological drive

A drive is a biological mechanism to keep an organism healthy. It works on principle of equilibrium like a thermostat. They work as motivational systems to move us to action. The uncomfortable states ("aversive") states drive us to perform actions to restorer a need. We can think of them as **survival mechanisms.**

Examples of biological drives:
- Thirst drives fluid consumption
- [[fatigue]] drives sleep
- thermoregulation drives shivering
- sweating leads taking off a sweater, or turning up the thermostat
