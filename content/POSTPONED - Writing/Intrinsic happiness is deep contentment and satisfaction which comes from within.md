> Intrinsic happiness refers to a deep sense of contentment and satisfaction that comes from within oneself, rather than relying on external circumstances or material possessions. It is a state of being where one feels fulfilled and at peace, regardless of the ups and downs of life. Intrinsic happiness is often associated with qualities such as gratitude, self-acceptance, and a strong sense of purpose. It is a lasting form of happiness that can be cultivated through practices such as mindfulness, self-reflection, and connecting with one's values and passions.
