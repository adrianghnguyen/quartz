# Life can be complicated and its various metaphors

#status/postponed

Related to [[Embracing life with amor fati according to Nietzche]]

Life can be complicated at times. That's why we should try to [[REF How To Simplify Your Life|make it as simple as possible]] or approach the difficult times with an attitude of [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|stoic acceptance]].

## Highest highs and the lowest of lows

Sometimes we might ride at very high peaks, on other days, we might fall into valleys of despair. That's why it can be so important for us to find our [[Create a support network to help provide emotional resilience|support network]] and learn to ignore the [[Dealing with our inner critic|inner critic]] at times. Surround ourselves with [[Warm and close relationships are dependable|people who we can depend upon]].

But overall, we should remain optimistic that our life is going for a positive trajectory and going up. We'll experience failures, but also great successes, and we should just do our best with what we can do.

Perhaps at times, we'll face [[Building resilience to rejection|rejection which we can overcome with resilience]]. Maybe our [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself]] becomes undermined.

Life is going to be messy. All we can do is strap in and do our best. Practice [[Non-zero day mindset|non-zero days]].

## This is life, by James Clear

> Life is a constant balance between giving into the ease of distraction or overcoming the pain of discipline. It is not an exaggeration to say that our lives and our identities are defined in this delicate balance. What is life, if not the sum of a hundred thousand daily battles and tiny decisions to either gut it out or give it up?
>
> This moment when you donâ€™t feel like doing the work? This is not a moment to be thrown away. This is not a dress rehearsal. This moment is your life as much as any other moment. Spend it in a way that will make you proud.

## Voyage of life

This was inspired by the Voyage of life painting series by Thomas Cole which depicts a pilgrim's journey though the river of life which was introduced in the [[Harvard course on managing happiness|Harvard course on happiness]].

The series of paintings is a metaphor for the journey that most of will encounter through life life.

## Life is more improvisation than engineering

Life is long and we'll need to improve and adjust plans accordingly.

> [[Engineering mindset|Engineering assumes that there is a right answer]], and that you have the knowledge and insight to consistently and reliably arrive at that answer. Life, however, does not work this way. We are venturing into uncharted territory, building a future that has never been done before. This means that we cannot rely on a predetermined path like a GPS. Instead, we navigate through life by trying things, learning from them, making adjustments, and trying again. It's like a long improvisational skit.
>
> In design, we often rely on improvisation because none of us truly know what will happen. We are all figuring it out as we go along. [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|Life design]], as we teach it, is about equipping you with the skills to navigate through life and find your way. It's about embracing the constant improvisation that is your life.
>
> There are many versions of you, but there is no single right version. All we need to do is discover a few good versions of you and embark on a fulfilling [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|life design journey]].
