## What is adaptive control in machine learning?

> Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with the development of algorithms and statistical models that can enable machines to learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. In adaptive control, machine learning can be used to develop controllers that can adapt to changing conditions in real-time.
>
> One common approach to using machine learning in adaptive control is to use it to develop models of the system being controlled, based on data from sensors or other measurements. These models can be used to predict how the system will behave under different conditions, and to generate control signals that will help the system achieve its desired behavior.
>
> Another approach is to use machine learning to develop control policies or strategies that can adapt to changing conditions. For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm could be used to train a controller to maximize a performance objective over time, while also learning to adapt to changes in the system or environment.
>
> Overall, machine learning can be a powerful tool for developing adaptive control systems that can learn and improve from experience, and that can adapt to a wide range of dynamic and uncertain conditions.^[ChatGPT]

Explained simply: It's using machine learning ([[Machine Learning]]) techniques in regards to adaptive control to enhance **regression** and **predictive modeling**.

## How to begin learning machine learning for adaptive control

[[Vlad Pripotnev]] recommends me starting with the following topics to understand

- Any intro to regression
- to Fourier transforms,
- to ODEs (ordinary [[Differential Equation]])
- to linear systems
- control theory would be a good place to start

In terms of start order, he recommends:

1. getting a general idea of ODEs
2. conceptual understanding of what a Fourier transform is and what it represents,
3. then you can get into [[Control Systems Theory]]
