> Conversational AI refers to the technology that enables computers or machines to understand and engage in human-like conversations. It combines natural language processing, machine learning, and other techniques to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses. The goal of conversational AI is to create more interactive and personalized experiences for users when interacting with machines or devices. Examples of conversational AI include virtual assistants like Siri, chatbots, and voice-activated systems.

> CAI is a technology that communicates with humans by tapping into “[large volumes of data, machine learning, and natural language processing to help imitate human interactions](https://www.ibm.com/topics/conversational-ai).”
