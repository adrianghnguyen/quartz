## Overview of the parasympathetic nervous system

The parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS) is one of the three divisions of the autonomic nervous system.

It is responsible for relaxing the body after periods of stress or danger and helps run life-sustaining processes like digestion when you feel safe and relaxed. The PSNS is *continuously active* and works in conjunction with the [[Sympathetic Nervous System|sympathetic nervous system]] to maintain homeostasis in the body. When activated, it can help lower stress levels and promote relaxation, which is why it's sometimes called the "rest and digest" state.
