A common mistake we may make when it comes to [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]] is thinking that the *stakes are too high* which may be inaccurate. It's important for our own sake to learn how to [[Use the disputation strategy to overcome pessimism through facts|dispute this pessimism]].

We are under the false pretense that if we do something wrong, then it's [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|catastrophic]]. Most of the time, when it's wrong it's only wrong and no more. There is no need for [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|excessive self-criticism]] and it's [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|better seen]] as a [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|learning opportunity]].

It's important to become overly attached to [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|how others may perceive us]] if we make a mistake - that leads to [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|human suffering]] and a general [[Fear of failure|fear of failure]]. Most of the time, we might feel rejected, or feel like our ego takes a hit, a reduced self-evaluation - but hey you're still alive and breathing right? [[Failure is never definitive|Failure is never definitive.]]

[[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|Be kind to yourself if you make mistakes.]] We need to remind ourselves of the true rational stakes rather than jumping into conclusions about a scenario. It can be easy to jump towards [[Automatic thoughts are suggestions not orders|automatic thoughts]], and [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|negative assumptions]] which most likely stem from the [[You are not your inner critic|inner critic and past voices]].

You can figure it out. [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|I believe in you]]. [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|Breakdown complex problems]] and solve it little by little. Most things aren't so [[nature of fear|scary]] once you reduce them into smaller things - just like in [[Complex structures should emerge from simple systems|Gall's law (systems law)]].

## Good positive self-talk reminders when we make mistakes

Instead, perhaps these are [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|good reminders to tell ourselves]] that [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|mistakes]] aren't that [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|big of a deal]] in most cases when something goes wrong:
- In the grand scheme, this isn't so important.
- This does not matter that much.
- I'll just laugh it off
- I'm going to learn (as the famous Julia Child would say)

It's about having a good read on the situation and realizing that it's not life or death.
