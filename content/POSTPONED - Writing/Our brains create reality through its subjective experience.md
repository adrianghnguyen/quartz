# Our brains create reality through its subjective experience

#status/postponed

According to Lisa Feldman Barrett, our world is interpreted through sensory signals which is then related to our brain. [[Signal integration|It integrates these signals into a cohesive whole]] using past experiences to help us predict and behave within the world. [[Human brains constantly prospect the future|Our brain is constantly seeking to make predictions]] with [[Emotions are based on past experiences and seek to help us adapt to future events|emotions playing a key role in adapting to future events]].

The mind experiences reality through a filtered lens.

## Reverse inference problem

> The reverse inference problem refers to the challenge of inferring specific mental states or cognitive processes based on observed brain activity. It arises from the fact that a single brain region can be involved in multiple mental processes, making it difficult to determine the precise cognitive function underlying a given neural activation pattern. Reverse inference is often used in neuroimaging studies to make inferences about cognitive processes based on patterns of brain activity, but it is limited by the ambiguity of neural activation and the potential for multiple interpretations. Despite its limitations, reverse inference can still provide valuable insights into the relationship between brain and behavior.

## Evidence on reality perception from Lisa Feldman Barett

> In her talk titled "Your brain doesn’t detect reality. It creates it.," Lisa Feldman Barrett discusses the intricate relationship between human perception and reality. She highlights that the way we experience reality is not a direct reflection of objective truth but is shaped by sensory signals received by our brain. Barrett presents the metaphor of the brain as being confined within a dark, silent box (the skull), receiving sensory signals from the external world. These signals are outcomes of changes in the world, and the brain has to infer their causes based on past experiences, a process known as the 'Reverse inference problem.' This prediction-based model of the brain involves categorizing instances from the past to anticipate future experiences. Importantly, Barrett suggests that the brain constructs categories not solely based on sensory attributes, but also on abstract, multimodal summaries of patterns of features. This ability allows humans to create 'Social reality,' where shared meanings and functions are imposed on objects, such as money or borders. Barrett's research examines the hypothesis that many psychological categories are forms of social reality, shaped by collective agreements. She also touches on the brain's capacity for imagination, which enables it to synthesize new experiences. However, this imaginative capacity can also lead to difficulties in staying present, necessitating the cultivation of control over the balance between being constrained by the external world and being free from it.

Lisa's metaphor for the brain being confined in a dark box is similar to the remote pilot metaphor

### Remote pilot metaphor aka Gundam suit for the brain

Another way of framing the mind-body concept is that the brain which is the primary player in our actions is the pilot while the rest of the system being our  body (a collection of nerves with sensory information) as the mech suit by which we conduct our actions.

Sensory information also known as [[Memory is processed information|memories]] can be thought of as the input to makes decisions while resulting actions, conscious or unconscious are the [[Inputs are transformed into outputs|output]].

An intermediary layer would be all our [[Brains are biased by nature|cognitive biases]], [[Bayesian Decision Theory|ingrained beliefs]] or other body memories such as traumas by which the sensory information is [[Process of communication|filtered]]. Our bodies are incredible at gathering and processing information whether it be conscious or unconscious.

## We experience the world through our subjective sensory interpretation

 The process of organizing all these pieces of [[Brains organize information into schemas|information]] is called [[Probabilistic generative model|probabilistic generative model]]. Our knowledge of the world can be considered a map of how we experience 'true information'. [[The map is not the territory|The map is not the territory]] and as a result is imperfect - it lacks nuance and may even be misleading. Humans are flawed in this way as result of our [[Implicit reasoning uses heuristics|implicit reasoning]].

> It means that information—anything you see, hear, smell, touch, or taste—goes first to your emotional brain, where prior learning (possibly about lemons or little rat jackets, possibly about [[Appreciate your body to learn to love it|body image]] or sexual disgust) plus your present brain state ([[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|stress]], love, [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|self-criticism]], disgust, etc.) combine to shape the initial decisions your brain makes about whether to move toward or away from that information. That initial decision sets off a series of expectations about what else might be true and what might happen next.

When there is a mismatch between the map and the terrain, our brains try to force its reconciliation through the process of [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]].

1. Trust the terrain. If you experience [[Cognitive dissonance seeks to resolve mental inconsistency|cognitive dissonance]], chances are your [[The map is not the territory|map is wrong]] - not the terrain.
2. Everyone's map is unique as a result of their unique [[Personality is shaped our environment|upbringing]].
3. Learn to let go through [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|non-judgement]]
