## The future cannot be controlled

The future is something that none of us can control - only [[Practice stoicism to develop acceptance and resilience in the face of adversity|our internal state is something we can control]]. Maybe that's something the [[What the Buddha Taught by Walpola Rahula|Buddha sought to teach us]] - do not pursue but let the flow of life guide you along. [[Mindfulness is presence in the moment|Go with the flow]]. See the future as something distinct to you - a mind-object which we can interact but remains outside. We play, observe and look at it with curiosity - but it is not ours to hold and grasp.

The best thing we can do is learn to [[Show up and at least try your best|show up]].

## Humans are not equipped to anticipate all scenarios

Why are we not great at them? 

For one, it's impossible for us to anticipate all possible scenarios in a [[Dynamic systems theory|complex and ever-changing environment]]. Time is also a factor in itself which moves all the pieces in a [[Self-organization is the complex behaviors of multiple individual interactions|self-organizing]] manner. What we try to control here today impacts the tomorrow. Perhaps it's better to [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|control one's energy levels and direct them accordingly]].

[[View challenges as opportunities|View its upcoming challenges]], and whichever it throws at you as its own delight. Variety spurs the mind to develop and grow in new ways while stagnancy implies death. Homeostasis of curiosity leads to [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|rot of the mind]].

## Humans are not great at long-term decisions

Humans are probably not very good at making long-term decisions. We have various psychological (cognitive?) systems which have evolved to help us make better decisions: retrospection and anticipation. Taken to their [[Find your niche|overadaptative extreme]], they become [[Depression|depression]] and [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] in respective order.

It's important to remember this to [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|be kind to myself]] if I feel like I have taken a wrong turn in [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|major life decisions]].

### Long-termism

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Long-termism is a philosophical and ethical approach that focuses on the long-term consequences and impacts of our actions. It emphasizes the importance of considering the future generations and their well-being when making decisions and setting priorities. Long-termism argues that short-term thinking often leads to negative consequences, such as environmental degradation and social inequalities. It calls for adopting strategies and policies that promote sustainability, fairness, and long-term benefits for all.

There's some criticism to be leveraged about this - most people are not great at making long-term decisions.

## Finding purpose can help us stay on a path

Find a purpose - stick to it. Trust your [[Values guide our behaviours like a lighthouse|principles]]. What is mine? To advance human cognition and provide better tools of understanding the human mindâ€¦by giving better tools to therapists to improve mental health?
