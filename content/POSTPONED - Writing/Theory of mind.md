## Theory of mind

> Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states such as beliefs, emotions, desires, intentions, and knowledge to oneself and others, and to understand how they affect behavior and communication [Wel92]. It includes the basic task of reflecting on someone else’s mental states, and the more advanced task of reflecting on someone’s reflection of someone else’s mental state (and so on). An example of the former skill is is needed to answer the question “What does Alice believe?”, while an example of the latter is needed to answer “What does Bob think that Alice believes?” Theory of mind is essential for effective communication and cooperation with other intelligent agents, as it allows one to infer their goals, preferences, motives, and expectations, and to adjust one’s own actions and utterances accordingly. Moreover, theory of mind is also important for learning from others, as it enables one to interpret their feedback, advice, and demonstrations.^[Bubeck, S., Chandrasekaran, V., Eldan, R., Gehrke, J., Horvitz, E., Kamar, E., … & Zhang, Y.
