# Adopt a mindset of experimentation to think like a scientist.

Thinking like a scientist, based on [[REF It doesnâ€™t matter if you fail. It matters how you fail by Amy Edmonson|Amy Edmonson]]'s description, involves approaching challenges with a methodical and hypothesis-driven mindset.

## Scientists build a tolerance for failure and mistakes

Scientists learn to develop a tolerance for failure and mistakes, especially when working at the [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|boundaries of knowledge]]. Adopting this approach can help me [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe perspective]] on feeling like [[Failure is never definitive|failure is the end]].

Perhaps a [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|kinder way]] of phrasing things is to deeply understand that I may have ventured into unknown territory to try out something new. That's part of how we [[Personal growth is becoming a better person|grow as a person]].

Instead, after a certain level of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|introspection]] if it was an intelligent failure - did I learn something from this experiment? If yes - then perhaps there was [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|meaning in that experience]]

## Testing and iteration moves us closer to desired objectives

[[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|Being wrong]] helps lead us closer to new discoveries - as simple and silly as a new haircut to something like discovering something world-changing like a brand new cure.

We should be aiming high and doing something we're not 100% sure will work - there is uncertainty. That's what happens when we operate outside of our comfort zone such as [[Opposite signal strategy to do what is uncomfortable|doing something different]].

- What is it I'm really hoping to do?
- What's the progress I'd love to make

## Thinking like a scientist in a nut shell

It's a simple [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] for learning to think like a scientist.

1. Define the problem and objectives
2. Research information and identify gaps
3. Formulate a hypothesis and testable strategies
5. Execute Controlled Experiments
6. Learn, Iterate, and Apply

## The principles of thinking like a scientist

Thinking like a scientist is about approaching problem-solving with the following principles:

1. **Hypothesize and Experiment:** Scientists hypothesize about unexplored aspects, then design experiments to test these hypotheses. Similarly, in everyday scenarios, thinking like a scientist entails formulating hypotheses about goals or challenges and experimenting with potential solutions.
2. **Continuous Learning:** Scientists understand that failure is an inherent part of the learning process. Similarly, individuals adopting a scientific mindset embrace failures as opportunities for gaining new knowledge and insights.
3. **Goal-Oriented Thinking:** Scientists pursue specific goals and objectives. In personal and professional endeavors, thinking like a scientist involves clarifying one's objectives, understanding the progress desired, and working towards those goals.
4. **Structured Inquiry:** Scientific thinking involves structured inquiry. Individuals adopting this mindset ask themselves key questions, such as what they hope to achieve, what they currently know, and what knowledge gaps exist. This structured inquiry guides decision-making and problem-solving.
5. **Risk Management:** Scientists conduct experiments in controlled environments to manage risks effectively. Similarly, those thinking like scientists consider the level of risk associated with their actions, opting for experimentation in situations where the stakes are medium to low.

In essence, thinking like a scientist involves a disciplined and inquisitive approach to problem-solving, emphasizing experimentation, continuous learning, and goal-oriented thinking.

## Personal thoughts

Being a scientist is approaching experimentation with a [[Approach experimentation with joy and curiosity|sense of joy and curiosity]]. Scientists by nature train themselves to be resilient and the ability to tolerate failures - because they are informed and deliberate. As a result, their failures can be seen as making [[Intelligent failures are the result of intentional experiments|intelligent failures]].

Many of their experiments will go wrong - but this provides further information and knowledge which can drive their next hypothesis. [[All learning is dependent on feedback|All learning is dependent on feedback.]] It's about the lessons that these provide which make them meaningful.

When working at the [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge|boundaries of knowledge]], whether it be personal or scientific, we are most likely to be wrong. That's quite normal since it's venturing into unknown territory.
