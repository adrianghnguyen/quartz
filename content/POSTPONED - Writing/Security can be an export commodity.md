- There are security consumer, producers and exporters
- On a surface level, there might seem to be uneven exchanges in the international geopolitics market such as US-Japan
- In the olden days, annexation was an option while in recent times territorial acquisition through force/warfare is frowned upon
- The form of exchange can take many forms such as monopolization of economic markets, political influence on domestic policies, concessions, etc. The senior power is exchange security in exchange to extract value out of the junior/subordinate power.
- For example, the United States is a security exporter to Japan (an importer). Generation of this 'resource' is expensive - so nations often require good reasons to do so.
- If we bring it in terms of economics, some countries may have a comparative advantage in security production as a good, so others may choose to import it as it is not aligned with their political motivations or nation strengths.
