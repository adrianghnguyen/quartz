[Dopamine: What It Is, Function & Symptoms](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22581-dopamine#:~:text=Dopamine%20is%20a%20type%20of%20neurotransmitter%20and%20hormone.,mental%20health%20and%20neurological%20diseases.)

## What is the difference between tonic and phasic dopamine release?

> Behaviorally relevant stimuli are proposed to cause short-term activation of dopamine cell firing to trigger the phasic component of dopamine release. In contrast,Â tonic dopamine release is proposed to regulate the intensity of the phasic dopamine response through its effect on extracellular dopamine levels.

Tonic and phasic neuronal patterns are better described in neural activity patterns and activities ([[Types of neuron activity]]).

We know from [[Flow state is the ability to enter unconscious competence]] that dopamine is a precursor for driving motivation ([[Success requires time and patience]]).

## Dopamine stimulates eye growth

Exposure to sunlight stimulates production of dopamine within the retina helping regulate its growth and telling the eyeball to stop growing (leading to myopia in poor/insufficient light conditions).^[[Why so many people need glasses now - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAkFtka3UFw)]. According to leading theories, lack of sufficient light as well as indoor activities has led to an increase in myopia in current generations of children - leading to an increase in need of glasses in addition to higher risks of ocular diseases. Myopia may be more of a result of environmental factors despite the increase inheritability if a parent has it.

In Asian countries, due to competitive academic environments, children do not spend enough time in sunlight. Singapore has enacted a policy to encourage children to spend more time outside during school hours in the hopes of reversing this trend.
