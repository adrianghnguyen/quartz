# Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate

## Getting started in changing our minds is difficult due to inertia and ingrained beliefs

> Let’s suppose that you want the benefits of changing your mind. Getting started is hard, especially if the view you want to change is something huge, like your religious beliefs or your political ideology. It’s better to start with smaller ideas such as your fashion choices, or even your sports allegiances. Reconsider the things you have long taken for granted, and assess them as dispassionately as you can. Then, with these low stakes, change.

## Start small in changing your beliefs

> The point is not to deal in trivialities. [Research](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43261127-tiny-habits) on goal setting clearly shows that starting small teaches you how to change and break habits. Then, you can scale this self-knowledge up to the bigger areas of your life in which, you secretly suspect, you might just be wrong. At that point, with your new skills in hand, the adventure of finding truth starts.

## Flip-flopping is okay

> If you master these techniques, there might be critics who say you are a flip-flopper, or wishy-washy. To deal with this, take a lesson from the great economist Paul Samuelson. In 1948, Samuelson published what might be the most celebrated [economics textbook](https://www.mheducation.com/highered/product/economics-samuelson-nordhaus/M9780073511290.toc.html) of all time. As the years went by and he updated the book, he changed his estimate of the inflation level that was tolerable for the health of the macroeconomy: First, he said 5 percent was acceptable; then, in later editions, 3 percent and 2 percent, prompting the Associated Press to run an article titled “Author Should Make Up His Mind.” In a television interview after Samuelson was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1970, he gave his [answer](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/22/keynes-change-mind/) to the charge: “When events change, I change my mind. What do you do?”

> In the pursuit of happiness, you can do this too. When events change, you acquire new information, or someone simply makes a great argument, go ahead and change your mind, and do it openly. It might seem like a tough ask at first. But trust me: It will go from hard to fun. You have nothing to lose but your moat.

We all grow up with [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|our own personal gardens]] and it can take time to nurture and grow different thoughts. Knowledge is cumulative and we should learn to practice [[An educated mind is cognitively flexible|cognitive flexibility]] when we are wrong by [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|being humble]].
