> The amygdala is a small, almond-shaped structure located deep within the brain. It is part of the limbic system, which is involved in emotions, memory, and motivation. The amygdala plays a crucial role in processing and regulating emotions, particularly fear and aggression. It also helps to consolidate memories by attaching emotional significance to them. Dysfunction or damage to the amygdala can lead to emotional and social difficulties.

The amygdala is a small almond-shaped structure located in the temporal lobe of the brain. It plays a key role in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety.
