# Develop better strategies over brute forcing

I think that often times, we prioritize a simple form [[Grit is being determined and resilient to achieve long-term goals|grit]] such as bashing our head in against the wall, or putting in more effort. That's not a very sustainable strategy and is limited in its ability to scale. Better strategies can be integrated into [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|daily habits]] while energy is more of a finite resource which can only be replenished through sources such as sleep.

- Processors went over to multithreading and multiple cores over simply increasing processor speeds
- Often new scientific breakthroughs come from new paradigms
- You are victim to [[Diminishing return|diminishing returns]] once you've optimized most of the problem
- Being more efficient through [[Think strategically|strategic thinking]] allows you to make best use of your personal resources as your [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|personal energy]] otherwise you risk [[Emotional and physical burnout|burnout]]. It's simply not sustainable.

In human exercise science, we see that endurance efforts require us to stay away from high intensity efforts otherwise we risk excessive stress can cause permanent or long-term damage onto the system. For example, in cycling or running, most of your training efforts should be spent in [[REF Most of Your Training Should Be EASY! Polarized Training With Dr. Stephen Seiler|zone 2 training]] to provide sustainable levels of training without injury or [[Emotional and physical burnout|burnout]].

If we are competing for limited resources, using a [[brute force strategy]] is often poor in terms of game theory as it is zero-sum. If two people are putting out max effort assuming equal level of skill, then you're back to where you started.

Developing a better strategy is superior than replicating the brute effort. However, it is difficult and requires creative thought or [[Cognitive flexibility is adapting our thoughts and beliefs as appropriate|cognitive flexibility]] to think of new ways of playing the metagame.

When learning something new, rote memorization, a type of brute force learning strategy, is one of the most poor ways to learn. Instead, superior strategies include teaching to others such as in the [[Learn anything like Feynman|Feynman method]], [[Writing to learn|learn through writing]], etc.

## Zero-sum game

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> A zero-sum game is a type of game where the gain of one player is directly offset by the loss of another player, resulting in a total balance of zero. In other words, the total value or resources in the game remains constant, and any gain by one player must be at the expense of another player. Examples of zero-sum games include competitive sports and gambling, where a win for one person means a loss for another. Zero-sum games are in contrast to non-zero-sum games, where both players can potentially benefit or lose without canceling each other out.

## Horizontal vs vertical scaling

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> Horizontal scaling refers to the process of adding more machines or instances to a system in order to increase its capacity. This involves distributing the workload across multiple machines, which allows for better performance and scalability. On the other hand, vertical scaling involves increasing the resources (such as CPU, RAM, or storage) of a single machine to handle more workload.
>
> While horizontal scaling offers better fault tolerance and scalability, vertical scaling can be more cost-effective for smaller systems with limited growth potential. Ultimately, the choice between horizontal and vertical scaling depends on the specific needs and constraints of a system.
