> Evolution is the process of change in all forms of life over generations. It is driven by genetic variation, natural selection, and environmental factors. Over time, species can adapt and develop new traits that improve their chances of survival and reproduction. Evolutionary processes have led to the incredible diversity of life on Earth, with species continuously evolving and branching off into new forms.
