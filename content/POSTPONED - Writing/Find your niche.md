> Niche refers to the specific area or role that an organism occupies within its ecosystem. It describes how an organism interacts with its environment and other species. Each organism has a unique niche that includes its habitat, food sources, and interactions with predators and competitors. Niche specialization allows different species to coexist by reducing competition for resources. Understanding an organism's niche is important for studying its behavior, population dynamics, and ecological relationships.



## There exists many kinds of niche

-   [Developmental niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_niche "Developmental niche"), a concept for understanding the cultural context of child development
-   [Ecological niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche "Ecological niche"), a term describing the relational position of an organism's species
-   [Niche differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_differentiation "Niche differentiation"), in ecology, the process by which competing species use the environment differently in a way that helps them to coexist
-   [Niche market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market "Niche market"), in economics, the process by which competing companies divide the market in a way that helps them to coexist
-   [Niche (protein structural motif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_(protein_structural_motif) "Niche (protein structural motif)")
-   [Stem-cell niche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-cell_niche "Stem-cell niche"), the necessary cellular environment of a stem cell

## Overuse and overfitting

- Animals who over specialize fail
- You need to adapt to niche but too much and you can't respond to other factors.
- Sensory fatigue such as the nose getting tired.
- Melatonin stops being produced if you abuse it.
- What is the opposite? Sensory deprivation. Why and how might it be beneficial?
- Overfitting is linked to [[Machine Learning|machine learning]] and the data learning processes?
