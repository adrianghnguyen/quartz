## Many of us never set goals - and for the ones who do, never achieve them

Apparently, many of understand the importance of [[Purpose in life|setting goals in life]] but supposedly, [[Common humanity is recognizing our shared experiences|80 percent of us]] never set personal goals^[Source needed? https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/8259/fail-achieve-goals#:~:text=Fear%20of%20success%20and%2For,will%20think%20negatively%20of%20them. ] From there, 70 percent of us will fail to accomplish the goals we set for ourselves.

There are two types of goals, action-oriented ("do goals") and personal-development oriented goals ("be goals").

## Common roadblocks and traps to achieving our goals

Accoridng to Douglas Vermeeren, here are the most common reasons why we may avoid pursuing our goals.

- [[Fear of failure|Fear of success and/or failure]]
	- We may be afraid of success and failures because of self limiting beliefs and low self esteem. We don't believe in our potential. We don't feel like we're worthy of achieving success due to a [[Lack of self-confidence creates personal doubt and fear|lack of self-confidence]].
- Lack of understanding about the [[Use the SMART goal framework to pursue objectives and goals|goal-setting process]]
	- We don't know how to set proper goals and to do goal-setting as a process
- Lack of commitment to the goal
	- We're not truly committed to the goal - perhaps because deep down, we know it may not be an [[Create meaningful goals which are authentic to you|authentic goal]]
- Inactivity
	- After beginning the work, we may simply stop putting in effort. [[Show up and at least try your best|Showing up and trying your best consistently]] is what truly matters.
- [[Analysis paralysis|Analysis paralysis]]
	- We seek too much information before simply [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|doing the work]]. We get bogged down in [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]] and live in constant anxiety of not knowing all the answers. There's a cutoff point where we need to move from analysis to action even if we possess [[Optimal stopping|incomplete information]]. 
- Lack of a real destination
	- We may not know where our objectives should lead us. I think it's important to consider this in [[My ideal life|my ideal life]].
- Failing to plan
	- Even for those who understand how to set goals properly such as using [[SMART goals|SMART goals]], we don't take into account the personal resources which are available to use make us of our key [[Signature strengths|personal strengths]].
- Having too many goals
	- We may have too many goals - leading us to be distracted. Learn to [[Focus on the essential like Warren Buffet|focus on the essential like Warren Buffet]] and cut off what may lead us astray. It's easy to be tempted by low-hanging fruits. [[Remove distractions through minimalism|Stick to the bare essential]].
	- I'm thinking of the advice from [[REF How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why|How to Pick a Career (That Actually Fits You) — Wait But Why]] and how we should limit our yearning hierarchy. 
- Feeling unworthy of the end result
- Lack of motivation to change
- Some of us lack of motivation to change. Perhaps it's because of a psychological block which prevents us from pursuing [[Personal flourishing is the state of optimal psychological well-being and functioning|personal flourishing]], and is a form of subconscious avoidance. We

## Goal-avoidance

Why do we fail to achieve goals? What creates goal-avoidance?

- Maybe research motivational theories
	- [[Humans are motivated to grow]]? We inherently want to learn and achieve [[Non-zero day mindset|non-zero days]]
- Why do we sometimes avoid goals or doing what is important to us?
- [[Superficial boredom is the most common state of boredom and a form of escapism]]
- We may be feeling stressed preventing us from [[Make informed decisions|making good decisions]]
- Lack of motivation…perhaps because they are not truly [[Create meaningful goals which are authentic to you|meaningful goals]]?
