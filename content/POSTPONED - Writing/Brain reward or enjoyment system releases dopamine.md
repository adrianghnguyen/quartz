Enjoyment is associated with the release of dopamine in the [[Nucleus accumbens|NAc]], which is activated by pleasurable stimuli such as food, social interactions, or drugs. The VTA releases dopamine into the NAc in response to these stimuli, causing feelings of enjoyment and pleasure. It's the closest analogue to the reward system.

> The enjoying mechanism is the “Yes!” or “No!” in your brain—it assesses the “**hedonic impact**” of a stimulus: Does it feel good? How good? Does it feel bad? How bad? When you put a drop of sugar water on the tongue of a newborn, the infant’s enjoying system sets off fireworks; sugar is innately rewarding—we’re born ready to enjoy sweet tastes. Salt is not.

> Genital sensations are, likewise, innately rewarding—fetuses have been known to masturbate in utero. Elbow sensations, not so much. **This one system manages all forms of enjoying**, including sweet tastes, sexual sensations, the perception of beauty, the joy of love, and the thrill of winning.

## Brain's reward system

> The hedonic treadmill occurs psychologically due to a phenomenon called adaptation.

> One reason for this adaptation is known as the "set point theory." According to this theory, individuals have a [[Happiness is a homeostatic process|baseline level of happiness]] or well-being that they naturally revert to after experiencing significant life events, both positive and negative. This set point acts as a psychological thermostat that regulates our overall level of happiness.
>
> Another reason for the hedonic treadmill is the concept of comparison. [[Social comparison|Humans tend to compare their current circumstances and achievements with those of others or their own past experiences]]. This comparison can lead to a constant striving for more success, [[Acquisition centrality is mistakenly believing that materialism leads to happiness|material possessions]], or pleasures in order to maintain or increase our level of happiness. However, as we achieve these new goals or acquire new possessions, we quickly adapt and begin desiring even more, creating a never-ending cycle of expectations and desires.
>
> Additionally, our brain's reward system plays a role in the hedonic treadmill. When we experience something pleasurable or rewarding, such as buying a new car or getting a promotion at work, our brain releases [[dopamine]], which gives us a temporary feeling of euphoria. However, over time, our brain adjusts to these increased levels of [[dopamine]] and requires even more stimulation to experience the same level of pleasure. This leads to an escalation in desires and expectations to maintain the same level of happiness.
>
> Overall, the hedonic treadmill occurs psychologically because humans have a natural tendency to adapt to changes and constantly reset their expectations based on comparison and the diminishing effects of rewards. Understanding this phenomenon can help individuals become aware of their own tendencies towards adaptation and seek alternative sources of [[The Happiness Equation|long-term happiness]] and fulfillment beyond materialistic pursuits.
