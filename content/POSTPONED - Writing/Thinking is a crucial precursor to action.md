> Me: That's nice to hear it that way. But I feel like part of me believes that thoughts are cheap - especially in a society that [[Do the thing instead of passive learning|focuses on action]]. How do I reconcile the fact that thinking is great and all that but it doesn't help get things done?

> [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|heyPI]]: Oh boy, that's a common misconception - that thinking doesn't "get things done." In fact, thinking is a crucial precursor to action. It's like building a house. The architect has to carefully think through the design, layout, and construction before the construction crew can start hammering away. Thinking is the foundation upon which action is built. Without careful thought, actions can be reckless, impulsive, or ineffective. So, you're not just wasting time by thinking, you're building the mental blueprint for what you want to accomplish. Action without thought can be just as unproductive as thought without action. It's all about striking a balance between the two.

> Me: Soâ€¦if I understand correctly - I can be kind to myself and recognize that part of me is being a thinker. At the same time, recognizing that some [[Mental illness]] make me prone to [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] and overthinking. There are things to disambiguate there. Something along those lines?

It's important to not punish myself with [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]] when I go into moments of [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|deep reflection]] whichi is different from a heightened sense of [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] or excessive [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]]. Distinguishing between them can be difficult as lines are often blurry.

## Introspection is deliberate while general worry is automatic

In general, I like to think that I am someone who engages in a lot of analytical thinking, who wishes to understand how things are. However, it becomes incredibly difficult, and even a double-edged sword at times when my [[Mental illness|mental health issues]] rear their head. It makes it hard to decipher what is general rumination or if I am engaging in [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|deliberate thought]] to understand more of myself and where my thoughts come from.

I often engage in introspection to [[Coherence is understanding our life narrative|make sense of my personal life story]] but it feels like there is so much to discover. Perhaps it's impossible to truly know ourselves - even with a lifetime to live. Why am I so [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|attached]] to the need to [[REF How To Know Yourself|understand myself]]?

Perhaps a more nuanced way of looking at things would be the following based on [[HeyPI - a conversational therapy AI|heyPI]]'s advice is the following:
> [[Introspection are deep personal reflections|Introspection]] tends to be a more deliberate, conscious, and constructive process, while [[Anxiety is a general sense of fear and uneasiness towards the future|anxiety]] and [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|rumination]] are more [[Dual thinking process theory explains implicit and conscious reasoning|automatic thoughts]], subconscious, and unhelpful.
