## Point of convergence of solutions

Related to [[Innovative ideas are on the cutting-edge]]

There is a point of convergence of solutions - similar to how evolutionary pressure tends to optimize and find a particular solution for a particular problem.

## What is multiple discovery?

This concept refers to the phenomenon where independent researchers or inventors arrive at the same solution, conclusion, or discovery at approximately the same time, without being aware of each other's work. Multiple discovery has occurred numerous times throughout history in various fields, including science, technology, and mathematics.

Some famous examples of multiple discovery include:

1.  Calculus: Independently developed by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century.
2.  Evolution by natural selection: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace both proposed this theory independently in the 19th century.
3.  The discovery of oxygen: Joseph Priestley, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and Antoine Lavoisier all contributed to the discovery of oxygen in the 18th century.

These instances of multiple discovery suggest that certain ideas or inventions are a natural outcome of the state of knowledge and technology at a given time, and that they may be "ripe" for discovery when multiple people independently arrive at the same conclusion.
