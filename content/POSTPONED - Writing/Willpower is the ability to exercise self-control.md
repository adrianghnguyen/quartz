According to Freud you. believe that self control, which is the ability to inhibit undesirable impulses, was the bedrock of civilized life.

## Willpower is like a muscle of self-control according to Roy Baumeister

American psychologist Roy Baumeister is a pioneer in the field of willpower and understanding how mental processes of the self (like making decisions and experiencing emotions) deplete the body’s physical resources.

According to him, his theory is that willpower is a muscle which can be strengthened and depleted of its strength according to evidence found in studies in labs and social settings.

> Willpower, which is generally defined as self-control, is a store of energy interconnected between the mind and body. Scientists have examined this connection by observing the modulation of willpower in relation to rising and falling levels of glucose in the body.

> Like glucose, willpower is a resource we use that can be stored up but also depleted. To optimize our strength of will toward our goals, we must do two things: **plan appropriately and create habits**. The success of a goal is largely related to the type of plan that is implemented.^[Baumeister, Roy F., Tice, Dianne M., and Vohs, Kathleen D. “The Strength Model of Self-Regulation: Conclusions From the Second Decade of Willpower Research.” Perspectives on Psychological Science 13, no. 2 (2018): 141–45.]
