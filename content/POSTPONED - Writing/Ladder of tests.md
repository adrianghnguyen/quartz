## When are ladder tests useful?

Ladder tests are most helpful when we deal with tough questions such as when information feels uncertain, we are venturing into unknown knowledge territory, facing [[Information overconsumption|information overload]], etc. All of the questions and uncertainties might cloud us from deciding on a course of action, leading to [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]].

> When investigating your options, we find it useful to think of a **ladder of tests** that go in ascending order of cost, and aim to settle the key uncertainties you’ve identified.

When testing out risky ideas with high stakes, which might lead to [[Major life decisions involve significant commitments|big life decisions]], it's best not to go [[Putting all your eggs in one basket|all-in]] but rather being prudent by evaluating options through iterations, like a [[Minimum viable products|minimum viable products (MVPs)]] strategy.

This [[Mental models make it easy for us to understand|mental model]] can serve improve the quality of my decision-making providing a framework by which I can create actions to follow to confirm my assumptions and gather feedback for insights. It's about using [[Use little bets to test for breakthrough ideas|little bets]] and seeing if they are ideas worth pursuing in terms of [[Say yes more often to embrace opportunities|new opportunities]].

## The process of creating a ladder tests

> One other rule of thumb is that the higher the stakes of the decision, the more time it’s worth investigating.

The strategy of a ladder of tests allows us to resolve these uncertainties in a systematic approach. It helps us create actions to test out the assumptions from our [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|research strategy]].

- Research and establish base information (talk to people, online research, books, etc.)
- Establish key uncertaintities (what are the assumptions which you would like to confirm?)
- Generate a list of possible options which can directly help resolve uncertainties
- Rank and prioritize the various course of action by costs (time, money, etc.)
- Starting with the option of with the lowest level of commitment, begin testing options

## A potential mental model for resolving uncertainties

> In navigating various situations, a practical mental model involves systematically ascending a ladder of tests, each addressing uncertainties and guiding decisions in an orderly fashion, regardless of the context. Here's a generalized version of the model:
>
> 1. **Foundational Understanding (1-2h):** Begin by conducting basic research, using available resources and information to establish a fundamental understanding of the options or scenarios at hand.
>
> 2. **Personalized Insights (2h):** Connect with individuals familiar with the situation to gain personalized and up-to-date insights. This step aims to tap into the knowledge of those with direct experience.
>
> 3. **In-depth Exploration (20h):** Dive deeper by engaging in extended conversations, further research, and seeking advice from relevant experts. This phase is crucial for a comprehensive understanding and informed decision-making.
>
> 4. **Hands-On Projects (1-4 weeks):** Undertake practical projects or experiments that allow for a more immersive understanding of the situation. This step serves to validate insights gained from previous stages.
>
> 5. **Mid-term Commitments (2-24 months):** Consider more substantial commitments or investments in alignment with the situation. This might involve longer-term projects, partnerships, or initiatives, with the flexibility to reassess based on evolving insights.
>
> 6. **Active Application and Iteration (Ongoing):** Continuously apply acquired knowledge and insights by actively engaging with the situation. Regularly reassess and iterate on approaches based on ongoing learning.

### Example of a career ladder test

> [!info]- Example of a career ladder of tests from [[The organization 80 000 hours|80,000 Hours]]
> Here’s an example of a ladder of tests:
>
> - Read our relevant [career reviews](https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/) and do some Google searches to learn the basics (1-2h).
> - Then the next most useful thing you can usually do is to speak to someone in the area. The right person can give you more up-to-date and personalised information than what you’ll be able to find written down (2h).
> - Speak to three more people who work in the area and read one or two books (20h). You could also consider speaking to a careers adviser who specialises in this area. During this, also find out the most effective way for you to enter the area, given your background. Bear in mind that when you’re talking to these people, they are also informally interviewing you – see our advice on preparing for interviews in [a later article](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-get-a-job/).
> - Now look for a project that might take 1-4 weeks of work, like applying to jobs, volunteering in a related role, or starting a blog on the policy area you want to focus on. If you’ve done the previous step, you’ll know what’s best.
> - Only now consider taking on a 2-24 month commitment, like a work placement, internship or [[Graduate school|graduate study]]. At this point, being offered a trial position with an organisation for a couple of months can actually be an advantage, because it means both parties will make an effort to quickly assess your fit.
