> A continuous process refers to a workflow or operation that occurs without interruption or breaks. It is characterized by a seamless flow of activities and tasks, with no gaps or downtime between them. Continuous processes are often found in manufacturing and production industries, where efficiency and productivity are crucial. They are designed to minimize waste, optimize resources, and maximize output by eliminating bottlenecks and reducing idle time. Continuous processes can also be seen in service-oriented businesses, where they ensure a smooth delivery of services to customers.
