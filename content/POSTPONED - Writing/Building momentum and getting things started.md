# Building momentum and getting things started

#status/postponed

---

I have the habit sometimes of falling into [[Analysis paralysis|analysis paralysis]], but it's important to just keep things simple and that sometimes the hardest thing is [[Show up and at least try your best|just to show up]].

Sometimes, I misrepresent how difficult things are going to be, but as soon as I get started, it may not be as challenging as it may seems. It's very easy to psyche myself out of a problem and it leads to a sense of procrastination. And then feeling like I'm not performing to my best ability, a form of [[Perfectionism|demanding perfection]], I avoid the task entirely which leads to a spiral of [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|self-hatred]].

So - what to do?
1. Break down the task into small chunks
2. Start small - look for what is accomplishable
3. Get rid of tasks which are not important
4. Find out what can be accomplished in the immediate future
5. If the task doesn't require critical thinking, perhaps it's worth [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|using smarter brains]] and copying what they do

Don't expect to do something big overnight. [[Change happens in weeks and seasons|Long-term change takes time.]]

There's a lot of advice to be learned from [[Atomic Habits by James Clear|Atomic Habits by James Clear]]
