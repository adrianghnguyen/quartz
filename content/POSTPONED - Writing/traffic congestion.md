## Downs-Thomson Paradox

[Downsâ€“Thomson paradox - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs%E2%80%93Thomson_paradox)

> The Downs-Thomson paradox is a phenomenon that occurs in transportation and traffic management, where increasing the capacity of roads or highways can actually lead to more congestion. The paradox was first described by Anthony Downs and James Thomson in the 1970s, and it has been observed in many cities around the world.
> The paradox arises from the fact that increasing road capacity can encourage more people to drive, leading to an increase in traffic volume. This can then lead to even more congestion, as the increased number of vehicles on the road leads to slower speeds and longer travel times. In other words, building more roads or adding more lanes can actually make traffic worse in the long run.
> One of the key factors contributing to this paradox is what is known as induced demand. This refers to the phenomenon where building new roads or highways attracts new drivers who may not have previously used that route due to its perceived inconvenience or inefficiency. As these drivers begin using the new road, they add to the overall traffic volume and contribute to congestion.
> Another factor contributing to the Downs-Thomson paradox is what is known as latent demand. This refers to people who would like to use a particular road or route but are currently discouraged from doing so due to congestion or other factors such as tolls or parking fees. When additional capacity is added, these latent drivers are able to take advantage of it, leading to further increases in traffic volume.
> To address this paradox and manage traffic congestion effectively, transportation planners need to take into account not only current demand but also potential future demand when designing and building roads and highways. They must also consider alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, biking, and walking as ways of reducing overall vehicle usage on roads.

## Induced demand

> Induced demand refers to the phenomenon where an increase in the supply of a good or service leads to a corresponding increase in demand, resulting in no net reduction in traffic congestion. This can happen when new roads are built or existing ones are expanded, as drivers who previously avoided certain routes due to congestion may now choose to use them, leading to increased traffic volumes and ultimately more congestion. This concept is often cited by critics of road-building programs, who argue that investing in public transit or alternative modes of transportation would be a more effective way to reduce traffic congestion.
