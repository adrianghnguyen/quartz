> Incremental change means making small, gradual improvements over time. Instead of trying to change everything all at once, we make little changes that add up over time. It's like taking small steps towards a big goal.

> For example, if we want to get [[Read slowly to process information more deeply|get better at reading]], we can start by reading a little bit every day. Each time we read, we learn something new and become a little bit better at it. These small improvements may not seem like much at first, but over time they can make a big difference. So, instead of trying to change everything overnight, we can make small changes and watch them grow into something great!

[[Atomic Habits by James Clear]]

## Grow through incremental change like a marathon

[[Humans are motivated to grow|Humans have a certain desire to become better and grow]]. Oftentimes we have an all or nothing thinking where we think that we need to put in all our eggs in a basket and go full throttle to do everything and instead it is better to treat it as a marathon and [[Manage personal energy for optimum performance|manage our energy]] accordingly.

Instead, a more effective strategy would be to [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|turn those things into positive habits]].

## Getting it wrong to get it right next time

We should not be afraid of weakness and [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|dealing with failure]]. We can take it as learning opportunities to learn how to make something great Getting something wrong allows us to know what we can improve for next time in a cycle of [[Continuous improvement is the relentless pursuit of incremental improvement|continuous enhancement]].
