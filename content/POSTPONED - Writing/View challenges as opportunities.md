# View challenges as opportunities for growth

#status/postponed

This is learning to embrace resilience as a mindset and using [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|positive reframing]] in order to navigate [[Meaning in life is most often found during hardship|difficult times]] and challenges in life. It requires a certain sense of [[Learned optimism is a skill|learned optimism]] to remind myself of this. I find that I easily default to pessimism and [[Over-identification with failure is associating our identity with past negative experiences|overidentify with failure]] which makes me [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|catastrophize]] to think that all doors have now closed. That things will not get better. But it's important to remind myself to [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|Use the Hope Circuit to fight these feelings of pessimism and hopelessness.]]

Life is a set of iterative challenges and [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|designing an ideal life requires an iterative approach]] accordingly. Very few of us get things right on the first try - so why obsess with feelings of [[Perfectionism|perfectionism]] which have been [[The garden of shame metaphor|planted in my personal garden]].

Perhaps it begins with [[Make the future you want with personal agency|establishing how I wish to personally]] view this concept in order to unroot its traces. I feel like I need to answer the following questions for myself:
1. Why do I personally experience difficulties? [[Dig deep using root cause analysis|Where does it come from?]]
2. What is the experience of difficulty like to me?
3. How do I move through it with grace?
4. How can challenges be seen as something beneficial? How does it related to a [[Growth mindset|growth mindset]]?

## Why do we experience difficulties? What is the nature of difficulties?

"[[Negative feelings and stress indicate perceived threat or challenges|Stress]] is a natural reaction to not being able to cope with specific demands and events, but [[Types of stress|ongoing stress]] can affect a personâ€™s health and wellbeing."^[ [Stress: Why does it happen and how can we manage it?](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/145855)] When we experience periods of difficulty, we tend to experience heightened stress responses which activates our [[Stress response system lifecycle|stress response system]]. Essentially, our body is gearing up for a challenge - and at times that's a good thing!  In biological organisms, we tend to experience the phenomena of [[Hormesis|Hormesis aka how small doses of stress can be conducive to growth]].

All of us are born with a different [[Personal experiences are unique like a garden|personal garden]] which has set our starting positions to tackle specific issues from a different perspective. Some of us may have had more time to develop [[Use an adaptive coping style to respond to stress positively|adaptive coping skills]] in regards to a particular issue. Life is not inherently fair nor equal - it simply is. As a result, I should learn to [[The Happiness Equation|accept my personal circumstances]] rather than lamenting about why things are. It can be challenging at times when I feel like I am [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|constantly getting in the same rut]].

From a philosophical perspective, perhaps it is overt attachment to outcome which is part of the [[The nature of human suffering stems from attachment in Buddhism|nature of human suffering]]. Perhaps it's worth not becoming overly invested by [[Wu-Wei is the art of letting things happen|letting things happen without forcing a specific outcome]].

## Overcoming difficulties leads to growth

What can I do about it? It begins by [[OODA Loop|identifying if it's happening in the first place.]] Something easier said than done. Can I do something proactively and [[Make the future you want with personal agency|take charge]] to resolve the issue?

- taking action
- being kind to yourself
- understanding that there are many opportunities which may open which we had not previously considered
- life is not a linear upward spiral

Antifragility means being able to absorb disorder manifesting as stressors on the system. The way to achieve this is through deep quality connections and the right level of interdependency in that no single failing point can take down an entire system. To promote its recovery, individual components must be able to self-correct through the stress of the situation via continuous improvement. There is interdependency between units with enough ability to maintain its own nature if the individual unit is cut off from the system.

Antifragility is a representation of a multimodal approach to providing solutions.

- [[View challenges as opportunities]]
- Remember our propensity for [[Negativity bias makes negative events more salient than positive ones]]
- If we aren't stressed, we can't enter flow state ([[Flow Triggers]])

According to [[Positive psychology focuses on what makes life worth living|positive psychology]], some of our best moments are rooted in our most difficult times.
