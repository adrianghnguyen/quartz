We should seek to maximize intelligent failures in our lives - they are the best kind. We can do so by [[Think like a scientist by embracing experimentation|thinking like a scientist]] and it can be applied in many facets of our lives such [[Career decision-making|career decision-making]]. This is [[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster|where the most personal growth can occur]].

We need to be careful of how we use intelligent failures when it comes to highly risky environments where the stakes are high. For example, aviation prototypes are first tested in simulators rather than live environments. Likewise, medicine tests in labs rather than to the general populace.

Embracing these failures help us advance and can even give us a [[Happiness is born hand in hand misery|sense of joy]]. When we receive new information which steers us in a different direction, that's a [[Changing directions from learned experiences is called growth|great learning experience]]!

I can often be [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|too harsh on myself]] but it's important to remember that [[Most mistakes we make are not that big of a deal|most mistakes do not have high stakes]].

## Failures are better seen as a process of experimentation

VALVe, an eminent game developer also experiences many setbacks and failures. But they take the method of [[Rapid experimentation|rapid iteration]] to learn from their mistakes. Through [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|positive reframing]], I can instead see the process of failure as a [[Experiment by testing new ideas|set of experiments]] - to tell us what to do and what not to do instead. Going through things firsthand is one of the [[Sources of knowledge|sources of learning]] - it's simply unavoidable.

> Missteps? How many pages do we get? We've had plenty of missteps over the years. Usually they came from us failing to follow our own process of listening to the community and understanding their needs, but sometimes they came from us having a process that wasn't particularly good in the first place.

## Criteria for intelligent failures

Therse are some of the main criteria to classify a failure as intelligent:
1. In pursuit of a goal
2. It occurs in new territory - where we may have lacked knowledge
3. Hypothesis-driven - actions are not carried out haphazardly without thought
4. Effects of failure should be minimized

When we're trying to do [[Learning new things is often difficult|a new thing in life]], we are likely to encounter intelligent failures.

## Questions to ask ourselves to create a mindset of intelligent failures

> 1. **What is it I'm really hoping to do?**
> 	- This question encourages clarity about the goal or objective you are aiming for.
> 2. **What's the progress I'd really love to make?**
> 	- It prompts reflection on the desired outcome and the impact you hope to achieve.
> 3. **What do I know currently about how to achieve that goal?**
> 	- Assessing existing knowledge helps in understanding the starting point and identifying potential gaps.
> 4. **What do I not know?**
> 	- Recognizing areas of uncertainty highlights the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed.
> 5. **What might I try next to see what will happen?**
> 	- This question encourages a proactive approach, suggesting the formulation of hypotheses and experimentation.

The mindset of intelligent failures, when it comes to general life events, helps us stay in a mindset of being proactive such as [[Job crafting|in the workplace]] or for things which we might seek to accomplish in life. [[Understanding the complexity of life|Life is unpredictable]] so when things go wrong, what's the point of [[Disliking yourself through self-hatred and self-blame|assigning blame to one self]] ? [[2023-11-12|Now]] that I think about it, when we [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|approach failure with this mindset]], it helps remind us that we always have the possibility for [[Make the future you want with personal agency|personal agency]] which can help us [[Engage The Hope Circuit to combat feelings of pessimism and helplessness|stay hopeful]].

## Minimize the effects of failures by mitigating risks

When [[Think like a scientist by embracing experimentation|conducting experiments]], it's worth mitigating risks by reducing the scope of consequencies. We can do this by building a [[Move fast with stable infrastructure|strong foundation]] and being well-informed by [[Gather information and data to provide actionable insights|gathering information]] as accurately (using [[Data-driven decision-making|data-driven decisions?]]) as possible to the problem which we wish to solve. When seeking intelligent failures to gain further knowledge, we can make sure to not [[Putting all your eggs in one basket|overcommit resources]] to our experiment through gathering good information to make [[Make informed decisions|informed decisions]].

This seems to be echoed by the advice of reducing the level of resource commitments when I am trying out a new [[A career is a path towards increasingly better work|career path]]. Something to think about in my [[Career decision-making|career decision-making]] as well as [[Designing your ideal life requires an iterative approach|designing my life]]. They mention creating an [[Ladder of tests|escalating ladder of commitments]] to really understand if it's the right career path. [[Self-discovery is about trying new things|The best way to discover more about myself is to try something]] and may it starts by doing something small to see if I even like it in the first place.

Something to keep in mind as well as I try to train myself to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe perspective]] on [[Life is a lifelong journey of discovery and series of experiments|life as a series of experiments]].
