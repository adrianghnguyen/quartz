[[Early childhood experiences exert lifelong outcomes]].

## Attuned parents reduce the likelihood of early childhood trauma

Children require attuned parents to prevent trauma.

To have children grow up with a healthy sense of [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]], they require parents who are parents who are present physically and emotionally otherwise it leads to [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|emotional neglect]]. These kind of parents encourage [[Emotion coaching is accepting all feelings and working through them|expressing emotions as an approach]].

Children with attune parents end up having more satisfying relationships later on their life and [[Create romantic attraction by creating a sexual mood|become attracted]] to healthy partners.

> Children need a caregiver who is present both physically and emotionally. It’s a caregiver who soothes you and takes care of you. An attuned parent also encourages the baby to express all emotions by accepting them.
>
> “are you angry, do you want to stop playing”?
> “happy baby, you are such a happy baby”
>
> Attuned parents raise children who are more likely to [[Build strong relationships for greater life satisfaction|create solid and satisfying relationships]] as adults. They are not attracted to people who abuse them and attract good mates with ease because they have a positive self-image (read [how low self-esteem gives you abusive relationships](https://thepowermoves.com/self-esteem-in-relationships/)).

When children become wounded, it is often a result of these two experiencefrom their primary caregivers.

> The rapture children experience and that which scars them as adults are:
>
> 1. Neglect (not attending to our needs)
> 2. Intrusion (meeting their own needs through us)
>
> The author says most children suffer both wounds as many families tend to have a neglecting parent and an intrusive one.
