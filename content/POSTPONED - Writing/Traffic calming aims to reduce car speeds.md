# Traffic calming aims to reduce car speeds

#status/postponed

## What is traffic calming?

Related to [[REF Rapid Implementation Design Guide for Bikeways in Metro Vancouver]]

Examples of calming traffic features:
- Reduced speed limits
- Speed humps or tables
- Raised crosswalks
- Chicanes
- Curb extensions

You can keep making mistakes, but physics tends to make everyone honest for their mistakes. Good luck winning against a speed bump.

## Applicability of traffic calming

> Applicability:
> - The features in this guide are best used on streets with traffic volumes **exceeding 1,000 vehicles per day and vehicle speeds of 30 km/h or greater.**
> - These features may be more desirable to area residents as they do not impede through travel of vehicles and do not require re-routing of vehicles. However, they discourage cut-through traffic and high speeds along the corridor.
> - Speed humps and speed tables are commonly used on streets with long straight stretches that allow vehicles to get up to high speeds.
> - Raised crosswalks are typically used at pedestrian crossings with high volumes of pedestrians. They indicate priority to the pedestrian and require vehicles to slow down to traverse the crosswalk.
> - Curb extensions can be placed at intersections or mid-block locations to reduce pedestrian crossing distances, improve vehicle delineation, and slow vehicles by narrowing the roadway.
> - Chicanes are generally located at mid-block locations to narrow the road and create a lateral shift for traffic. This slows vehicles down as they approach and traverse the chicane.
> Material Selection and Design Guidance:
> - Use these features on streets with appropriate traffic volumes and speeds.
> - Choose appropriate locations for each feature based on their purpose and functionality.
> - Ensure proper installation and maintenance of each feature for optimal effectiveness.

## Design considerations in traffic calming systems

> - Designers need to consider the vehicles that are required to traverse the street, such as transit buses. For example, speed tables are more commonly used on transit streets rather than speed humps as speed humps can be difficult for a bus to traverse.
> - Raised crosswalks are generally considered a more permanent feature as they may require accommodations for street drainage, such as new catch basins.
> - Chicanes and curb extensions may be installed using modular plastic curbs, pre-cast curbs, concrete barriers, or flex-posts. In these instances attention needs to be given to ensure the materials are visible to motorists and cyclists at all times of day using hazard markers and/or reflective tape.
> - Curb extensions installed using temporary materials need to consider the accessibility implications as the existing curb ramp will be set back from the crossing location. Generally, if sightlines are maintained to the curb ramp, the setback is not an issue.
