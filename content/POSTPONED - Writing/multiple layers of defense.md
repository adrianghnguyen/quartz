> The swisscheese hole error model is a [[Use concept handles to represent complex ideas|concept handle]] used in risk management to explain how errors and failures can occur within complex systems. It suggests that no system is perfect and that there are always potential holes or weaknesses that can lead to errors. These holes can be compared to the holes in Swiss cheese, where multiple layers of defense have small gaps that align to create a pathway for errors to pass through. The model emphasizes the importance of identifying and addressing these holes through various layers of defense and mitigation strategies to prevent errors from causing significant consequences.
