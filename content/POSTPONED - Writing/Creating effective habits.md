## New habits need to be introduced incrementally

Related to [[Cognitive strategies to practice humility]]

A key principle for achieving our goals is to mindfully manage the things which we do daily, whether planned or not - these are called habits. [[New habits are a result of deliberate practice|Anything practiced with patience can become a habit]].

[[Self-regulation is a limited resource that can be depleted over time|Self-regulation]] can be taxing so trying to change too many things all at once can be quite difficult and will most likely lead to failure. It is best to introduce new habits [[Incremental change|incrementally]].

### Atomic habits

> Atomic habits are small, incremental changes or actions that are performed consistently over time to create significant and sustainable results. These habits are focused on making tiny improvements in daily routines or behaviors, which may seem insignificant individually but have a compounding effect when practiced consistently. The term "atomic" refers to the idea of breaking down larger goals or habits into their smallest possible components, emphasizing the importance of starting small and [[Building momentum and getting things started|building momentum]] gradually. By implementing atomic habits, individuals can make long-lasting changes and achieve their goals more effectively.

In order to take advantage of the [[Neuroplasticity|brain's abilities to make new behaviors]], even difficult behaviors, Stanford behavioral scientist BJ Fogg shows that we need to break down behaviours into their tiniest parts similar to [[Breakdown complex problems using First Principles Thinking|first principles thinking]] - aka [[Atomic Habits by James Clear|atomic habits]].

## Introduce friction to hamper negative habits

According to [[REF The secret habits that control your life by Wendy Wood|Wendy Wood]], we should introduce friction in order distance ourselves from poor habits. Friction can take multiple forms: time, distance and [[Deliberate practice leads to mastery|deliberate effort]] all count.

### Google's M&M experiment shows the power of introducing friction into habits

Simply introducing friction into negative habits can help us steer towards better defaults.

> Version A: put M&Ms out in the open
> Version B: put M&Ms in opaque containers

> People ate 3 million! fewer calories in a single month in version B Tiny friction goes a long way. To create healthy behavior, start with healthy defaults.^[https://twitter.com/thelindazhang/status/1363318010266587136]

### Why rituals are important to me

I am starting to understand the importance of rituals. It's meant to act as a failsafe for when we fall back upon our more primitive drives. It's a form of [[Feedforward control|feedforward control]] where our past selves understands our baseline behaviours and seeks to nudge us in a positive direction.

- Engaging in my important rituals, allows me to focus on performance and time [[My core values define what matters|learning new things]] and [[Become focused by managing attention|stay focused on work]].
- It can be [[Downsides of HPI in gifted children|difficult for me to follow routines]], which makes them that much more important. I try and build incremental habits so I avoid engaging in [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|maladaptive behaviors]].
