Relationship to [[Machine Learning]] and self-learning or self-reinforcement learning cycles

[[Being wrong more often helps us grow faster]]? [[Neural Network]] are a form of adaptation

Link to how we can take our inputs and bridge the gap to outputs to obtain specific results ([[Inputs are transformed into outputs]])
