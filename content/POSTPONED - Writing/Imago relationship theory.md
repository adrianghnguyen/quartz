There is frequently a connection between [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|frustrations in adult relationships]] and early childhood experiences. For example, someone who is highly criticized as a child will be highly sensitive to their partners' criticism. For example, [[The trauma of abandonment|feelings of abandonment]], [[Emotional suppression and denial|emotional suppression]] or [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection|emotional neglect]] - all examples of [[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|early emotional wounds]], will often arise in marriage or committed relationships.

From what I remember in the book [[Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix|Getting the Love You Want by Harville Hendrix]], relationships will tend a period of deep rooted source of tension which center around these experiences.

> At some point in their relationship, couples often find themselves struggling with anger and shock, despair and sadness. Some are newlyweds, and can’t understand how they have plummeted from the heights of love and glory into a swamp of hopelessness and conflict. Others have been married for many years, and though they have been slogging along – in calm or storm – their days of wine and roses are a dim memory. Even if life at home is relatively peaceful, couples lament that they have “nothing in common anymore.” And so they lead a disappointed or angry co-existence, each with their own friends and interests, in a marriage of convenience, or an arrangement they endure “for the sake of the children.”
