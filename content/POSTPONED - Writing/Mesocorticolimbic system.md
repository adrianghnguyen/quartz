# Mesocorticolimbic system processes reward motivation and decision making

The mesocorticolimbic system consists of two pathways, the mesolimbic pathway and the mesocortical pathway, which are interconnected and work together to regulate reward processing, motivation, and decision-making.

The **mesolimbic** pathway originates in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain and projects to the [[Nucleus accumbens|nucleus accumbens]] (NAc) in the basal ganglia. This pathway is responsible for the processing of rewards and pleasure, and it releases dopamine in the NAc in response to rewarding stimuli.

The **mesocortical** pathway also originates in the VTA and projects to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), which is involved in higher-order cognitive functions such as decision-making, planning, and working memory. The mesocortical pathway can modulate the activity of the mesolimbic pathway, influencing the release of dopamine in the NAc.

Therefore, the **mesocortical pathway is part of the mesocorticolimbic system** and is connected to both the mesolimbic pathway and the prefrontal cortex, while the *mesolimbic pathway is a distinct pathway* that is primarily responsible for reward processing and pleasure.
