> This is the [[Mental illness|nature of an illness]] around which we will need to take the greatest care. We should start to get better at detecting when illness might be drawing in on us, what the triggers for it might be. Then when it is upon us, we should do and decide nothing. We shouldnâ€™t start to send emails, deliver judgement on our lives or plan for the future.

The only thing I can really do when mental illness strikes me is to recognize that something has changed, avoid [[Let the world decide the value of your work|judging myself harshly]] and decide nothing.

Based on the advice from [[REF How To Cope When Mental Illness Shuts Down Our Minds]], I should cease all [[Cognition aka the mental processes involved in understanding and processing interactions in the world|mental activities]] and simply rest. I should [[Practice self-care as a positive stress response|prioritize self-care]] such as listening to music, doing something to unwind or go take a walk. [[Overcome loneliness by stretching our social muscles|Stretching my social muscles]] isn't such a bad idea. Even if I don't feel like doing something which part of me knows will make me better, it's important to remember that [[Myth of motivation|motivation follows committed actions]].

Medication wise, [[Psilocybin|psilocybin]] has proved useful for helping me over [[Psychological impasse is feeling stuck|psychological ruts]].

## When feeling mentally ill, adopt another's brain thinking

Another way of dealing with mental illness is to [[Outsourcing my thinking by using smarter brains|hijack someone else's thinking]] who may be more healthy. I can think of a [[Traits and qualities of strong relationships|wise friend]] and think about what they would do. In a sense, I'm using the [[Fake it till you make it with the as if principles|as if principle]] to get better and hope to use their greater powers of reason until [[Impermanence and constant change is the law of nature|this moment has passed]].

## Overcoming despair requires optimism towards new opportunities

When things feel bleak and dark, perhaps due to [[Mental illness|mental illness]], it can be be easy to fall into a [[Hopelessness is loss of optimism|feelings of hopelessness]] and feeling that doors are closing upon us - bringing us into a [[Scarcity mindset|mindset of scarcity]] and thinking that [[Dysfunctional beliefs prevent us from making progress in life|opportunities are limited due to personal beliefs]].

According to this video, [How to Get Out of a Despairing Mood - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApccemGnh78), it's important to try and rekindle our imagination to see that there's always alternatives to get out of our current situation.

Don't forget that [[Learned optimism is a skill|envisioning positive outcomes is an earned skill]]. We always have the possible to [[Make the future you want with personal agency|change our circumstance]], discover new opportuntities or even build new relationships. It's important for me to learn how to [[Cognitive restructuring is the process of adopting healthier perspectives|reframe]] my [[Coherence is understanding our life narrative|personal narrative]] and move forward from [[Approach failure as an opportunity for growth|failure]] as an [[View challenges as opportunities|opportunity for growth]].
