Attachment wounds refer to emotional traumas or hurts experienced in significant relationships, particularly in [[Early childhood experiences exert lifelong outcomes|childhood]]. These can include instances of neglect, abandonment, rejection, or abuse by primary caregivers or other significant people in one's life.

These wounds can lead to attachment disorders, which can affect an individual's capacity to form healthy, secure relationships later in life. They may manifest as fear of intimacy, difficulty trusting others, anxiety, depression and feelings of unworthiness or insecurity.

Healing from attachment wounds often involves therapy, where individuals can explore their past traumas and work towards understanding and resolving them.
