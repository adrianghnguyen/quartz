# Black Box method

#status/postponed

It's a type of [[The map is not the territory|mental model]] ([[Mental models make it easy for us to understand]])

[The Black Box Method: How to Learn Hard Concepts Quickly - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDzsrmMl48I)

just focus on each step and blackbox the rest, eventually you'll learn the entire thing

It's learning to use abstraction to grasp difficult concepts.

> [!NOTE] YouTube comment, as said by Feynman Notes Guy
> Another reason why this is so effective is it forces you to understand the overall goal instead of getting lost in the small intricate steps. I often find myself thinking to much on complex scenario and forgetting what my initial goal was haha.

I guess he also likes the feynman technique ([[Learn anything like Feynman]])?

1. focus on basic concepts and dont rush.
2. find objective of learning
3. then find intermediate concepts used generally ( maybe you miss some which are not used regular but if required you can just google it )
4. revision revision , so what ever you learn just revise within 30-40 hours again then lite revision again after a week , this will create new nuro paths , later when you recall even if you forget if you get hint you recall all and then do practice to hard concepts , hope it helps and do have goood sleep and while y learn avoid social media and extra stuff and stupid relationships ( you can talk with your person or give specific time or make them busy too , my my objective is not relationship advice but to protect your brain spaces more and yes we are social being you should  hand out but under limit , priorities matters.
