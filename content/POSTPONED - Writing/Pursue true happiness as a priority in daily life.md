Pursuing [[Intrinsic happiness is deep contentment and satisfaction which comes from within|genuine happiness]] is the highest life mission, according to philosopher Thomas Aquinas. It can be considered the highest objective of [[Daily habits consist of daily actions|our daily habits]]:

> This ability helps us plan our lives, arguably increasing our chances of success. Yet, constantly dwelling on the future means we often miss living in the present. Brooks asks Whitney McFadden, who contrasts future projection with reflection, to advise on leading a successful life. McFadden proposes a reflective process of identifying things that bring joy and visualizing oneself in the future. Brooks emphasizes choice and how one can consciously opt for a life more about intrinsic values like faith, family, and friendship rather than worldly rewards. McFadden suggests this doesn't require sacrificing identity, but it can actually help regain it.
