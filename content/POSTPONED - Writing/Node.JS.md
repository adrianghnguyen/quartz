> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side to build scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js provides a non-blocking I/O model that enables developers to handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the execution thread, making it suitable for building real-time applications like chat apps, online games, and streaming services. Node.js also has a vast ecosystem of packages and libraries available through its package manager, npm, that make it easy for developers to add functionality to their applications.
