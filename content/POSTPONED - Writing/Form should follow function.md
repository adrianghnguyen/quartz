I'm thinking of writing. When you write down your ideas, you shouldn't have preconceptions of how the flow and layout should be. Jot down your ideas, revise revise revise and think of what ideas should link to one another. Build, construct, decompose, re-assemble.

Same thing applies in software engineering. You built out something, you realize that you may need to create classes/sub-classes which perform specific functions. If you begin as a monolith, as it scales, it will inevitably need to be refactored. At the same time, maintaining modularity for the sake of modularity can become a fools' errand. You may spend more time working on your management of the improvement process rather than building out work ([[Do the thing instead of passive learning]]). We can think of [[Every measure which becomes a target becomes a bad measure|Goodhart's Law]] where if we seek to build out a fully modular system, we might miss the trees for the forest. Remember that the map should not be the territory.
