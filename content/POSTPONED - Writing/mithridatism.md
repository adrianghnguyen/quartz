## Definition of mithridatism

> [!ai]+ AI
> **Mithridatism** refers to the practice of gradually ingesting small amounts of poison in order to build up immunity to it. The term originated from Mithridates VI, the King of Pontus, who practiced and advocated this method of self-immunization. He was said to have ingested small amounts of various poisons, including snake venom, in order to protect himself from assassination attempts.

> The practice of mithridatism has been used in both fiction and reality. In the Harry Potter book series, the character Horace Slughorn practiced mithridatism with antidotes instead of poisons. In reality, individuals such as the Venetian scholar and physician Giambattista della Porta claimed to have developed immunity to poisons through gradual exposure.
