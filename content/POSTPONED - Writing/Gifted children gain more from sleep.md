# Proportion of rem sleep is higher in gifted children

According to some preliminary studies, the relative proportion of REM sleep among gifted children is superior to the norm. In other words, gifted children spend more time in the REM phase of their sleep allowing greater consolidation of memories in a shorter period of time. This may serve to explain why gifted children require less sleep.

> [!quote] Higher proportion of REM sleep
> > According to some work, the relative and actual duration of REM sleep is greater among gifted children than among controls [90, 91]. In addition, a higher frequency of eye movement has been reported during REM sleep in this population [92, 93]. This data on REM sleep points overall to great cerebral plasticity and facilitation of [[Memory as Processes|memory processes]]. A large working memory capacity has also been shown across various studies [94–97].^[Vaivre-Douret, L. (2011).
