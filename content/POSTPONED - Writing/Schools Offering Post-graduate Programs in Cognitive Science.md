# Schools offering post-graduate programs in cognitive science

#status/postponed

Related to [[Cognitive science]]

I'm quite interested in the potential of going to [[Graduate school|graduate school]] if it's for something I care for.

The most popular post-graduate programs for cognitive science vary by location and institution, but here are some examples of well-regarded programs in different parts of the world:

Country | Universities offering post-grad programs in cognitive science
---| ---
United States | Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), University of California, Berkeley, Stanford University, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Michigan all offer highly ranked graduate programs in cognitive science.
Europe |  University College London (UCL) and University of Edinburgh in the UK, University of Amsterdam and Radboud University in the Netherlands, and Central European University in Hungary are among the top-ranked programs in Europe.
Canada |  University of Toronto, McGill University, and University of British Columbia offer highly regarded graduate programs in cognitive science.
Australia |  Australian National University, University of Melbourne, and University of Queensland offer strong cognitive science programs.

### Additional schools

- [Master in Cognitive Science (MASCO) | ILCB](https://www.ilcb.fr/education/master/)
	- Offer internships?
	- Some grants available
	- France

## What should I consider for graduate programs?

- How much it costs? Do I have an idea of how much I want to spend?
- I've been told that it would good to get a program which can allow a transition into a PhD program if that works for me
- A program that also gives practical experience rather than being purely research/academics focused
- Understand some of the challenges of going down this path versus trying to go into the industry directly
- Perhaps it would be worth to it to stop and look at what the job market looks like?
	- where would it lead me to?
- Some of the advice given to me by friends is understood who my potential supervisor may be
	- They'll be essentially my manager for the next few years and it would be helpful to understand where their students end up going
- Where do I feel like living?

If my goal is to enter the industry afterwards - perhaps it would be good to have a general idea of what I hope to do after the program.

## What's the general life strategy here?

- Identify what are [[My core values define what matters|my core values]] and how I envision success
- Look over the advice from [[So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport]]
- Identify if further education is the appropriate next step
- Identify potential school
- Identify my key success factors for the school
- Look and understand the overall application process for schools
- begin shortlisting schools

### What does a Machine Learning / AI software engineer do?

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> A Machine Learning / AI software engineer is responsible for designing, developing, and implementing software applications that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. They work with large datasets to create algorithms and models that can learn from the data, make predictions, and improve over time.
> Their primary responsibilities include:
> 1. Designing and developing machine learning algorithms and models using programming languages such as Python, Java, or C++.
> 2. Analyzing large datasets to identify patterns and trends.
> 3. Developing software applications that can process and analyze data in real-time.
> 4. Testing and debugging code to ensure accuracy and reliability.
> 5. Collaborating with other engineers, data scientists, and product managers to develop new features and improve existing ones.
> 6. Staying up-to-date with the latest developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies.
> Overall, their goal is to create intelligent software applications that can automate tasks, provide insights from data, and improve decision-making processes for businesses or organizations.

### What do AI researchers do?

This looks interesting to me.

> [!ai]+ AI
>
> AI researchers work on developing and improving artificial intelligence technologies. They may work on tasks such as [[Natural Language Processing (NLP)|natural language processing]], machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. AI researchers use a variety of techniques such as statistical modeling and deep learning algorithms to create intelligent systems that can learn from data and adapt to new situations. They may work in academic or industry settings, and their research can have applications in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.

## Tuition costs of foreign schools
