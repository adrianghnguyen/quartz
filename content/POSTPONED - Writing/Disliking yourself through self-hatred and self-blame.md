# Self-hatred and self-blame leads to a dislike of the self.

Related to [[Emotional neglect is characterized by a lack of childhood affection]]

Self-hatred is having intense feelings of dislike, disgust or aversion towards ourself. It is a strong [[Emotions are interlinked with biology|emotional state]] which involve a negative perception of our [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|personal worth]], [[Self-efficacy is the belief in our ability to succeed in a particular domain or task|capabilities]], and overall [[Personal identity is what makes us who we are|sense of identity]]. Those who experience a lot of self-hatred can sometimes engage in [[Maladaptive behaviors prevent you from adapting to difficult circumstances|self-destructive behaviours]], have low self-esteem and struggle with self-acceptance.

As for myself, I know I have intense feelings of self-hatred buried deep down which leads to an excessively harsh [[Dealing with our inner critic|inner critic]]. I know that I had a difficult childhood, but it can be challenging to [[Forgive yourself for past traumas|forgive myself for my past traumas]] and come at it from a perspective of acceptance. Learning to [[Forgiveness increases well-being|forgive]] the one who hurt me is something I go through in ebbs and flow. I guess I should accept it as a cycle rather than expecting a linear journey of success.

I think the ability to pinpoint when I am in an emotional state of self-hatred can help me concretize my experience with which I can meditate and let the thought pass by. This is an important reminder if I ever start hating myself for making mistakes. It's okay and I should learn to [[Everyone makes mistakes so be kind|forgive myself for making mistakes]].

When I feel stuck in the cycle of self-hatred, I can find it easy to [[Rumination and repetitive thoughts|ruminate]], begin [[Catastrophizing is imagining worst case possible scenarios|catastrophizing]] and [[Emotional suppression and denial|deny my emotions]].

When I want to dream big and accomplish things, I should remember that I can let fall away the negative parts of the inner voice. To remind myself that [[Self-criticism is not necessary to develop motivation|I don't need self-criticism to develop motivation]].

## Mourning and acceptance of early emotional wounds can help us overcome self-hatred

I understand at a logical level that at a logical level self-hatred may stem from early deprivation and it seems like the advice to move through it constructively is to undergo a grieving process. I need to understand, question and mourn the love I may not have received in order to help heal my [[Self-esteem is how much you like yourself|self-esteem]].

> Liberation comes from recognizing that self-hatred stems from early deprivation, not inherent flaws. By understanding, questioning, and mourning the love they didn't receive, individuals can overcome self-hatred and realize their own worth.

[[Early emotional wounds are negative early life experiences|Early emotional wounds]] are always hard to overcome - but I've come a long way so far. I'll choose to tell myself this as a [[Engage in positive self-talk to overcome the inner critic|positive message]]. At times, I feel like it may make it difficult to hold onto the fact that my [[Life significance is having an appreciation for how our life has inherent value|life has value]]. It does - I hope I don't ever forget about this in my periods of darkness or when my [[Mental illness|brain shuts down]].
