# How I manage my Obsidian vault by implementing PKM practices which work for me

Here are my personal guidelines for my knowledge management and principles:
1. Keep filename shorts and directive 'as a claim'. They often appear in linked mentions and should help me situate what the note is about before it is even opened. No more than 7 words when possible.
	1. Concepts serve as hubs of content and may have shorter names rather than statements if they're still sprouting
2. H1 should be a thesis or an opinion on the subject or overall concept and how to apply it. When I hover over it, I want to know what I should do with the concept.
3. Make descriptive aliases as sentences. That way they can be 'rapidly' plugged in like a 'though API'
4. No raw links. Use aliases.
5. Keep metadata structures shallow if possible. Broad strokes are preferable to overly granular. But [[Complex structures should emerge from simple systems|sometimes things need to be simple before they can become more complex]].
6. Tag structures should be kept generic and broad.
7. Reuse or repurpose existing [[Obsidian metadata management|properties/metadata YAML fields]] when possible. Stretch the definition as appropriate.
8. Search for existing tags before creating a new type. Can it fall under other categories? Use `Ctrl+ALT+F` to search for tags.
9. It's okay to lose content over time, you might just bump into it again. That's natural.

## Best Practices

- [Write notes on one idea with propositional titles.](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point1)
	- **Art is a means of disclosing reliable, true knowledge.**
	- **American Puritans of the late 18th century were highly literate.**
	- **Linking ideas together helps us remember ideas and use them.**
	- It is easier to remember a _claim_ than to a vague title
- [Let structure emerge.](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point2)
	- Don't try to plan out everything. Adapt as you go.
	- It takes [[Experiment by testing new ideas|trial and error]]  to get things right. The Obsidian vault will change organically with time due to [[Complex structures should emerge from simple systems|Gall's law (systems law)]].
- [Figure out ways to let notes “bump into” each other.](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point3)
	- Try to ascribe meaning to notes rather than copying things verbatim.
	- One technique is to write why something in particular was meaningful.
	- Make ideas atomic/self-contained.
- [Break down tasks into discrete steps](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point4)
- [Take small bites every day.](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point5)

## Things to avoid

- [Do not write long notes with many ideas](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point6)
- [Do not box yourself into rigid structures](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point7)
	- **Tags are a means of loosely associating notes**. If links are directly related notes, then a link like "pragmatism" or "epistemology" might loosely link two notes. To me, it’s a speculative connection- the effect I want is "if I search this tag, what kind of notes do I want to bump into?" Furthermore,
	- **It should be possible to narrow down relevant searches by adding more tags to the search term.** If you search my vault, you are likely to get more notes than are helpful if you search "#art". However, if you add some qualification (such as a sub-tag like "#art/institutions" or another tag like "#entertainment) the notes that come up should be reduced in number and closer to what I’m trying to read about.
- [Don’t write bad links](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point8)
- [Don’t do it all at once (you won't finish everything)](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point9)
- [Don’t imagine a day when you’ll catch up.](https://www.nickseitz.com/writing/obsidian-day-one-starterpack#point10)
