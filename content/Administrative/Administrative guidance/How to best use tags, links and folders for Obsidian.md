# How to best use tags, links and folders for Obsidian

- **Folders** are fantastic for categorising your notes into organisational buckets.
	- places - people - magic items
- **Links** are fantastic from creating links between notes.
	- Bob lives in the town and owns this magic item.
- **Tags** are useful for filtering and querying your data and these days as a way of defining a variable that can be referenced within the notes. It also let's you define more elements of a note.
	- age: adult - health: healthy - job: blacksmith - religion: worships the devil - guild: Purple Dragons
	- Attributes (or fields) in Dataview are defined either in the Frontmatter in the form `key: value`, or in the body of the text as `key:: value`.
	- In a sense, tags are a type of field that Obsidian pays extra attention for.
